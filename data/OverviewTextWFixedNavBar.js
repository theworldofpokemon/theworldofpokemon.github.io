["Unknown","When Bulbasaur are born, their mothers plant seeds on their backs. The plants form symbiotic relationships with their hosts, growing alongside the Pokémon and providing them with sustenance. By lying about in the sun, Bulbasaur allow the plants on their backs to photosynthesize and produce energy, which they can then use for themselves. The plants are able to become mobile by virtue of their active hosts, allowing them to move out of shaded areas and thus benefiting them as well. Additionally, Bulbasaur can utilize their plants to perform Grass- and Poison-type attacks such as Razor Leaf and Poison Powder. The attacks protect both the Pokémon and the plants from harm. In the wild, Bulbasaur tend to be very rare, as they are shy creatures that prefer the company of their own kind. However, they are also generally very docile, tame, and loyal to people that they trust, and for that reason are one of the species of Pokémon available for starting trainers to choose in the region of Kanto.","Upon evolution from Bulbasaur, Ivysaur become larger and more powerful. However, as a trade-off for their bulk, they also lose their ability to stand on their hind legs due to the mass of the bulbs on their backs. Their legs also grow stronger to compensate for the extra weight. Ivysaur are able to naturally learn the powerful Grass-type attack Solar Beam, a move whose execution time depends largely upon the weather; it takes an excruciatingly long amount of time to perform this attack in hail, rain, or a sandstorm, but nearly no time at all in bright sunlight. Luckily, the latter is ​most common in the habitats of these Pokémon, as it is vital that the bulbs on their backs receive ample sunlight so that they can photosynthesize and develop. As the bulbs grow larger and these Ivysaur become more powerful, they must spend increasing amounts of time in the sun in order to foster their growth. When Ivysaur are preparing to evolve into Venusaur, they will spend more time sunbathing and their bulbs will begin emanating a sweet, pleasant aroma.","The final evolution of Bulbasaur, Venusaur are powerful but relatively nonviolent Pokémon. Despite their menacing appearances, Venusaur are docile Pokémon, preferring to sunbathe so that the plants on their backs can photosynthesize rather than fight. They follow sunny patches that reach the forest floor as the sun moves across the sky. With enough solar energy, the flowers on their backs can release a fragrance that calms both hostile Pokémon and people alike. The scent also attracts a number of Bug-type Pokémon to the flowers as well to aid in their pollination during the breeding season. This ability allows Venusaur to serve as peacekeepers of sorts in their native forests, not only stopping fights that break out in their territories, but also defending their domains from dangers with their might if necessary. Female Venusaur have seeds in their flowers, which they plant into the backs of their offspring to grow into new plants. Their gentle dispositions but great power are what make them one of the most well-rounded Pokémon any Kanto trainer could start their Pokémon journeys with.","Charmander are rare Pokémon not often found in the wild, making their homes in volcanoes and mountains--particularly those with nooks and crags that can easily provide protection from the weather. This is because the flames on their tails are directly linked to their well-being. A flame that burns brightly signals a healthy Pokémon, while a dim, sputtering flame indicates a sickly one. Charmander will die if their fires go out. Their flames steam when in high humidity, warning them of potential danger. These flames also indicate their emotions. Gently wavering flames signal happiness, while blazing tails mean anger. Despite being Fire-types, Charmander are not immune to fire; infant ones, in fact, often burn themselves on their own tails. However, like many Fire-types, they do have an affinity for hot things, and their skin does toughen as they age. Despite the many dangers and precautions raising Charmander may pose,  they still remain one of the most popular starter Pokémon for trainers in the Kanto region.","Charmeleon have been described as “vicious,” “barbaric,” and perhaps most fittingly, “hot-headed.” They can easily raise the surrounding ambient temperature to unbearable levels simply by swinging their tails around. Charmeleon attack by knocking their foes down with their blazing tails and slashing them mercilessly with their sharp claws, not ceasing until their enemies are thoroughly beaten. In their fervor, their tails often begin to burn a bluish-white; at night, they can light up mountainsides like stars if groups of them are present. Enraged Charmeleon often take out their anger on their surroundings, incinerating anything flammable around them with unrestrained Flamethrowers. This stage is often likened to a human’s teenage years--moody and reckless. For starting trainers, reining in disobedient Charmeleon can be extremely challenging, as well as potentially dangerous if not handled well. However, with proper care and treatment, a trainer can earn a Charmeleon’s respect, and eventually its obedience as well.","Charizard can spew powerful flames that can melt boulders and glaciers--and rather unfortunately, also easily and unintentionally start forest fires. For this reason, it is common courtesy to recall any Pokémon that have uncontrollable flames (like the ones on the tails of Charizard) back into their Poké Balls in heavily forested areas. A Charizard’s flame temperature increases with training, and it is said that Charizard that have experienced particularly brutal battles have even hotter flames. Like Charmeleon, an enraged Charizard’s flames can burn a whitish-blue. Unlike them, however, Charizard can more easily control their their tempers; they will nobly never attack foes weaker than themselves. Charizard can fly almost 4,600 feet (1,400 meters) into the air, soaring far above the mountains and volcanoes they call home. Trainers who manage to protect their vulnerable Charmander and then deal with their moody Charmeleon are rewarded with noble and powerful Charizard to call their own.","Squirtle are born with soft shells, and are vulnerable until these shells harden in a process that takes about a week or so. To protect themselves, they withdraw into their sturdy shells and attack using Bubble and Water Gun to scare off potential dangers. Their carapaces can bounce back many attacks, protecting the Pokémon from harm. Additionally, the smooth exteriors of the shells allow Squirtle to glide more swiftly and smoothly through the water. Though rare in the wild, they can occasionally be found around freshwater lakes and ponds, and even in slow-flowing rivers. A few ​isolated populations can be found on islands in the middle of the ocean, but these groups are rare and are exceptions rather than the norm. Squirtle are often found in groups, which while officially are referred to as “bales,” are more popularly known as a “squads.” Squirtle, the third of the Kanto starter trio, are often viewed as a middle ground between the other two; not as docile as Bulbasaur, but not as rash as Charmander.","As semi-aquatic Pokémon, Wartortle can stay submerged underwater for long periods of time, holding air in the rich fur of their tails. These tails, rather humorously, stick out of their shells even when the rest of their bodies are withdrawn. They use water to cloak themselves before attacking prey and swiftly swimming after them, using their ears and tails to balance themselves. Wartortle are said to live 10,000 years; it is thought that individuals with more deeply-colored tails and more algae on their shells are older. While this holds true to an extent, Wartortle have not actually been documented to live this long, though they regularly surpass 100 years of age. Because of this, Wartortle tails are regarded as symbols of longevity. In the past, people would hunt Wartortle and hold locks of their tail fur in hopes of living long lives. Wartortle pride themselves on scratched shells, as they show toughness in battle. Generally, it is believed that the more scratches a Wartortle gains during this stage, the stronger it will be after evolution.","Blastoise are powerful Pokémon that are most famous (aside from being a part of the Kanto starter trio) for the cannons on their backs. These cannons are stronger than fire hoses, and can shoot water over 160 feet (50 meters) away with enough force to break through concrete and solid steel. Additionally, Blastoise can use these cannons to jet themselves through the water to tackle foes at high speeds. Blastoise intentionally make themselves heavy for multiple reasons. Weight adds power to these jet-tackles, for example, and also allows them to crush foes on land. Most importantly, however it enables them to withstand the recoil from their powerful cannon blasts.  These blasts are accurate as well as powerful; bullets of water shot from these cannons can hit and destroy tin cans situated 160 feet away. As a last resort, Blastoise can withdraw into their thick and sturdy shells for protection. Like the other Kanto starters, Blastoise are extremely powerful Pokémon that any Pokémon trainer would be lucky to have.","Caterpie are common Pokémon in Kanto and Johto forests; they are also occasionally found in Sinnoh and Kalos as well. They are ravenous eaters, often consuming leaves larger than themselves with ease. As weak, soft-bodied Pokémon, Caterpie attempt to gather as much energy as possible to hasten their evolutions into Metapod, and afterwards into Butterfree. However, they are not completely defenseless and do have a few tricks up their sleeves. Firstly, the large eyes on their heads can trick and confuse predators into thinking they are dealing with much larger Pokémon. Secondly, the suction pads on their feet allow them to climb nearly any surface and escape from predators. Additionally, Caterpie can use String Shot to slow down their enemies and buy time for escape. Finally, the antennae on their heads release a very noxious odor when disturbed. These defense mechanisms allow Caterpie to thrive in their native habitats, and combined with the large clutch sizes of Butterfree, make them are one of the most common Pokémon trainers encounter in forests.","When preparing to evolve, Caterpie spin cocoons around themselves. These cocoons, while still vulnerable when soft, will eventually harden into iron-hard casings, triggering their evolutions into Metapod. A Metapod’s only defense is to use Harden; when under attack, they weather blows by raising their defenses, though extremely hard blows can occasionally crack their shells and expose their weak, liquid-like innards. They must conserve their energy to prepare for their final evolutions. To avoid attacks, these Pokémon stay motionless and simply ​wait. Metapod are remarkably patient, enduring whatever pain they must to reach their final stages. They must remain upright while biding their time or risk spilling out their innards. They are often regarded as nearly useless in battle, as freshly-caught Metapod are incapable of damaging foes at all (other than by using Struggle). Luckily, however, the Caterpie line undergoes some of the quickest evolutions known to date, and it does not take very long for Metapod to finally evolve into Butterfree.","The final stage of the Caterpie line, Butterfree evolve from Metapod and gain the ability of flight in the transformation. The wings they gain can let loose Poison Powder in battle; they are also water-repellant, allowing Butterfree to fly even in torrential rain. Butterfree consume honey from flowers and are excellent at detecting sources of it. They can trace minutes amounts of pollen back to flower patches, where they then feast on honey and nectar. Using the hairs on their legs, Butterfree are also able to carry the sticky substance back to their nests. They often fly as far as 6 miles (10 kilometers) to find nectar in blooming flowers. These Pokémon also have powerful compound eyes. Because of their water-resistant wings, Butterfree can often be found fluttering about in the misty upper levels of rainforests. However, the high moisture is not necessary for their survival; they are simply highly tolerant of it, so they are also found in drier forests as well, often flying in small swarms to search out locations where honey is abundant. They sometimes compete with Cutiefly for territory.","Like many of their fellow Bug-types, Weedle are found in forests, most commonly in Kanto and Johto (though also occasionally in Sinnoh and Kalos as well). They are voracious eaters, consuming their weight in leaves daily. Though they appear helpless at a first glance, Weedle are in fact poisonous. The 2-inch (5 centimeter) barbs on their heads secrete a poison that, while not fatal, can be debilitating and cause moderate nausea, dizziness, and mild swelling at injured areas. The abundance of Weedle in dense forests makes accidental injuries and subsequent poisonings a very ​common problem among travelers. Trainers are advised to always carry Pecha Berries or Antidotes with them and to watch their step in Kanto and Johto forests. The stingers and brightly-colored bodies of these Pokémon are intended to ward off potential predators who would not enjoy a mouthful of toxins. Weedle also have a sharp sense of smell, using their nose-like proboscises to sense which leaves are safe to consume. Some Weedle even develop preferences for certain leaves.","When close to evolution, Weedle seek out trees, branches or piles of leaves to hide in; when they evolve into Kakuna, their ability to move becomes severely restricted, and they can only inch about very slowly. They can sometimes be seen hanging from tree branches on strands of silk in large numbers. Kakuna can only learn Harden naturally. When provoked, though, they can also extend poison barbs from their tips slightly to defend themselves. These Pokémon try to conserve as much energy as possible for evolution, however, so they will only exert energy to unsheathe their barbs when absolutely necessary. Their hard cocoons protect the soft bodies within, which essentially liquify as they reconfigure themselves for evolution. This process, a fervor of activity that contrasts their immobility, causes their internal body temperatures to rise drastically, so much so that the shells of Kakuna nearing evolution feel uncomfortably hot to the touch. Their bodies only continue to heat up as they draw closer to their final transformations.","Beedrill appear to be fierce Pokémon, and rightly so. They have three venomous stingers, one on their abdomens and two on their forelegs. Beedrill are extremely territorial, attacking anything that perceive as threats in swarms. They fly in at high speeds and jab foes with their stingers before taking them back to their nests for food. Theoretically, avoiding Beedrill swarm territory should allow travelers to avoid confrontation with these Pokémon. While this is true, complications arise when considering the fact that Beedrill are a rather abundant Pokémon; the combined territories of multiple swarms can take up the majority of a forest. While dangerous, however, Beedrill are also vital to the ecosystems of Kanto and Johto forests, helping prevent populations of Pokémon such as Paras and Pidgey from growing uncontrollably. Trainers traveling in Beedrill territory are strongly advised to bring along Pokémon that can handle Beedrill and their attacks, such as Twineedle and Poison Jab, as well as to bring along a number Pecha Berries and Antidotes.","Pidgey are very docile Pokémon that prefer to avoid confrontation with other Pokémon and humans altogether, hiding in tall grass to prevent themselves from being seen. If cornered, though, they will attempt to escape by using Sand Attack to blind foes or Whirlwind to blow them away and buy themselves time to fly away. When hunting, however, Pidgey often use these attacks to stir up their surroundings, exposing vulnerable insects for them to chase down. These Pokémon have extremely keen senses of direction. They can always find their way back to their nests regardless of how far they have flown. Because of this, Pidgey were commonly used to send messages in the Kanto and Johto regions (much like the Wingull of Hoenn), at least until the advent of e-mail. Many Pidgey have grown accustomed to and now dwell in urban areas due to this practice, flying to forests and fields only to hunt for food before returning back to their nests in cities. Some people still train Pidgey to deliver messages as a way of preserving tradition.","Upon evolving from Pidgey, Pidgeotto become much braver, no longer shying away from confrontation. They are also fiercely territorial, patrolling the skies above their domains by flying slowly in circular patterns and watching for both intruders as well as prey. Pidgeotto have outstanding vision, and are able to locate prey over a mile (1.6 kilometers) below. When they spot something, such as a Caterpie for example, they will dive down and attack with their sharp talons and powerful beaks. Like Pidgey, they have keen sense of direction in addition to their strength; Pidgeotto can carry ​prey back to their nests with ease, and can travel over 60 miles (100 kilometers) in the process. Due to their extremely territorial natures, most urban Pidgey nearing evolution migrate, often in flocks, to the nearby forests where they hunt; they then split up and stake out their own territories. This phenomenon is notably only present in metropolitan Pidgey--Pidgey in less densely-populated, rural areas often will stay where they are upon evolution.","Pidgeot, the final stage of the Pidgey line, are less docile than their first stages, but not as hostile as their second. While still territorial, they no longer attack others for simply entering their turfs; rather, they wait and use their keen eyesight to watch from far away, seeing whether their intruders have ill intentions. If they are not endangering the Pokémon or their offspring, they will leave them be. However, they will defeat potential threats without hesitation using their powerful chest muscles to whip up windstorms strong enough to bend tall trees. While hunting, Pidgeot can spot prey from 3,300 feet (1,000 meters). They dive down to lake surfaces to snatch splashing Magikarp with their sharp talons, reaching speeds of up to Mach 2. When approached, Pidgeot will spread out their wings to intimidate foes. If the tactic fails, they will quickly resort to flapping their wings to create powerful gusts before attacking with their talons. The beautiful, glossy feathers on their heads are symbols of speed in popular culture.","Rattata are common Pokémon, often found in the fields and urban areas of many regions. They live in large groups of 40 to 50 members, and are almost never separated; if one finds a Rattata dwelling in their home, it is certain that there are dozens more hiding around as well. They can be a nuisance, as they eat nearly anything and are extremely quick, seemingly unable to stay still for long periods of time. If a Rattata locates food, it will call upon its group-mates to join it. They will then settle in the area and reproduce continuously. In addition to consuming ​large amounts of food, Rattata also pack a vicious bite. They can potentially pass diseases through puncture wounds. Their teeth never stop growing, so they must constantly gnaw on hard objects to whittle them down or risk starvation, unable to close their mouths. They often use manmade objects such as telephone poles for this purpose. All this together makes Rattata huge household pests, so many employ Pokémon like Meowth and Glameow to deal with them.","Evolving from Rattata, Raticate remain just as much a nuisance to homeowners, only more aggressive. Luckily, however, they also live in smaller groups, as large groups Rattata generally split into groups of 8 to 10 or so upon evolution. Like their pre-evolutions, Raticate must constantly whittle down their teeth. In the wild, they gnaw on rocks and logs to keep them in prime condition, but urban Raticate often choose to whittle on concrete and cinder walls of houses, a danger to many homes. Their whiskers provide them with balance; if they are damaged or cut off, the coordination and speed of these Pokémon are cut drastically. Their hind feet are adapted to swimming, allowing them to easily cross rivers. If a Raticate feels threatened, it will stand on its hind legs and let out an shrill shriek, calling its group-mates to join and defend it. The best way to defend against Raticate in the home is to prevent Rattata from invading in the first place before they evolve. Alternatively, Persian and Purugly can also deal with Raticate.","Spearow can fly very high and fast, but expend a lot of energy flapping their tiny wings to do so. Because of this, they can only fly for short distances. They flush out bugs by flapping their wings in tall grass to create gusts, like their relatives Pidgey. Spearow are highly aggressive and territorial, closely observing their land and letting out high-pitched shrieks that can be heard from over a half-mile (a kilometer) away to alert fellow Spearow of potential dangers. Though territorial against other Pokémon, Spearow are not solitary and will coexist with others of their kind. Their calls signal nearby Spearow to flock together and attack. Because they almost always attack in large flocks, Spearow can be very formidable foes despite their small size and individual weakness. Lone Spearow can be reckless when facing large foes, however. Flocks can be dangerous to unwary travelers, so trainers must always be cautious of Spearow cries while traveling through their territory. Farmers appreciate them, though, for clearing fields of pests.","Like Spearow, Fearow are very territorial; luckily for travelers, though, they prefer to keep to themselves, only attacking those who draw too near to their nests or young. They enjoy flying, often spreading their large wings and soaring effortlessly through the air for up to 24 hours without landing; they can carry heavy loads in their talons in flight. When hunting, Fearow soar high up into the air. When they spot prey, they dive down below and attack (often the common Rattata or their fellow Flying-type Pokémon Pidgey) with their long beaks. They use their narrow beaks to dig through soil or reach below the water to catch prey if needed. Because they are known to attack Pokémon often viewed as “cute” and “popular”, such as Pichu, Fearow are often maligned in popular culture as wicked, heartless fighters. However, anyone who has ever raised a Fearow know that while wary and sometimes aggressive to strangers, they can also be very loyal and protective Pokémon; archaeologists have found carvings of them protecting people in Johto.","When first born, Ekans lack any poison whatsoever, so being bit by very young Ekans is unlikely to be too dangerous (apart from the pain of the bites themselves). As Ekans develop, their bodies elongate and they begin to develop poison glands. Ekans use their poison more as a defense as opposed to an offense. They mainly prey on the defenseless eggs of Pidgey and Spearow. Using their tongues to sense their surroundings, Ekans are able to locate nests of eggs with ease. They can unhinge their jaws and swallow eggs whole, though unlucky Ekans may end up immobile from the sheer weight of those eggs until digestion (or even fainted if attempting huge eggs). Hiding in tall grass, Ekans avoid predators and warn those who approach with a rattling sound from their tails. Should the sound fail, they will attempt to paralyze attackers with Glare, and as a last resort bite opponents to poison them. Ekans often coil around tree branches to rest if they are available, but are also content to curl up into spirals so their heads can easily attack potential predators when threatened.","Arbok are vicious hunters--and vengeful ones at that. If attacked, they will chase down opponents relentlessly until they catch them. Arbok are masters of intimidation. The patterns on their bellies can paralyze foes in fear. These belly patterns differs from area to area. If the patterns alone are insufficient, they can also make eerie hissing noises by expelling air slowly from their mouths. Once their prey are immobilized, Arbok will constrict them with a crushing force able to flatten steel oil drums. They can easily poison stronger foes, weakening them enough for them to constrict easily. ​Surprisingly, Arbok are rather adept swimmers as well, capable of crossing lakes and rivers effortlessly. Notably, Arbok seem to become mesmerized and peaceful upon hearing the sound of wind instruments like Poké Flutes. An Arbok in the middle of constricting its prey will even loosen its grip upon hearing such sounds. Because of this, Poké Flutes have become one of the most reliable ways to deal with aggressive Arbok, with some cultures even developing performances out of the art.","Pikachu are social Pokémon that live in groups in secluded forests, rarely interacting with humans at all. These groups, if large enough, can create small electrical storms in cloudy weather. Pikachu are very cautious Pokémon, keeping their sensitive tails raised to detect minor changes in the atmosphere--a telltale sign that danger may be near. Their tails are sometimes struck by lightning during the storms they create in these poses. If a Pikachu’s tail is disturbed, the Pokémon may attack the offender by biting or using Thunder Shock. Wild Pikachu will touch tails to greet one another. They store electricity in their cheek ​pouches, which are believed to recharge while they sleep; Pikachu with stronger electricity are said to have softer, more elastic pouches. Pikachu are also very intelligent and friendly to their own kind. They are known to shock hard Berries to roast and tenderize them as well as give fellow Pikachu small shocks to recharge them. Pikachu are popular as the unofficial “fourth starter” of the Kanto region, with many trainers opting to start their journeys with Pikachu as opposed to one of the three traditional starters.","Raichu are a rarity in the wild, as exposure to Thunder Stones is necessary to catalyze their evolutions from Pikachu. Most Raichu are trainer-owned, though there are a few in the wild living in areas near their Pikachu brethren. Raichu can unleash extremely strong electrical attacks reaching up to 100,000 volts at a time for their more powerful moves. They ground their tails to discharge excess electricity from into the earth, leaving behind scorch marks. Their strong electrical powers lead them to constantly exude weak electrical charges, causing them to glow faintly in the ​dark. These Pokémon can draw electricity straight from the atmosphere simply by raising their tails. Their electricity levels are directly linked with their moods; a Raichu with little electricity is weak and depressed, while one that is filled to the brim is powerful and even aggressive at times. Notably, an angered, fully-charged Raichu’s ears stand straight on end, a warning sign for enemies to quickly back away.","Sandshrew live in arid climates, as they hate water. They create burrows underground for shelter. When hunting, they wait near the lips of their burrows, lunging out at unsuspecting prey. Sandshrew can roll up into tight balls when endangered to protect their soft underbellies. Their hides can bounce off many attacks, and are additionally also great shock absorbers. A Sandshrew falling off a cliff, for example, could save itself by rolling into a ball; it would be able to not only survive the impact, but even crawl away mostly unscathed. Their bodies are also configured to live off as little water as possible, since they are extremely weak to the liquid. Sandshrew often curl up into balls on cold nights to prevent dew from building up on their bellies. If wet, they will sunbathe or even travel to volcanic areas to dry off. While rolling up is a sufficient defense against most enemies, Sandshrew can also use Sand Attack and curiously Poison Sting to defend themselves, as their claws secrete a mild poison. Recently, researchers have discovered that their saliva in fact contains the same poison.","Sandslash are known for their ability to roll up into balls. However, for them, it is not a fully defensive tactic. Sandslash can roll around in their spiky armor and ram into foes, severely damaging them with their spikes. Their claws also make them great climbers, so it is not uncommon for them to launch aerial spike-attacks at opponents from trees. They can also slash enemies with their sharp claws, if the spikes on their hides were not enough. However, Sandslash prefer not to fight, and will often simply roll away from confrontation or quickly roll around to whip up cloaks of sand for them to escape. Sandslash burrow through soil at great speeds; occasionally, they move so quickly that one their spikes or claws snap off. Luckily for them, though, these can grow back in as little as a day. Their spikes naturally fall off as new spikes replace older ones; discarded growths were once used by farmers to plow fields. Sandslash also have a two-fold resistance to the heat: they can curl up to protect themselves from the arid sun or burrow into the cooler earth. In favorable weather, they may even climb into treetops to take naps.","These small Pokémon are extremely timid and docile, but also extremely venomous. Even a tiny drop of the venom they excrete from their barbs can be fatal. To make matters worse, Nidoran♀ are easily spooked, and it is not at all difficult to accidentally be scratched by a fleeing individual. If cornered, however, Nidoran♀ will defend themselves with their horns; while these horns are smaller than that of the males of this species, they still nevertheless are very dangerous. They may attack with Poison Sting or Double Kick as they try to escape, the former of which incapacitates foes ​while the latter knocks them back, allowing the Pokémon to flee. It is rare to find a lone Nidoran♀, as they are very social Pokémon that are almost never seen without elder Nidorina and Nidoqueen, or at the very least sibling Nidoran♂, accompanying them. In fact, the vast majority of documented cases of Nidoran♀ poisonings have been attributed to skittish and scared wild individuals attacking out of sheer terror after having been separated from their families.","Most Nidoran♀ cease evolution after becoming Nidorina, as they can only evolve again  when they come into contact with the relatively rare Moon Stone. Like Nidoran♀, Nidorina tend to avoid confrontation but are fiercely defensive of their young, battering enemies with physical attacks such as Crunch, Double Kick, and Poison Fang when their children are threatened. Like the rest of their relatives, they lives in burrows in open plains with their large family groups. Unlike those of Nidorino, a Nidorina’s horn and barbs grow rather slowly, as it is not necessary for them to develop quickly because they are very rarely used (males do most of the defending in a family). These Pokémon are very affectionate with those in their tightly-bonded family groups, and can easily become nervous or even upset when separated from them. Nidorina withdraw their spikes when interacting with family members to prevent themselves from harming each other. To feed their young, they first chew food before spitting it out for their children to eat.","Since they evolve with the use of a stone, Nidoqueen are rather rare in the wild. They lead Nidoran families alongside Nidoking. These Pokémon are famously motherly, willing to defend their young with their lives. Nidoqueen are powerful Pokémon that are able to execute a variety of powerful special and physical attacks like Earth Power and Superpower. They will tackle foes who threaten their young with their massive bulk. Their tough armor and needle-like scales provide them with protection; they bristle outwards when Nidoqueen are provoked and can inject a powerful, incapacitating poison. These Pokémon will block the entrances to their burrows using their bodies, with their venomous spines facing outwards, in order to defend their young. Nidoqueen are also known to set off earth-shaking tremors to scare potential attackers from their burrows. Younger Nidoran♀ and Nidorina look up to Nidoqueen--it is not uncommon for wandering Nidorina to end up lost in the mountains while searching for Moon Stones to evolve like their mothers.","The males of the Nidoran species (who are notable for being the only species considered two separate Pokémon based on gender), Nidoran♂ have two main assets: their large ears and their poisonous barbs. Their muscles allow for their ears to move freely. They can hone in on the smallest sounds. By hiding in tall grass and raising and stiffening their ears just above it, Nidoran♂ can scan their surroundings and use their ears to detect danger from far away. To defend themselves, they can extend toxic spikes from their bodies or stab enemies with their horns by using Poison Jab. The toxicity of their barbs directly correlates to their sizes, but even small barbs can be extremely dangerous. Like females, however, males are shy and try to avoid fights, only using their venom to defend themselves as necessary when confronted. Nidoran♂ are herbivores and consume plants as their main source of food, and can even devour toxic ones without any ill effects; some scientists even believe that Nidoran♂ gather their poison from such plants.","Unlike their pre-evolutions or female counterparts, Nidorino are highly aggressive. They use their ears to listen for any possible dangers. If they sense one, they will lunge at it immediately with their large, poisonous horns. These horns are strong enough to pierce diamond. Once they stab their opponents, Nidorino quickly pump in large amounts of venom to incapacitate them (a Nidorino’s horns will leak out venom slowly from the impact, but the Pokémon can exert energy to increase this rate). Like those of Nidorina, the barbs on their bodies bristle when they sense danger or are preparing to attack. These Pokémon generally spend the day scouting and searching for food, returning to their burrows only at night to rest. They bring back resources to share with the rest of their families. However, even the slightest noise will awaken sleeping Nidorino, thanks to their highly sensitive ears. They will not hesitate to locate the source of a foreign sound and attack it with their horns, especially if the threat appears to be endangering their young.","﻿Nidoking tend to be rare in the wild due to the fact that they require Moon Stonse to evolve. In Nidoran families, Nidoking assume the roles of protectors and hunters, patrolling in search of food to bring back to their burrows for their mates and offspring. They use their brute strength and steel-like armor to overpower their foes, crushing their enemies with their tails and piercing them with their poisonous horns, which, like those of Nidorino, can break diamonds. An enraged Nidoking is particularly dangerous, as it will go on a rampage that can only be stopped by defeating the Pokémon--a difficult task that only a few Pokémon can accomplish. Nidoking can easily topple transmission towers and snap telephone poles, and will destroy everything in their paths while rampaging. Threatening their families is one of the most common triggers for such attacks. Luckily, their rarity in the wild in combination with their tendency to stay away from human settlements makes berserk Nidoking a very rare, albeit still very dangerous, problem in most metropolitan areas.","Clefairy are mysterious Pokémon. Believed to have extraterrestrial origins, they make their earthly homes on mountains like Mt. Moon in Kanto and Mt. Coronet in Sinnoh. They can also be found in the Giant Chasm of Unova, a mysterious site with ties to outer space. Their habitats tend to have odd magnetic activity. Little is known about these elusive Pokémon; however, they seem to be intelligent enough to form societies, build transportation, and develop religions. Many theories have formed regarding these popular Pokémon. One explains their tendencies to steal things as gathering materials to build spaceships to take them back home. Known for their mystical powers, Clefairy can use the move Metronome by waggling their fingers, summoning a completely random attack out of thin air. They also very strongly connected to the moon. Clefairy mysteriously become more common during full moons as they come out of hiding and dance. They worship Moon Stones (which trigger their evolution), and allegedly store moonlight in the wings on their backs to float in midair. Despite their rarity, their cute appearance and voice have made Clefairy popular symbols in media and merchandising.","Unlike most stone-evolved Pokémon, Clefable are almost as plentiful as their pre-evolutions (though this isn’t saying much, considering their rarity). This is because of the strange link between the moon and Clefairy—somehow, there are always Moon Stones near them, triggering some of their evolutions. Clefable are extremely shy, hiding at the slightest hint of people. Their ears are very sensitive, able to hear a pin drop from 1,100 yards (1,000 meters) away. They avoid loud places by hiding in groups deep in secluded mountains. Clefable move very lightly, almost as if bouncing in lower, moon-like gravity; they are also able to walk on water in this way. On moonlit nights, they can rarely be seen walking towards secluded, deserted lakes; they are said to gaze at the moon in longing to return home. It is said seeing a pair of them is a sign of a happy marriage. Little is known about how Clefable defend themselves; they are able to learn Metronome like Clefairy, allowing them to summon essentially any move. Their affinity with Moon Stones is still present, and they can occasionally be seen holding them as they wander about. ","Vulpix are born with only a single, white tail. As they mature, their tails split and turn a shade of vermillion that deepens the more affection the Pokémon receive. Vulpix have internal flames that never die out, radiating heat throughout their fur. They may release flames from their mouths to expel excess heat and cool themselves down on hot days. They often attack foes with Fire-type techniques such as Flamethrower and Ember, but also have control over a few Ghost-type moves like Confuse Ray, Hex, and Grudge. Vulpix are often associated with the attack Will-O-Wisp, which they use to chase down prey. To escape from foes, they may feign injury to buy themselves time to flee. Though they generally make their homes in grassy plains, as Fire-types, Vulpix also can be found near volcanoes in large populations—and curiously enough, also near cemeteries such as Mt. Pyre in Hoenn. Vulpix can spew fire that are said to resemble lost souls, leading many to believe that they have a very close tie with the spirit world. Young Vulpix grow quite attached to their trainers, much like their relatives Growlithe.","Upon exposure to Fire Stones, Vulpix will evolve into Ninetales. Like the majority of other stone-evolved Pokémon, Ninetales are rare in the wild due to the scarcity of the stones required for their evolutions. Legend has it that Ninetales are the embodiments of 9 reincarnated saints or wizards, and that they are extremely vengeful Pokémon who will lay 1,000 year curses on anyone who so much as touches one of their nine tails; such curses may even extend onto the offender's descendants. The Pokémon themselves are said to live 1,000 years. It is also believed that each of their tails holds a different power; a Ninetales would lay a different curse on a handler depending on which tail was touched. These Pokémon are highly intelligent and can fully understand human speech. They are also said to be able to manipulate others; staring into their glowing red eyes would allow them to take over one’s mind. Their fur is said to turn more golden and lustrous the older they become. Despite all of these claims, none of these myths about Ninetales have ever been scientifically proven to be true. Ninetales spew enchanting, flickering flames from their mouths to entrance and hypnotize prey before attacking.","Jigglypuff are most well-known for their ability to sing people and Pokémon alike to sleep. They sing at a wavelength that matches the brainwaves of a person in deep sleep, causing all who hear them to become immediately drowsy. CD recordings of their singing are sold as sleeping aids. They have a vocal range of over twelve octaves, though they rarely exercise it in full. In battle, Jigglypuff enrapture foes with their huge eyes before singing them to sleep; they then use Pound and Double Slap to assault them. They can also inflate their bodies, giving them the name “the Balloon Pokémon.” In addition to allowing them to easily float upon the winds, this ability also increases the air capacity of their lungs and allows them to sing for for longer periods of time, letting them lull foes into even deeper slumbers. However, most Jigglypuff are not accustomed to Pokémon with abilities like Insomnia, which prevent drowsiness. They will sing endlessly to try to put such Pokémon to sleep, putting themselves in danger of asphyxiation. Luckily, this behavior is generally a one-time mistake, and a Jigglypuff will quickly learn its lesson. Recently, it was discovered that different populations of Jigglypuff utilize different methods of singing, ranging from lilting melodies to near-shouts.","Wigglytuff, like Jigglypuff, can inflate their rubbery bodies like balloons. They grow steadily to enormous sizes to scare off foes; the largest purportedly could grow to 20 times its resting size, though this specimen was never proven to exist. Once inflated, Wigglytuff can float and bounce around lightly like balloons. They compete with one another to see who can become the largest. Their large eyes are always covered with a thin layer of tears that wash away any particles that fall onto their delicate surfaces. Wigglytuff fur is also unimaginably soft. Sleeping next to a one is said to be an amazing experience, and a few quirky luxury hotels tote Wigglytuff “sleeping buddies” for extra charge—a practice that benefits both person and Pokémon, as Wigglytuff love the company of people. Their fur, in fact, is so supple that it is said if two Wigglytuff were to hug, they would never let each other go of each other because they themselves cannot get enough of their own fur. This fact is not true; the old wives’ tale originated as a way for an embarrassed father to explain to his child the spectacle of two Wigglytuff mating. Wigglytuff shed their fur each season; people gather this fur to weave into yarn.","One of the most common cave Pokémon worldwide, Zubat can be found in every known region. They form huge colonies in caverns, numbering up to thousands of individuals. Without eyes or noses, Zubat navigate the winding dark caves using echolocation. They emit ultrasonic cries to fly safely, using their keen hearing to detect potential dangers. At night, Zubat may leave their caves in large groups, with as many as 10,000 individuals having been documented leaving from caverns where they are more abundant, such as Mt. Moon. They search for food on these nightly flights, which,contrary to popular belief and unlike the diets of their evolutions, consists mostly of nectar, fruits, and Berries. As daylight approaches, Zubat must return to their caves or other dark places, as the light of the sun can burn their delicate skin. To stay warm on cold nights, they will huddle together in groups as they sleep. Zubat defend themselves with moves like the disorienting Supersonic and attacks such as Leech Life, which they may use on unwary, intruding travelers. Scientists have recently discovered that Zubat colonies each use slightly different freuencies to echolocate.","Like Zubat, Golbat are found in caves and dark areas worldwide. Unlike Zubat, however, Golbat are hematophagous, consuming the blood of Pokémon and humans alike. They use their sharp fangs to puncture the skins of victims. Their saliva contains a substance that poisons and immobilizes prey, allowing them to drink blood at their leisure. Golbat can drink up to 10 ounces of blood in one sitting, possibly fatal for smaller victims. After doing so, however, their flight often becomes clumsy and erratic due to their heavy weights after large meals; they may become so heavy that they fall to the ground (and become easy prey themselves). Luckily, this feasting keeps them satisfied for a while; they only search for food during moonless nights when darkness conceals them. Their fangs are hollow and consequently fragile. Notably, Golbat avoid light, metal (perhaps due to their poison being ineffective against Steel-types), and oddly enough, Durin Berries. While no one is quite sure why, Golbat tend to steer clear of them despite experiencing no ill effects upon consuming them.","Oddish are nocturnal Pokémon that bury their bodies in the soil during the day, exposing only the leaves on their heads. They can easily be mistaken for weeds when like this--but if one pulls on an Oddish’s leaves, it will let out a horrible shriek. If that is not enough to deter predators, these Pokémon can use moves like Poison Powder, Stun Spore, and Sleep Powder to inflict a variety of status conditions upon foes. Their feet act as roots when buried in the soil, absorbing nutrients from the earth. Healthier Oddish have glossier leaves. When exposed to moonlight, Oddish uproot themselves and begin to wander aimlessly in search of fertile soil. Along the way as they travel, they disperse some of their seeds onto their paths. Oddish leaves are known to be poisonous, and at the very least, cause surreal hallucinations upon consumption. For a brief time, people would consume Oddish leaves recreationally, but the craze quickly ended when the more toxic side effects, such as permanent liver damage, were discovered. Recently, scientists have discovered that Oddish can in fact photosynthesize using moonlight rather than sunlight.","Gloom are most famously known for their horrid stench. Their putrid odor can make people gag from over 1.25 miles (2 kilometers) away. From a closer distance, one sniff can cause temporary memory loss and fainting. Though the smell is unbearable to most people, there are a select few individuals, roughly 1 in 1,000, that actually enjoy the smell (notably including every trainer and Gym Leader Erika in the Kanto Celadon Gym). The “drool” from their mouths is actually a foul-smelling honey, used to attract their insect prey. In a constant cycle, the smell of the honey cause Gloom to become excited, which in turn cause them to produce even more of their putrid honey, and more of their equally foul pollen as well. Despite the smell, however, Gloom honey is reportedly sweet once one overlooks the stench. It is a very sticky substance, however, that is difficult to remove from clothing. Notably, while an alarmed Gloom releases even more rancid pollen than normal, a calm one will release next to no smell at all.​","The giant flower on a Vileplume’s head holds most of the Pokémon’s mass. With the largest petal-to-body ratio in the world, Vileplume actually have trouble holding up their heads due to the sheer weight of their flowers. Studies show that the larger the flowers are, the more poisonous their pollen is. The smell of the flowers attracts prey; when they draw close, Vileplume flap their petals, cloaking themselves and their targets in toxic pollen that quickly immobilizes victims. Even as they walk, Vileplume scatter pollen out of their blooms, turning the surrounding air a sickly yellow. This pollen can cause poisoning and paralysis in large amounts, but can also trigger massive allergy attacks in even trace amounts. Like Oddish and Gloom, Vileplume may hide partially buried in the soil, only exposing their flowers for unwary prey to investigate. Because of this, it is unadvisable to approach large flowers in swamps or jungles, as they may actually be Vileplume in disguise waiting for an opportunity to scatter pollen.","Paras are covered in fungal spores upon birth, specifically that of a variety known as tochukaso. As a Paras grows, so do the mushrooms on its back. Paras feed by burrowing and sucking nutrients out of tree roots; in turn, the mushrooms drain nutrients out of their host Paras’s bodies. Paras must feed ravenously as a result. Recent discoveries have shown that the mushrooms also control part of their hosts’ brains, and in fact are the ones that signal for Paras to burrow for roots. Paras can be found in damp, dark areas where fungi thrive; sunlight and dryness can damage their bodies. To defend themselves, the fungi release spores to inflict a variety of status effects upon foes. Paras are sometimes seen as pests, as they harm tree roots. However, since they generally live in areas away from humans, they normally cause few problems. The mushrooms on their backs are actually considered very valuable in traditional medicine. They are dried and ground to create a powder said to grant consumers long lives; however, tochukaso from Alola are said to be of a lower quality.","When Paras evolve, their fungi entirely overtake their bodies and minds. Parasect dwell in damp places due to their fungi’s own preferences for moisture (they often compete with Shiinotic for land). They swarm at the roots of trees, draining them until there is nothing left before moving on to new trees together. They are highly aggressive, attacking foes with their claws and using moves such as Fury Cutter. The mushrooms on their backs also scatter poisonous spores around them; the larger the fungus, the more virulent the toxins. These spores are steeped into teas in traditional medicine; it is said spores from Parasect in Alola are weaker and less effective. They can also utilize the move Spore, which puts opponents into deep slumbers. Parasect fungi are also prized as medicine. collectors are known to pay large sums of money or teach trainers’ Pokémon new moves in exchange for these valuable “Big Mushrooms.” Throughout their lives, the mushrooms continues to drain their hosts until there is nothing left. At that point, they scatter spores over their hosts’ eggs to restart the cycle. If a Parasect's mushroom is entirely removed, the Pokémon enters a comatose state indefinitely.","Venonat are nocturnal Pokémon that dwell in dark places like dimly lit forest floors. They hide in tree hollows until nightfall, when their main sources of food emerge. They eat tiny insects that flit about the dark undergrowth. Venonat are attracted to light and can commonly be seen swarming around lampposts near the forests where they live. The bristly hairs covering them protect them from predators by making them unappetizing meals. Venonat also ooze poison from all over their bodies as a secondary defense mechanism. Their large compound eyes can sense tiny movements in the ​darkness, allowing them to easily hone in on their tiny insect prey. Additionally, their eyes also function as “radar units” of sorts, alerting them to potential dangers lurking about. Venonat can use their eyes to defend themselves by firing beams, such as when using the moves Psybeam and Signal Beam; both attacks can confuse and disorient targets. Venonat can also utilize moves such as Poison Powder and Poison Fang to debilitate opponents as well.","Venomoth, like Venonat, are nocturnal and are attracted to bright lights and open flames. Luckily for them, so are their prey. Venomoth still feast on tiny insects that swarm near lights in the darkness, making hunting for food an easy task for these Pokémon. Venomoth have scales on their wings that fall off as they flutter about. The scales leach poison upon contact, which can inflict a number of different status conditions depending on the color of the scales: a dark cloud of scales poisons victims (Poison Powder), a lighter cloud paralyzes them (Stun Spore), and a cloud with a color roughly between the two other puts them to sleep (Sleep Powder). Venomoth will purposely flap their wings vigorously when in danger to releases these noxious scales. They may also attack with other moves in their arsenals, including Silver Wind, Bug Buzz, and Confusion. Though not common in the wild, particularly powerful Venomoth can utilize the move Quiver Dance to increase the power of their moves as well as their agility greatly.","Diglett are very popular yet very mysterious Pokémon. They mostly live underground eating plant roots and insects, but pop up on the surface or in caves from time to time. However, they never reveal any more than their heads; to this day, no one knows what the rest of a Diglett’s body looks like. As Diglett tunnel through soil, they leave the land perfectly tilled for crops. This makes them very popular among some farmers, who gladly let a few of them loose into their fields. It is a mutually beneficial relationship; the Diglett till the soil for the farmers, and in turn are allowed to eat the roots of some of crops before harvest. They can be huge pests in fields they should not be in, however. Diglett traveling near the surface often leave trails of displaced soil, making them rather easy to track. Diglett cannot stay aboveground for long, as their thin skin is especially sensitive to light. Excess exposure to the sun can cause them to overheat, weakening them greatly. They makes most of their aboveground travels at night for this reason.","Though Dugtrio look like three Diglett huddled together on the surface, it is unknown whether or not they are actually fused underground; like Diglett, no one has ever seen the underground portion of a Dugtrio. What is known, however, is that a Dugtrio’s three heads tend to think identically as triplets, as opposed to separately like other three-headed Pokémon such as Dodrio. Upon evolution, a Diglett’s single head splits into three separate ones, enabling it to burrow and plow soil at three times its original rate. By loosening the soil with their heads, they also make the earth easier to burrow through. Dugtrio can dig at 60 mph (100 km/h), and can cause minor earthquakes by doing so at depths of over 60 miles (100 kilometers) below sea level, easily burrowing through even hard bedrock. To defend themselves, Dugtrio burrow deep underground so that their opponents cannot locate where they will strike. Then, they surprise foes by emerging behind them and attacking with moves like Earthquake and Magnitude.","Meowth are urban Pokémon that make their homes in towns and cities (a few feral Meowth also dwell in the forests bordering such cities). They are nocturnal in nature, sleeping through the day and prowling the streets at night. While generally solitary, Meowth are known to form groups that band together in search for round or shiny objects, both of which they treasure. When they find round objects like balls, they will often play with them until they tire out and fall asleep. On the other hand, when Meowth find shiny objects--most commonly loose change dropped by people--they will hoard them in large, hidden piles, which they will only share with those they trust deeply. The coins on their heads glow when they find shiny things. When stalking, their eyes gleam brightly in the moonlight. Moewth retract their claws to muffle their steps. Meowth prowl about to defend their hordes from their archenemies, Murkrow, who also have a fondness for shiny things. Meowth and Murkrow will try to steal from each other’s stashes and will duel in alleys for piles of coins. Wild Meowth will quickly befriend anyone who gifts them with shiny objects, but will lose interest just as quickly once they stop receiving presents.","Persian are haughty creatures that are popular amongst Trainers who love their fur or desire sophisticated Pokémon. However, they are extremely difficult to control and are prone to slashing those that make eye contact with or displease them (which is nearly everyone) with their claws, leaving deep gashes. The jewels on their heads glow in the darkness. Persian judge each other by the sizes of their jewels. In some regions, poachers target these Pokémon for these shiny growths. Despite their fickleness, Persian are very graceful creatures—another reason why they are so popular. Their lithe muscles allow them to walk silently while remaining ready to pounce at any second. Persian use their whiskers to scout around their domains, sensing air movements and using the information to plan their attacks accordingly. They will become docile, however, if these whiskers are grabbed or damaged. While some trainers remove their Persian’s whiskers to prevent them from lashing out, some see this as form of abuse, as their removal strictly limits a Persian’s abilities to hunt, battle, and defend itself.","Psyduck suffer from constant headaches, and for that reason are always holding their heads in pain; sometimes they even cry as a result. However, when their pain worsens, they gain psychokinetic powers on par with many Psychic-types. Curiously, once the majority of their suffering subsides, they are unable to remember such incidents, as if they underwent amnesia immediately after every psychic episode. This causes them much confusion; they are always is in a state of bewilderment as a result, tilting their heads slightly to one side. At one time, it was believed that Psyduck used their vacant stares to fool predators into thinking that they were easy prey before attacking with their psychic powers. However, we now know that Psyduck have no control whatsoever over their powers--in fact, the majority of their brain cells are dormant, in a state very similar to that of a person in deep sleep. Psyduck gain their abilities when these cells become active, but as soon as they retire, they completely forget about their powers again. Recent research has shown that their brain cells become hyperactive during their migraines, increasing activity by as much as tenfold. Some studies show that a mild positive feedback loop may exist between their brain activity and psychokinesis, such that using psychokinesis activates their brain cells and activating their brain cells increases their psychokinesis; as a result, these Pokémon try to think as little as possible and instead stare blankly into space.","Golduck are no longer plagued with headaches like Psyduck. They can now control their mild psychic powers entirely. As a result, they can utilize moves like Confusion and Zen Headbutt—Psychic-type moves—at will, in addition to Water-type moves like Water Pulse. The gems on their heads glow when using their psychic abilities; they were once thought to be imbued with their power, leading them to be overhunted in the past. Golduck are exceptionally fast and graceful swimmers. They may need to relocate to larger lakes and rivers after evolving to give themselves ample room because of this. Using their webbed limbs, they can easily outspeed even the fastest human swimmers, and as such can make quick work of agile fish; they may even use their psychic abilities to disorient and disable their prey before catching them. Surprisingly, Golduck rely heavily on their tails for swimming strength, stamina and maneuverability in addition to their limbs. Golduck can swim for two days straight without rest. They can often be seen gliding agilely through the water at dusk in slower rivers (though they have no trouble with currents). Most scientists believe that Golduck, with their duck-like appearances and crepuscular natures, are the inspiration behind the mythical kappa, a common myth in regions like Kanto and Johto.","Mankey are known for their incredibly short tempers. Even the slightest provocation can send them into fits of rage. Their bodies shudder uncontrollably and their nostrils flare up right before they strike. Then, they launch relentless flurries of attacks at their foes before they even get a chance to retaliate or escape. Despite their temperaments, Mankey are very social Pokémon that live in groups in the treetops. If one Mankey is angered, the entire colony will attack. In their huge frenzies, they are unable to tell friend from foe and may even attack one another, becoming even angrier. They are very agile creatures, able to swing in the trees to chase foes. If they lose track of their colonies, they will be infuriated by their own loneliness and attack everything they see. They may pass out from their tantrums, but be so angry in their dreams that they reawaken, and then become further enraged by the interruption. Notably, they enjoy bananas, Chesto Berries, and chestnuts, but their inability to peel the latter greatly enrages them. In Alola, it is said that Mankey live a long time because they never hold in their anger.","Many people consider Primeape wrath in its physical form. These Pokémon will become uncontrollably angry if they even sense someone might be looking at them. Running from one will initiate a chase. Primeape will not give up on their targets, chasing them relentlessly and channelling all of their efforts into pursuing their foes until they collapse from exhaustion. They will never forget the face of a foe that angers them, even after beating them down. When enraged, their bodies redirect blood from their brains to their muscles, increasing their strength and endurance, but also clouding their thoughts; Primeape that become too angry may even die from the redirected blood, which may be the only time that they are peaceful. This immediate arousal appears to be an instinctual response; even Primeape awoken from sleep will chase offenders, lethargically but still unyieldingly. Recent studies show that their blood vessels are in fact stronger than those of other Pokémon, allowing them to withstand higher blood pressures without bursting. To the surprise of many, Primeape are exclusively herbivores, eating bananas, Chesto Berries, and chestnuts, like Mankey. Unlike Mankey, however, Primeape are able to simply channel their inner rage against chestnuts to punch them open.","While wild Growlithe make their homes in hot areas, such as volcanoes or plains burned by wildfires, they are also a common sight in cities, where they are often under the ownership of the local police force. Their amazing senses of smell and olfactory memory allow them to never forget scents, helping police officers trace crimes back to their culprits. They roar loudly when they suspect criminals may be near to spook culprits out. In a pinch, they make good lie detectors as well, as Growlithe are abnormally good at sensing human emotions. However, exceptionally strong odors ​may sometimes overpower their sensitive noses and temporarily disable their senses of smell. Growlithe are also extremely loyal, defending their trainers by barking at or biting anyone that appears dangerous. However, they will obey commands unerringly, and will always wait for instructions before attacking. Growlithe are fearless Pokémon that will not back down from even the largest and strongest of enemies. In Alola, these Pokémon commonly will fight for territory with their relatives Rockruff.","With the use of Fire Stones, loyal and courageous Growlithe evolve into magnificent and majestic Arcanine. In the past, Arcanine were revered as legendary Pokémon along with the likes of the legendary bird trio in the Kanto region. One was said to have been the partner of a mythical general who conquered an entire nation with Arcanine by his side. By the modern definition, though, few would consider them legendary Pokémon at all--this does not mean they are not popular Pokémon, however. Arcanine are said to be able to run over 6,200 miles (10,000 kilometers) in a day. They are thought to look like they are flying when running due to their grace and beauty. Strong fires burn within these Pokémon, allowing them to use many powerful Fire-type moves. Though rare in the wild, Arcanine can occasionally be seen dashing across prairies, gathering food and storing it in their manes to bring back for their young. Their deafening roars can silence enemies. They can also defend themselves with moves such as Extreme Speed. Though they may not be legendaries, Arcanine still command great respect with their awe-striking power.","Poliwag are amphibious Pokémon, capable of life both on land and in water. That being said, however, they are much better at swimming in the water with their tails than walking on dry land with their feet; terrestrially, they are very clumsy, often falling and rolling around helplessly. Still, they try to venture onto land in order to strengthen their legs, though they will flee into the water at the first sign of danger. Their skin is so thin that light can pass through it, rendering it transparent. The spirals on their belly, actually their innards, can differ in direction depending on which side of the equator the Poliwag was born; those with clockwise spirals are from the northern hemisphere, while those with counter-clockwise ones are from the southern hemisphere.. Their skin must be kept moist at all times--when not in the water, they are in constant danger of drying out.  As a result, they rarely stray too far from the water’s edge (if they leave it at all). Their thin skin also leaves Poliwag particularly vulnerable to water pollution, which they can easily absorb. Their swirls will pale when they are ill. However, this skin is also very flexible and slippery, bouncing off the fangs and claws of attackers. Poliwag primarily feed on algae and lily pad roots. They are skittish Pokémon that hide from foes amongst aquatic plants.","Poliwhirl are amphibious. Though they are not nearly as clumsy on land as Poliwag, they still prefer to remain in the water, where they have fewer predators. Poliwhirl must constantly keep their skin moist. When out of water, they achieve this by sweating a slippery, oily fluid all over their bodies. This substance has the added effect of making Poliwhirl difficult to hold on to in battle, as they can easily slip and slide out of the grasps of opponents. By undulating the spirals on their bellies, Poliwhirl can perform Hypnosis to lull opponents to sleep. This buys ample time for them to escape. Their hands are also developed enough to perform a variety of palm-based moves such as Double Slap and Wake-Up Slap, the latter of which they often use with Hypnosis to bring down particularly bulky foes. Both Poliwhirl and Poliwag are mesmerized and drawn to to the cries of Politoed, and will cease whatever they are doing to locate and congregate around the source of such noises. They have been shown to even respond to audio recordings rather than actual Politoed.","Poliwrath are uncommon in the wild because they need Water Stones to evolve. Regardless, they can rarely be found in moist areas (as Poliwrath must always keep their skin wet), including damp caverns. When dry, they will begin to sweat profusely in order to stay moist. Unlike their pre-evolutions, Poliwrath prefer land over water. They are still very strong swimmers, however; they can outswim human Olympic swimmers without even tiring. Poliwrath can even briefly run across surfaces of water for brief moments using their strong arms and legs; their bodies are nearly all muscle and no fat. They can swim using similar strokes that humans use, like the butterfly and breaststroke. Different populations seem to have different preferences, though they enjoy teaching others their style. Their muscles are conditioned so that they do not get tired, letting them walk or swim nearly indefinitely. Poliwrath are also more confrontational than Poliwhirl in that they will not shy away from conflicts, though they are by no means aggressive. ","Abra are notorious for being difficult for beginning trainers to catch. Their only known move is Teleport, and will not hesitate to use it when confronted, teleporting away from potential threats to safety. Trainers must either throw their Poké Balls immediately or prevent their escapes to catch them. Abra are masters of teleportation; they can warp quickly enough so that they appear to be in in multiple places at once. However, this requires great effort and concentration of psychic energy, often tiring them out. As a result, Abra will sleep up to 10 hours a day. If they do not get enough rest, their psychic powers may be weakened. Even when Abra are asleep, their bodies can still sense impending attacks or danger and warp them away without waking up (they may consequently awaken bewildered by their locations as a result). Studies have shown that even when unthreatened, Abra will instinctively teleport about once an hour. Abra can also read the minds of foes, helping them plan out their escapes. According to popular legend, a person can sneak up on an Abra if he or she completely clears his or her mind before approaching, as the Abra will not be able to sense his or her presence.","Upon evolution, Kadabra no longer need to rest for long periods of time. They can also now use moves other than Teleport to defend themselves, though they still maintain the ability to do so if cornered. Their psychic powers increase with adrenaline, so a Kadabra in danger may be able to perform more powerful attacks than usual. These Pokémon emit strange alpha waves from their brains, which can induce headaches in those around them and cause electronics to malfunction. Only trainers with strong minds can stand to train these Pokémon, as they seem to be less affected by these strange waves. By staring at their silver spoons, they can focus their energy; without one, their strength is halved. Curiously, this only seems to work with silver, with no other metals being of any use to them. A Kadabra’s alpha waves can cause clocks to run backwards and shadows to appear on TVs. These silhouettes are said to bring bad luck to those who see them. When Kadabra focus on their spoons or close their eyes, the strength of their psychic powers increases. A popular legend states that there was once a boy with psychokinetic powers that, while trying to learn more about them, mysteriously transformed into a Kadabra.","Alakazam are highly intelligent Pokémon that are capable of unleashing devastating special attacks. Their brain cells multiply indefinitely, allowing them to remember everything and calculate difficult equations at speeds rivaling supercomputers. Their IQs are said to be over 5,000 (though at that point the scale ceases to mean much). Their huge brains weigh so much that their necks can no longer support them; they must use their psychic powers to support them instead. Older Alazakazam have larger heads. Alakazam can close their eyes to increase their strength. They exude so much psychic energy from their brains that those nearby may develop headaches. Their spoons are thought to have been created purely of this energy, though this has not been proven. An Alazakam can recognize its own spoons from another's, leading some to believe each pair is completely unique. These Pokémon will gift one of their spoons as a sign of utmost affection, and according to folklore anything eaten with a gifted spoon will taste sublime. In battle, Alakazam use their intellects to their advantage. They quickly calculate variables like type advantages, chance of missing, and so on. These factors make Alakazam popular choices for Psychic-type Pokémon amongst trainers, using their great minds to strategize in battles.","Making their homes in mountains, these pint-sized powerhouse can toss a hundred adults with ease. Machop are determined Pokémon that are never satisfied with the amount of effort they are exerting. Their muscles never tire or cramp, so they can continue training and lifting almost indefinitely. Machop practice all styles of martial arts. Using the mountainous terrains in which they dwell to their advantages, they are often seen practicing by hurling Geodude and lifting Graveler that also live in these areas (much to their dismay). If there aren’t any of these Pokémon around, Machop can also make due with similarly-sized boulders. A Machop can lift a sumo wrestler above its head without breaking a sweat. The majority of their body composition is pure muscle, allowing them to perform these amazing feats of strength. They can throw powerful punches and kicks thanks to their constant and relentless training, allowing them to utilize Fighting-type moves such as Karate Chop, Low Kick, Vital Throw, Cross Chop, and even Dynamic Punch. In areas where they live alongside Makuhita, they will sometimes challenge them to battles after sparring with their own friends.","Like Machop, most Machoke make their homes in mountains, but many also spend some of their time in urban areas helping with heavy lifting in construction sites (a job they share with their fellow Fighting-types, the Timburr line). Their belts aren’t just for show; they must be worn at all times, as they regulate the Pokémon’s powers and restrain them to nonlethal levels. Machoke have incredible stamina like their pre-evolutions, not tiring even when doing the most strenuous of activities. They are always focused in battle, trying to get the most out of their training sessions. A Machoke’s muscles are as hard as steel; they grow after every battle. Machoke can easily hold sumo wrestlers up with just a single finger, and entire dump trucks with just one hand. These Pokémon enjoy helping people and other Pokémon lift heavy objects, as these tasks are great training for the Machoke themselves. When their services are not required, they will return to the mountains to continue lifting and training themselves to become even stronger. In contemporary sculpting, Machoke are also popular motifs and even models for sculpting classes.","Machamp are tremendously powerful Pokémon, capable of move mountains with just a single hand. They use a variety of fighting techniques to pummel their opponents, most of which involve all four of their limbs. For example, they may use three of their arms to hold down foes while using the fourth to deliver a punch strong enough to knock them over the horizon (or derail a train, as one infamous incident had proven; luckily, no one was hurt in the accident). Alternatively, they may instead execute a different move with each of their limbs--for example, an uppercut, a hook, a straight, and a karate chop all simultaneously with their four limbs. They can deliver swift, endless volleys of punches to relentlessly pummel down opponents. There is even a special name for a complex grab these Pokémon perform using all four of their arms: \"the Machamp special\". Machamp love challenges, and will only fight harder when faced against strong opponents. However, they are terrible at delicate, precise work; their arms get jumbled together when attempting to manage fine details, and they will often end up destroying whatever they were trying to work with in the first place.","Bellsprout prefer to make their homes in humid, tropical habitats. They are insectivores, capturing their prey by rooting themselves into the ground and camouflaging as plants before lashing out their vines to ensnare small, unwary insects. Their roots also draw water and nutrients from the soil. However, they are unable to run while rooted, making them easy targets for predators while trying to hunt. Bellsprout are quick at capturing prey, dissolving victims with acid from their mouths strong enough to melt through iron. Their flexible bodies allow them to swerve around most attacks, giving them time to uproot themselves from the soil and escape from attackers. Their flexibility is the reasoning behind the name of the Sprout Tower in Johto. The pillar in the middle of the tower sways gently from side to side like a Bellsprout’s stalk. A popular legend in Johto says that at one time, the pillar was in fact a giant, 100-foot tall Bellsprout that eventually became the swaying pillar that holds up Sprout Tower.","Unlike Bellsprout, Weepinbell will eat just about anything that moves. They attack prey with Poison Powder and Acid, swallowing them whole and letting their internal acids digest them. If they can’t swallow their meals, they will cut them up into more suitable chunks using Razor Leaf. Weepinbell must protect themselves from their own acid by also secreting neutralizing fluids so that they don’t dissolve their own bodies. When resting, they hang from tree branches using the small hooks behind their heads. Tropical trees with clear acid burns on their bark were likely inhabited by colonies of Weepinbell at some point in time. Occasionally, Weepinbell may fall from their trees in their sleep. This is a huge danger for these Pokémon, as they become vulnerable to predators (and to capture by humans) in this state. However, in a colony, a fallen Weepinbell is still extremely dangerous to approach, as the other Weepinbell still hanging from the tree will be ready to attack with sprays of acid.","Victreebel live in huge colonies in the middle of dense tropical rainforests, a fact that was recently discovered (all expeditions in the past had failed, with their crews having all mysteriously disappeared). Their acid is strong enough to melt nearly anything. To hunt, Victreebel flail the vines attached to their heads around like lures, attracting unwary prey towards them. Then, their acid, which smells like honey, brings their targets right to the Pokémon. Victreebel then swallow their victims whole, digesting them with their powerful acids. As they dissolve more prey, their ​acid’s smell grows even sweeter and more honey-like, attracting more prey and continuing the cycle.  As stone-evolved Pokémon, Victreebel are rather rare in the wild and are generally only found in the previously-mentioned colonies, rarely straying into the fringes of their forests. Weepinbell who do manage to come into contact with Leaf Stones in the wild almost instinctively hone in on and join the closest Victreebel colonies in their vicinities.","Tentacool are very common Pokémon in seas worldwide, found in the waters of Kanto, Johto, Hoenn, Sinnoh, Kalos, and Alola. They are especially prolific in areas where warm and cold currents meet, bringing an abundance of food and minerals. They can often be found drifting with the waves in shallow waters, stinging anything that provokes them with their tentacles. They also uses these tentacles to feel about; however, they are unable to retract their stinging cells, so they often unintentionally sting things they are examining. These tentacles sometimes break off, but will grow back with time. As their bodies are 99% composed water, they will quickly dry out and shrivel up if washed ashore; the other 1% percent is their venom-producing organ. They can be revived by being tossed back into the sea. Their high water content also gives them a rather peculiar ability--Tentacool can refract sunlight and concentrate it into the crystals on their heads to fire strange beams of energy at foes. Though they are a common catch for anglers, beginners must be wary of their venom. Even an unconscious Tentacool can sting those foolish enough to touch their tentacles.","Tentacruel have 80 tentacles in total and are said to be able to capture 80 prey at once, one in each. While this has never been seen in the wild, trained ones have been recorded achieving this feat. Normally, Tentacruel keep their tentacles short. However, when hunting, the tentacles absorb water and extend to ensnare prey. They form circular nets around prey to prevent their escape. Then, they constrict their victims, stinging and weakening them by injecting venom. Tentacruel then return back to the rock formations on the sea floor that they call home, carrying their meals with them. If a Tentacruel is having a particularly rough time finding something to eat, its orbs will flash. These Pokémon can emit ultrasonic blasts from their crystals to disturb the surrounding water and scare out prey. Additionally, they can also flash these crystals to alert surrounding Tentacruel of approaching danger. When conditions are right, many Tentacruel will suddenly congregate and clear an area of all fish. Their tentacles do not regrow, so older individuals tend to have fewer of them.","Geodude are extremely common Pokémon in rocky places, sometimes representing nearly half of the total Pokémon in the area. They can almost perfectly disguise themselves as normal stones and hide in plain sight, spending most of their time like this. Geodude bury themselves halfway into the dirt to sleep; if stepped on, they may not even stir. However, awakening a sleeping Geodude may anger it and cause it to swing its fists at the assailer. They roll down mountainsides in search of food. Once satisfied, they hoist themselves back up with their arms in slow ascents. As Geodude age, their rough bodies begin to smoothen as their daily rolls chip away at their exteriors. The oldest Geodude may even have completely smooth bodies; such individuals tend to be calmer and less ornery than their younger relatives as well. They are prideful of the toughness of their bodies; two Geodude will slam against each other to see which has the harder exterior. They are occasionally thrown about by other mountain Pokémon such as Machop when mistaken for rocks, but their sturdy bodies can handle the roughhousing. In snowy weather, some people even mistake sleeping, snow-covered Geodude for snowballs.","Though Graveler are carefree and not at all aggressive Pokémon, they are one of the main dangers trainers face while hiking in the mountains. The main hazard with Graveler is that they roll down mountainsides carelessly (as they are very slow walkers), smashing trees, boulders, and anything else standing in the way--including unwary travelers--until they reach the bottom. If they land into a river, they may even explode upon contact. They are very difficult to stop once they pick up momentum from their tumbles, and can appear almost out of nowhere due to the high speeds they can reach. The best way to avoid rolling Graveler is to stay alert. If one hears rumbling in the distance on a mountain, one should try to locate its source and steer clear of the direct line below it. Graveler actively enjoy rolling down mountains and will climb to their peaks simply to tumble back down. Sometimes, these Pokémon may lose chunks of their bodies due to the rough terrains they roll on (though they do slowly regenerate); the broken chunks may fly off as debris, so one must make sure to take cover as well. When not rolling down mountains, Graveler consume rocks, especially enjoying those covered in moss.","Golem are rarities in the wild, so (luckily) it is rare to see one tumbling down a mountainside. They are still very dangerous to be near, though, because they often use Explosion to propel themselves from mountain to mountain. Such explosions can set off rockslides in the immediate vicinity. Their hides are strong enough to withstand dynamite blasts. Golem shed their skins annually to grow larger; their shells almost immediately crumble away into the soil, enriching it. Farmers strive to collect shed Golem pelts as a result. Their bodies are whitish and tender for a short period of time, but new shells will quickly harden upon contact with the air. However, Golem eventually stop shedding with age, and particularly old individuals may even start growing moss on their carapaces after some time. Earthquakes will sometimes send groups of Golem rolling down, endangering alpine homes. To protect these structures, grooves are often dug in the sides of mountains to redirect the paths of spooked Golem (and careless Graveler as well). When Golem roll, they tuck in their limbs and heads, rendering them temporarily unable to see. A rolling Golem may cause a small earthquake due to its weight, triggering others to roll as well.","Ponyta are born as weak runners, unable to take more than a few steps without stumbling. However, as they gallops along with their parents and jump over tall grass, their legs gradually becomes stronger. Eventually, they becomes one of the best jumpers in the world, able to clear nearly 3,000 feet (1 kilometer) in a single bound. Their hooves are harder than diamond, allowing them to flatten practically anything they trample over. These sturdy hooves absorb the impact from their enormous jumps. Ponyta are born flameless, but their fire emerges as soon as an hour after ​birth. They defend themselves using both their hooves and their flames, rearing their legs to kick targets behind them and attacking those in front with moves like Flame Wheel. Ponyta can only be ridden by those that they trust; if strangers attempt to mount them, they can burn them with fire. Curiously, their flames never dissipate. Though Ponyta can control the temperatures of their flames, they cannot make them disappear. This odd ability is currently the subject of intensive study.","Rapidash spend most of their time cantering leisurely through plains. However, they love running, and can of reaching speeds rivaling that of bullet trains at 150 mph (240 km/h); their feet barely even touch the ground when sprinting. Rapidash greatly enjoy being challenged. When they sees anything moving quickly, even man-made objects like trains and cars, they will race alongside it and attempt to out-speed it. They can reach their top speeds in as little as ten steps, appearing as blazing trails of fire to onlookers. These flames flare up and become larger the faster Rapidash run. At full speed, their manes appear to sparkle. Like their pre-evolutions, their flames only burn those that they distrust or are angered by. However, many people prefer riding Rapidash over Ponyta because they are less skittish when faced with unexpected obstacles. Rapidash can use their horns, in addition to their Fire-type attacks and powerful hooves, to defend themselves with moves such as Megahorn. However, they are not aggressive and will only charge if they feel threatened. The fastest Rapidash in a herd is the de-facto leader, setting the pace and direction for the others.","Slowpoke truly live up to the title “the Dopey Pokémon.” They are rather dim and slow; in fact, it can take them over 5 seconds to react to pain. To catch food, Slowpoke dangle their tails lazily from the shore into the sea. They secrete a sweet substance that attracts fish. However, due to their daftness, they sometimes forget why they were even near the water in the first place. It can take them up to a day to process bites on their tails. Slowpoke tails are regarded to be very delicious. They shed and regrow their tails periodically; the shed appendages are harvested and dried for cooking. Cutting the tails of live Slowpoke is strictly forbidden and can be punished severely. Some believe fresh tails are more potent, though, and they are sadly a common product on the black market. Slowpoke Well in Azalea Town, Johto is a man-made well that many Slowpoke call home. Residents keep them as local pets of sorts. They believe that a Slowpoke’s yawn ended a huge drought many years ago and respect the Pokémon greatly out of gratitude.","While fishing, wild Slowpoke may eventually catch Shellder on their tails. If they are sufficiently grown, these catches will catalyze their evolutions into Slowbro. The Shellder attached to Slowbro grow with them as well, taking on spiral shapes. The added weight force Slowbro to become bipedal. Shellder poison also completely numbs their pain receptors.  These Shellder almost parasitize Slowbro, drawing energy from their delicious tails and feeding on leftover scraps. Because they will not come off in any way (save from being thrown off in particularly rough battles, at ​which point the Slowbro will resume life as larger Slowpoke), Slowbro are no longer able to fish with their tails and must, to their disdain, swim to catch food. They retain their dim intellects even after evolution. However, on occasions, the Shellder may bite down and send more poison into their hosts’ brains, and as a strange result, cause them to become briefly enlightened; their Psychic-type attacks will be strengthened as well when this occurs.","Though Magnemite look like artificial beings, they have actually been around for over 1,000 years, as ancient carvings depicting them have been found in the Ruins of Alph. Magnemite float using electromagnetic energy, which they generate by spinning the units on their sides; the faster they rotate, the more energy they generate. Touching them as they spin can give a nasty shock. They cannot float without this spinning—if somehow drained of their electrical energy, they will fall straight to the ground. Magnemite tend to ignore humans, but are attracted to electronic devices because they feed on electricity. As a result they often congregate around trainers using Pokédexes or other devices, potentially causing them to malfunction. They also may cling to power lines and towers in urban areas, causing small power outages. Some studies show that Magnemite attacks on power plants have become more frequent in the last 50 years, possibly because an increase in buried power-lines have forced them to find more exposed electrical sources. For this reason, modern power plants may pulse deterrent electrical signals to keep them at bay. Magnemite generally defend themselves with non-damaging attacks like Thunder Wave and Metal Sound. They will not hesitate, however, to use other moves such as Thunderbolt and Magnet Bomb if necessary.","When three wild Magnemite come together, their magnetic forces may attract them and trigger their evolution into a Magneton (a lone, trained Magnemite does not need others to evolve; they seem to mysteriously duplicate themselves twice for evolution). Their brains fuse in this process, though contrary to popular belief, they do not become three times smarter. Magneton generate radio waves that can raise heat the air within 3,300 feet (1,000 meters) by 3.6°F (2°C), dry all surrounding moisture, and cause earaches in those nearby. They seem to appear more frequently when there are more sunspots on the sun, a correlation that researchers have not found an explanation for. Magneton can irreparably damage electronics simply by being near them. For that reason, many cities near their habitats will issue warnings or sound alarms when swarms of them approach (luckily, their relationship with sunspots make them easy to predict). They will also congregate in areas where lighting is about to strike in hopes of being hit. In battle, Magneton are unusually receptive to commands and never disobey orders.","Farfetch’d are almost never seen without their leeks. They use them to do almost everything, from defending themselves against predators to building their nests, and most likely cannot survive without them. They protect the fields in which these plants grow with their lives, and will often fight with each other for choice stalks. Their wings have adapted to be more finger-like to enable them to grasp leeks, though some prefer hold them in their beaks instead. Farfetch’d are extremely endangered, as they are said to be very delicious, especially cooked with the very stalks they hold. Because of this, there are large efforts to breed these Pokémon to prevent them from going extinct. In dire emergencies, Farfetch’d may actually eat their own leeks. They will begin search endlessly for new ones immediately afterwards, however. Their stalks enable them to use moves such as Night Slash, False Swipe, and Aerial Ace; different fighting styles have been observed in different regions. Farfetch’d are surprisingly adept in water, thanks to their webbed feet, and can sometimes be found swimming in ponds.","Despite being Flying-types, Doduo are very poor fliers, barely able to stay aloft at all. Instead, they choose running as their preferred method of travel, and are capable of reaching speeds of up to 60 mph (100 km/h) on flat surfaces (which are abundant in the plains and savannas they call home). While sprinting, they may leave footprints in the dirt as deep as 4 inches (10 centimeters). Doduo alternately bob their heads to keep balance while running. Their two heads have identical brains (though a few with differing ones have been discovered on occasion) and can communicate ​with each other through telepathy in order to accomplish common goals. The two heads take turns sleeping; while one dozes off, the other keeps watch for any potential dangers approaching. This team effort makes it difficult to catch Doduo off-guard. To defend themselves, Doduo can attack with moves such as Double Hit and Drill Peck. They are able to use both heads at once for some moves, effectively being able to target two enemies at the same time if necessary.","When a Doduo evolves into a Dodrio, it grows a third head and its brains begin to differentiate. Each head controls a different basic emotion; one expresses joy, one sadness, and one anger. Dodrio also have three sets of hearts and lungs, allowing them to tirelessly run long distances. They can jump extremely well to make up for their poor flying abilities. They can also use their three heads to conceive complex plans to search for food or defend themselves. However, they may occasionally over-exhaust themselves with this, and will remain motionless for extended periods of time while recovering. Their heads do argue sometimes, since the emotions they control tend to disagree. However, like many internal conflicts, these inner spats are usually solved with food. Since they share the same stomach, when one of the heads eats, the other two will be satisfied as well. Those who live near Dodrio may be woken up early in the morning by their raucous calls-- they squawk at the same time every day without fail.","Seel prefer to swim in oceans with waters of temperatures around 14°F (-10°C). However, they have been seen merrily swimming in water as cold as -40°F (-40°C). Seel are actually more active the colder the surrounding water is. Conversely, they get tired more easily in warm waters; this makes their appearance in the Alola region a mystery, though some scientists hypothesize that the islands may be along a Seel migration route. Their light-blue fur (which appears white) and layers of blubber insulate them from the harsh cold. Seel are vespertine Pokémon that are most active in the evening. Sometimes, one may see a Seel napping near the shoreline in the morning. When hunting, they dive underwater for extended periods of time. When they need to breathe, they surface and break through sea ice with their horns (and tusks if necessary). When Seel swim, they close their nostrils tightly to block out water. They are highly social Pokémon, living in large, raucous groups on ice floes in the middle of the sea. Seel may play-fight with each other on these floes, sparring with their tusks and horns as well as Water-type and sometimes Ice-type attacks. This activity is important in teaching young Seel how to defend themselves against enemies.","Like Seel, Dewgong prefer frigid waters. They can swim at a steady 8 knots, undeterred by the cooler temperatures around them. In fact, like their pre-evolutions, Dewgong become more active in colder waters. When resting, though they do still sometimes sleep on the ocean floor or shore like Seel, they now prefer to rest on ice floes. Recent studies show that they are in fact sunbathing while doing so, with the increased temperature aiding their digestion. There, their pristine white fur can camouflage them against predators. It is believed that these sleeping Dewgong were the source of myths about mermaids, perpetrated by tired sailors on the cold seas. Dewgong are only slightly more adept on land than Seel, and as such still prefer to stay in the water. Their bodies are streamlined to minimize drag while swimming, and their long tails enable them to turn on a dime. Their fur and blubber can store thermal energy, insulating them against the bitter cold. Dewgong no longer use their tusks and horns to play-fight, since they stop growing at this stage. However, they are still useful for poking breathing holes into ice floes while swimming under them to resurface for air.","There is a popular myth circulating about how Grimer were born from industrial waste being exposed to X-rays radiated from the moon. It is far more likely, though, that they emerged from polluted waterways filled with radioactive industrial waste. In a freak accident of nature, Grimer emerged, breeding and multiplying quickly. Grimer feed on toxic sludge and can squeeze their gel-like bodies through almost any opening to get to it, often infiltrating sewage pipes and occasionally clogging them up if present in larger numbers. Their putrid smell is indicative of cities with polluted waterways; Celadon City, Kanto, for example, is home to reports of Grimer splashing about in public fountains. Wherever Grimer go, their toxins kill flora upon contact and prevent anything else from growing there. Additionally, they can reproduce in the wild asexually; bits of them may drip off as they travel to form new Grimer. Grimer will die if their bacterial sludge is purified; new urban sanitation methods have recently decreased their numbers.","Muk are living embodiments of liquid waste.  A single drop from one can pollute an entire lake. They prefer warm and humid places, but they can thrive anywhere that is near polluted water. Muk smell so rancid that plants near them will wilt. Luckily for them, their noses have degenerated, so they are unable to smell themselves. Their stenches worsen in hot summers (though a select few seem to enjoy the odor). Muk trails are inhospitable to life and kill plants on contact. They can transmit many infectious (but luckily, rarely fatal) diseases if touched. Muk are less dense than water, so lakes with many of them may appear to be covered in sludge. Thankfully, Muk learn to control their poisons after evolving and can peacefully coexist with others (who can tolerate their smell). They will unleash their toxins on those who threaten their young, who they are fiercely protective of. Because they require pollution to survive, some scientists believe that environmental efforts may one day lead to their extinction; some organizations have implemented sludge pools in order to provide these Pokémon with suitable habitats to thrive in.","Shellder live on the sea floor, digging holes with their tongues and hiding in them with their tongues out to catch prey. Their tongues are never withdrawn, even when sleeping. Yanking on them will cause them to open up in shock. Shellder can move surprisingly quickly by flapping their shells. They can also lampoon prey with Icicle Spear. While their shells are harder than diamond, their insides are very delicate. Coastal tribes once used their shells to fashion shields. They can inject a numbing poison by clamping down on foes, but they leave their heads vulnerable when doing so. Shellder can form beautiful pearls from sand trapped in their shells, which can be sold for large sums of money; some people raise Shellder solely for this reason. Because these pearls obstruct their vision and feeding, these Pokémon conveniently will spit them out once formed. Shellder enjoy eating Slowpoke tail secretions and will bite these tails on sight. They then adopt a spiral shape and inject poison as the Slowpoke evolve into Slowbro. They are also oddly attracted to King’s Rocks. If a Slowpoke is wearing one, a Shellder may propel itself into the air to bite its head, triggering its evolution into a Slowking.","Cloyster shells are even harder than diamond, able to withstand bomb explosions; the spikes they shoot to defend themselves and hunt are even harder. Coastal tribes once used discarded spikes to tip their spears. To catch food, Cloyster wait on the ocean floor for prey swim by before shooting these spikes by using the move Spike Cannon. The harpooned prey then slowly float down to the waiting Cloyster. Like Shellder, Cloyster love Slowpoke tails, and may even venture onto land to seek them out. Cloyster are capable of swimming by swallowing water and jetting it out—this is the same process they use to shoot spikes. They can slam their shells shut with incredible force. Unlike Shellder, Cloyster can use clamping as a viable method of defense. Their insides are virtually untouchable while their shells are closed. Even the strongest forces cannot pry a clamped Cloyster apart; consequently, no one knows exactly what lies within their shells. It has been recently discovered that Cloyster that live in stronger currents have larger spikes, though the reason behind this is unknown. A concurrent study found that when a Cloyster shell is damaged, a new spike grows in place of the damaged area instead of recovering the flat surface.","Gastly are amorphous Pokémon with no definite shape. Their bodies consist of nearly 95% gas; in folklore, the other 5% is the souls of those who died in the gas. Another legend purports that Gastly form from gas in graveyards being possessed by the restless spirits of the dead. Their gaseous bodies enable them to slip through tiny cracks. However, they also allow them to be blown away by strong winds. To protect themselves, Gastly hide in abandoned buildings or under the eaves of houses. They capture prey by enveloping them in their poisonous gas, which can seep through skin and cause fainting. They may also immobilize prey with the paralyzing move Lick. Despite their poor reputation, though, Gastly are not blatantly malicious and do not “haunt” beings with the intent of harming them. Instead, they are mischievous pranksters who enjoy startling others. They rarely utilize their poisonous gases unless threatened, but are known to put victims to sleep with Hypnosis. Their pranks can be annoying at times, so it should be noted that oscillating fans are very effective at warding Gastly away because the Pokémon steer clear of strong winds. When Gastly are near, it is said the air will smell faintly sweet.","Haunter are able to phase through solid objects, like walls. They feed on the life force of living things, waiting in the darkness for unwary prey to wander by. Then, they sneak up on their victims and lick them. This causes uncontrollable shuddering in their prey, who are slowly drained of life until they die. Like Gastly, Haunter are also pranksters. They may trip unwary travelers or place ghostly hands on their shoulders to scare them. When a Haunter is around, those nearby feel paranoid, as if they are being watched (which they are). Haunter can also feed on fear. Though research has shown that such a diet is not very energy-efficient, it is believed that some Haunter have learned to feed on these feelings because they are “sustainable;” by not killing victims, some Haunter have successfully used cities as “farms” of sorts, scaring people as necessary and feeding on their fright. Many ghost “hot-spots” are in fact popular Haunter feeding grounds. Since Haunter detest light, well-lit towns are usually devoid of them. In some regions is said that Haunter come out on moonless nights looking for victims to lay curses on.","Gengar draw heat from others; when one is near, those around it can feel chills as the temperature drops by nearly 10°F (5°C). They may even try to lay curses on those who walk alone near them. Gengar are most active during full moons, creeping out in the dead of night and disguising themselves as shadows; they may even enters sleeping homes to lurk in the dark. They will mimic every movement their targets make until they lower their guards. Then, they strike, draining their life force as sustenance. Gengar are also said to attack those who are hopelessly lost and afraid in the mountains. Many Gengar have learned to feed on fear, simply following victims in the shadows and mimicking them almost, but not quite perfectly. This cultivates great paranoia in victims, which they can then feast on. Other tricks Gengar have been known to use include: laughing maniacally in the shadows, lighting their red eyes in the darkness, and chanting mysteriously in the distance. In some places, parents warn that Gengar appear at night in the bedrooms of naughty children. A famous folk tale tells of a Gengar that once used to be human, attacking people so it could have a friend.","Onix spend most of their time burrowing through the earth, twisting and turning their massive bodies as they dig. They constantly eat while burrowing, consuming boulders, dirt, and whatever else they come across. These tunnels often later become homes and pathways for other subterranean Pokémon, such as Diglett and Druddigon. They can dig at speeds up to 50 mph (80 km/h), and their roars can cause rumblings above that can be mistaken for earthquakes. Onix can regrow parts of their bodies if damaged, taking anywhere from a few days to a few weeks depending on the severity of their wounds. They also can rotate any of their rocky segments, including their heads, 360°. Their heads also contain magnetic components that function like compasses, ensuring that they never get lost while burrowing underground. As they dig, the great pressure of the earth and the roughness of the substrate they burrow in can smoothen and slowly compress parts of their bodies into a black, diamond-like material--onyx.","Drowzee are said to have descended from mythical dream-eating spirits called baku. While the statement is likely a myth, Drowzee do share quite a few similarities with these spirits. Like baku, Drowzee consume dreams--especially those of young children and Pokémon, as they are said to be tastier than those of adults. For this reason, they can sometimes be found lurking outside daycares or kindergartens during naptime. They are also skilled in hypnotism, putting people and Pokémon to sleep to consume their dreams. There are many “signs” people believe Drowzee leave after eating dreams. For example, an itchy nose upon waking may mean one has sucked up a dream through your nostrils, or having a good dream but not remembering it means that it has been consumed. Drowzee (save for trained ones) rarely live near people, however, preferring to feed on the dreams of Pokémon in the grasslands that they call home. They get sick from bad dreams (which are said to taste sour), so they uses their noses to differentiate between good dreams and nightmares. Trained Drowzee can show people their dreams upon awakening. ","Just the mention of Hypno will strike fear in any parent’s heart. Tales of Hypno hypnotizing and kidnapping children run rampant. One particular story that made headlines was that of the young girl Lostelle, who was hypnotized by a Hypno and taken to Berry Forest on Kin Island in the Sevii Islands, where the Pokémon proceeded to feast on her dreams. It took a daring young trainer to defeat the Hypno and rescue her. Luckily, Hypno only prey on dreams, so captives generally return physically unharmed. Their swinging pendulums cause drowsiness even in onlookers that have just awoken. The longer one stares at the mesmerizing oscillations, the longer the effect last. Hypno polish their pendulums constantly with their manes. Many parents warn their children to shut their eyes or look away if they run into Hypno; however, this is more easily said than done. The swinging of a Hypno’s pendulum transfixes all that see it. As a result, it oftentimes takes an outside force, such as another person, to push victims away. However, trained Hypno are of great use to doctors to help treat insomnia in patients. Oddly, in the Alola region, wild Hypno rarely attack humans because of the presence of the permanently-sleeping Komala as much easier targets.","Krabby dwell on sandy beaches and in muddy estuaries, digging into the sand so that they are not washed away by the waves. They are scavengers, feeding on whatever the tides bring in. If food is scarce, they may even eat sand to obtain nutrients. This can lead to fierce fights between Krabby over land, battling with moves like Vice Grip and Crabhammer. If their claws break off during battle, they can regrow stronger ones to replace them. They use their claws to balance while walking sideways, so they cannot move properly when missing one. Krabby are hardy Pokémon that can live near water of various salinities and pollution levels. They grow by molting their exoskeletons. By absorbing seawater and expanding themselves slightly, they loosen their old shells and cast them off. It takes a few days for their new shell to harden. During these periods, they will hide in their burrows to protect themselves. Krabby can spew foam from their mouths when threatened to cover their bodies and make themselves appear larger.","The defining characteristic of Kingler is how one of their claws is significantly larger than the other. These “super-claws” are as hard as iron, but unfortunately are just as heavy. They can exert crushing forces of 10,000 horsepower, but due to their weights, are extremely unwieldy to use in battle. If Kingler attempt to move them too quickly, they may lose balance and stumble. However, due to their sheer power, only a single blow needs to connect to defeat most foes. Out of battle, these large claw aren’t very efficient for most everyday tasks, so they tends to use their smaller ones instead. When signaling to fellow Kingler or competing for dominance, however, they will wave their larger claws wildly in the air (a very tiring action for them). In battle, Kingler use their massive claws to execute Vice Grip, Crabhammer, and even Guillotine. While their armor are steel-hard, though, their exoskeletons do have a chink, which can be revealed by flipping them over onto their backs. This “weak spot” can be attacked to easily defeat them.","Voltorb are mysterious Pokémon, first appearing with the advent of mass-producing Poké Ball factories. They rather uncannily resembles large Poké Balls themselves. Many trainers have mistaken Voltorb or their evolutions Electrode for them from afar. However, Voltorb are prone to screeching, shocking or exploding at the slightest provocation, especially when someone draws too near. Their preferred form of locomotion is rolling, but if they hit bumps, they will also explode. Voltorb draw energy from sources of electricity, such as the trolleys of electric trains or generators. However, if they draw too much energy at once, they will overload and, unsurprisingly, blow up. These volatile Pokémon have been discovered to contain very few naturally-occurring components, leading scientists to believe that they may have stemmed from sort of manmade experiment involving Poké Balls. Something may have went wrong during the experiment, explaining their tendencies to self-destruct so easily.","When Voltorb evolve into Electrode, their explosive tendencies only intensify. Electrode store high amounts of electrical energy within themselves, and like Voltorb, will let it out in huge explosions at the slightest provocation--only an Electrode’s blast is much larger and more powerful. They feed on electrical energy in the atmosphere or directly from generators. Groups of them at power plants have been known to cause blackouts. Sometimes, if they bloat themselves on electricity, they will drift through the air like floating, explosive balloons. When lightning strikes, a large number ​of them may detonate at once from the overload of electricity. These Pokémon don’t always even need stimuli; sometimes, bored Electrode may explode just to amuse themselves. “Bomb Balls,” as they are nicknamed (for obvious reasons) can also generate their own electricity to provide power. As long as the equipment is shielded and the Electrode are not bothered, this is a useful way for them to release some of their excess energy.","While they may superficially resemble eggs, Exeggcute are actually more like seeds. They always must be in groups of 6 to maintain balance; lone Exeggcute will quickly be joined by five others almost immediately. They can communicate with each other telepathically. If one member of a pack is threatened, the others will swarm the attacker to defend it. They use their psychic abilities to fend from predators like Crabrawler. Some of their shells may crack as they travel. However, they are surprisingly durable Pokémon that can survive with cracked or broken shells with little problem. In fact, as these Pokémon approach evolution, these cracks become more and more common. These groups of a half-dozen each are considered one Pokémon—they all can be caught in one Poké Ball, count as one Pokémon in battle, and so forth, in part due to their “shared” minds. Since they get distressed if they are unable to have six members, it is considered abuse to force Exeggcute in groups of more or less. Exeggcute in the Alola region are much heavier for their size, likely because they are stuffed with nutrients.","When exposed to Leaf Stones, groups of Exeggcute (as always, there must be in half-dozens) will evolve into Exeggutor. These Pokémon live in large herds. When they migrate, it appears as if entire forests are uprooting and moving themselves. This gives them the nickname “The Walking Forests”. Their three heads each speak their minds all at once. As a result, Exeggutor can be very noisy at times. They use telepathy to plan amongst themselves before acting. They are very friendly, both between their heads and to others, so it is rare for them to ever argue. When they do, however, Exeggutor will become confused, especially if they try to move in different directions at once. On occasion, ahead of an Exeggutor may fall off. When this occurs, it becomes an Exeggcute and will emit a telepathic call almost immediately to attract five other Exeggcute and become a group. Though not aggressive, Exeggutor are capable of defending themselves when attacked with a variety of moves, including techniques such as Egg Bomb and the rare Barrage. Focusing on the same target with all three ends results in a triple-strength attack. They are rarely threatened, though, as their herds give them strength in numbers; few ever want to anger entire “forests.”","Cubone and their evolutions Marowak have a very complex social structure, revolving primarily around solitude, worth, and bones. In a tribe of Marowak, the bones of ancestors are kept and treasured as heirlooms, passed on through generations. When born, Cubone do not see their mothers, as they are abandoned in the wild. They are born with closed eyes far away from their tribes, with only a bone (usually a femur) and a skull to protect themselves. They then simply wander aimlessly, wearing the skulls as helmets and using the bones as weapons. It is commonly believed that these bones are the remains of the their mothers, though this is not always true. Most Cubone are traumatized by abandonment, crying mournfully into their skulls to create a rattling sound (which can attract preying Mandibuzz). They often look up on nights of full moons and cry. They are antisocial Pokémon; since they are so isolated, they do not know how to interact with others. It is said that Cubone evolve when they learn to embrace their loneliness.","Upon evolution, Marowak no longer grieve about abandonment; instead, their traumatic pasts become fuel for ruthless combat. They use bones to defeat foes with moves like Bone Club and Bonemerang. Marowak possess homing instincts that lead them back to to their mothers’ tribes. They will join these tribes, never learning who their mothers truly were. Their loneliness has hardened them towards all deep social connections. Marowak will often fight one another in these tribes to the death for especially prized bones. The loser’s remains will supply tools for future Cubone. The abandonment of young is a coming-of-age for Marowak. Lone Cubone, though traumatized, return home as cold, ruthless fighters who have no qualms whatsoever about brutally beating or killing others. Marowak hardly even communicate with each other, and even more rarely do so with speech. They tap their bones on boulders in specific rhythms to send messages. There are known to be over 50 of these unique rhythms. These Pokémon despise Mandibuzz, who try to steal their prized bones, and will throw their bones at them to knock them out of the sky. In popular folklore where Cubone are believed to be wearing the skulls of their mothers, Marowak are spurred on to defend their bones by their desire to avenge their deceased parent.","Also known by the monikers “The Kicking Masters,” Hitmonlee and their relatives Hitmonchan and Hitmontop are found in cites, training peacefully alongside humans. They also occasionally head to mountains to train, though they generally return back to urban areas at night. Their legs are like springs, flexible and capable of stretching. They can extend great distances outward to surprise foes with their long ranges. When Hitmonlee kick, their soles become harder than diamond upon impact. They have a great sense of balance; in combination with their incredibly limber legs, They can kick foes successively and powerfully from any position. Their legs also allow them to run smoothly, lengthening and progressively increasing the distance covered by their strides as they sprint. After tough training sessions, Hitmonlee will often massage their legs to prevent fatigue. They can often be found in dojos, teaching people how to deliver devastating kicks as well as learning new, unorthodox techniques from them. ","A Hitmonchan’s punches are as fast as lightning, nearly invisible to the naked eye. Hitmonchan may appear to be standing idly when in fact launching volleys of punches faster than bullet trains into thin air as practice. However, these punches do tire them out--after three minutes of intense work, they need to take light rests. However, Hitmonchan are determined, having the spirit of champion boxers, and will not give up no matter what. Even during these breaks, Hitmonchan will often move around or jog quickly in place. They punch in a corkscrew fashion, with enough ​force to pulverize concrete. Even slight grazes from their blows can cause mild burns. They are also skilled in sparring with light punches, allowing them to act as a sparring partners to fellow Hitmonchan or to aspiring human boxers (the latter of which who almost always lose, but learn from fights nonetheless). Like Hitmonlee, Hitmonchan can be found training in dojos, but can also sometimes be seen punching away at boulders in mountains.","Lickitung are known for their large tongues, which can be extended up 6 and a half feet (198 centimeters) outwards. They have well-developed muscles and nerves running down their tongues, allowing them to manipulate them freely to use as “feelers” of sorts. Their tongues are actually the most receptive part of their bodies, even more sensitive than their hands. When they come across unfamiliar objects, they will lick them, as they associate things by texture and taste. Lickitung do not enjoy sourness, however, and will avoid things that are tart. When their tongues extend, their tails retract; the two organs are connected by a single muscle system. Lickitung saliva causes a tingling sensation upon contact. When threatened, Lickitung can also secrete a substance that mixes with their sticky saliva and paralyzes upon contact. This substance also causes people to break out into a rash if not quickly cleaned. Though Lickitung often chase down people and Pokémon, they are not aggressive. In addition to using their tongues to feel new things, they also use them to detect food particles on others and lick them off to \"clean\" them, though this always leaves a rather unpleasant order behind.","Koffing live in smog-heavy areas, such as in highly polluted urban cities and above active volcanoes. They contain dozens of different poisonous fumes inside their bodies. Their skin is very thin, even transparent in certain lighting. In warmer climates, such as near volcanoes, the gases in their bodies can expand, stretching their skin and making them prone to exploding. Koffing also tend to produce more gas when warm, making detonations all the more likely. Their gaseous mixtures are lighter than air, allowing them to float. Koffing can also expel these gases when threatened, inducing teary eyes, stuffy noses, and coughing in those exposed to even the most minute amounts. They can also poison attackers with Poison Gas, and of course, use Explosion as well. The gases Koffing expel become smellier and more toxic when they are stressed. Their explosive tendencies essentially make them dangerous, floating mines. In cities where they are plentiful, Koffing can create dangerous smog that shrouds the metropolises. Some regions however, notably Galar, have taken measures in past centuries in order to limit Koffing populations for this reason.","Koffing can evolve into Weezing normally as they develop. However, in the wild, two Koffing can merge together where two different toxic gases meet --a rare occurrence--into a Weezing (in a few cases, triplets have even formed). Each of their heads contains a different poisonous gas. By inflating their heads in an alternating manner, they mix their gases together to form stinkier, more dangerous compounds. They can also worsen the smell and toxicity of their gases by inhaling fumes from industrial waste or absorbing the dust, gases, and germs from garbage. Weezing will make ​their homes in dirty houses, hiding in attics until the residents leave or fall asleep, at which point they will emerge to feast on their garbage. They also make their homes near factories with large amounts of industrial waste or near the toxic gases above active volcanoes. Though the stench from a thriving Weezing can knock a person out, by diluting it to nearly imperceptible amounts, some companies have been able to create a top-grade perfume.","While powerful, Rhyhorn are not the smartest Pokémon in the world. Their bones are 1,000 times harder than those of humans and their tackles can send trailers flying or topple buildings. However, they are said to only be able to remember one thing at a time. While that is not true, they are still rather dense Pokémon. They will often charge at something but forget why they began charging in the first place mid-run; they will not stop running until they tire out and collapse from exhaustion, however. Sometimes, destroying things help Rhyhorn remember why they began running. Their short feet make it difficult for them to turn, so they can only run in straight lines. Thus, they tend to be very easy to dodge. Oftentimes, they will not even register pain from their collisions until the next day. Though wild Rhyhorn can be very aggressive, trained ones are known to be very affectionate and protective of their trainers. They will gladly allow their trainers to ride on their backs; in some regions, Rhyhorn racing is a popular sport.","Upon evolution, Rhydon become bipedal much more intelligent than their pre-evolutions. Though still forgetful, their brains have developed enough to be able to process information and apply it in problem-solving. Their armor allows them to withstand magma of temperatures up to 3,600°F (2,000°C), which is abundant in the deep caverns some of them live in. Their drill-like horns can bore through boulders and even solid diamond, and sweeps from their tails can destroy buildings. Rhydon armor can withstand nearly anything, including forces as strong as cannon blasts. However, their armor also renders them insensitive to most physical sensations, including pain, as a result. Consequently, they will often unwittingly injure themselves. Notably, though their near-impervious armor does not protect them from water, its thickness prevents their pain receptors from activating in response to getting wet until the Pokémon are already drenched. Rhydon tend to live in hot, dry areas because of this.","Chansey are rare Pokémon whose eggs are greatly sought after, both because they have medicinal properties as well as because they are delicious. Chansey lay eggs every day and always carry one in their pouches. If they come across injured Pokémon or people, they will share their eggs with them and nurse them back to health. Because of their amazing abilities to heal Pokémon, it is most common to see Chansey working in Pokémon Centers. Chansey treated with affection are said to lay more nutritious and tasty eggs. Their eggs are believed to bring happiness to consumers and restore the appetites of those who lost them in sickness. Though very kind and generous, Chansey will refuse to share their eggs with those with pure malice in their hearts. They are forgiving, however, and will gladly share with those who prove that they have changed their ways. Catching these elusive Pokémon is said to grant eternal happiness. Chansey normally walk slowly to protect their eggs, but can dash surprisingly quickly when spooked. Chansey are endangered due to past overharvesting of their eggs; some scientists even believe that modern Chansey have evolved to be even faster at fleeing due to this selective pressure.","A Tangela’s vines never stop moving. Though they are genetically closely related to seaweed, they do not require any more water than the average plant. Their vines never stop growing and can regenerate. This allows Tangela to snap off vines painlessly to distract predators and regrow them later as soon as the next day. The swaying of their vines can be mysteriously unnerving to onlookers.  Their vines are covered in fine hairs that tickle those caught within and also allow Tangela to use their vines as arms; the hairs can “feel” objects when brushed against them and detect ​changes in air pressure and humidity. What lies within a Tangela’s mass of vines is a mystery, as no one has managed to uncover them. Tangela fiercely resist any attempt to remove their vines. Their vines latch onto anything that moves. If Tangela grab foes that turn out to be too strong, their vines will break off and allow them to escape. Otherwise, they will take down their opponents with moves like Constrict, Vine Whip, and Power Whip.","Kangaskhan carry their young in stomach pouches. A Kangaskhan will keep its child in its pouch until it is three years old, at which point it will be able to hunt for itself. In the meantime, Kangaskhan are very protective of their babies, attacking anyone who they believe may be endangering them with moves like Comet Punch. They will give their lives for their children; it is said that the only time they cry is when their children leave for good. Kangaskhan will only let their young out of their pouches to play when they are certain there are no dangers around. Baby Kangaskhan arenever alone, though, even when playing; their mothers will keep close watch of them from behind trees. Drawing too close to a playing infant Kangaskhan will spur its mother to defend it. When mother Kangaskhan make movements, their babies may imitate their actions. This mimicry is how the children learn to behave when alone. Oddly, Kangaskhan always sleep standing up, a reflex that allows them to rest with their babies still in their pouches.","Horsea nest in coral reefs, using their tails to grip onto rocks or coral in strong currents to prevent themselves from being washed away. They also use their tails to balance themselves while swimming. They can use their dorsal fins to swim in any direction while facing forwards, making them better adapted to movement than their close relatives Skrelp. Horsea eat insects and moss above the surface of the water. They locate targets and then shoots precise blobs of ink at them, knocking them below. When threatened, Horsea can also instinctively shoot ink into the water, turning it murky and buying themselves time to escape. They are playful Pokémon, oftentimes seen tangling their tails together as they swim about reefs (and occasionally ocean caverns as well). They may also shoot ink at or race each other through the water for fun. Thousands of Horsea eggs hatch during the spring, almost simultaneously. Oddly, these young are raised by their male parents rather than their female ones.","Seadra, like Horsea, are often found in coral reefs and underwater caves. They hook their tail onto rocks or coral branches to rest, preventing them from being swept away. Seadra can also use their fins and tails to swim backwards. Though female Seadra lay eggs, the males of the species raise the young and and are fiercely protective of them. They will attack anyone who comes too close with Bubble beam or Twister. When hunting, Seadra create whirlpools to trap and disorient prey. Whirlpools from larger Seadra can be powerful enough to capsize fishing boats. They swallow ​food whole using their long snouts. Their fins are very sharp and leak a poison that paralyzes muscles. Many divers unwittingly are stabbed by Seadra while examining coral by. Despite their toxicity, Seadra fins as well as bones are highly prized in folk medicine, though they have not actually been proven to cure anything. Though Seadra themselves are not Dragon- or Poison-types, their DNA contains some of the types’ characteristic segments.","Goldeen are strong swimmers that can reach speeds of up to five knots. In warm spring seasons, it is common to see groups of them swimming upriver against powerful currents and waterfalls in search of mates. Their beautiful, yet powerful fins billow behind them as they swim, giving them nicknames like “The Water Queens,\" \"The Water Dancers,\" or even \"Princesses of the Water.\" Though many wish to keep Goldeen in aquariums because of their elegant appearances, this is not a wise idea. Their horns can shatter thick glass with ease. Specialty glass specifically designed to prevent Goldeen and Seaking from escaping is available, but very costly; only professionals should uptake the hobby (the Cerulean Gym aquarium in Kanto, for example, is a popular destination to see them). In the wild, Goldeen will compete to see who have the largest and strongest horns. Goldeen prefer large bodies of water—another reason why hobbyists should not keep them in tanks—and will swim down streams in search of larger lakes or rivers. Some enthusiasts dedicate their lives to raising Goldeen. Goldeen will not hesitate to ram into foes if threatened, attacking with techniques such as Horn Attack.","Seaking can often be seen swimming up powerful currents in their cold, autumnal mating season. During this time, they become fatter and more colorful. Rivers they swim in may appear a bright red due to the sheer number of Seaking and Goldeen swimming up them. They can be seen jumping over rapids and waterfalls during their treks upstream. Male Seaking perform courtship rituals on the riverbed to woo females. The females, who possess smaller horns, are attracted to those with the brightest colors and the most captivating rituals. After mating, males bore holes into boulders for females to lay their eggs into. These “nests” are fiercely guarded by both parents, who will stay together until their eggs are hatched. Mates take turns patrolling around their nests, fending off attackers with jabs from their horns. Seaking will defend their eggs with their lives. These eggs hatch after a month or so, at which point the baby Goldeen are left to fend for themselves. Hobbyists have selectively bred Seaking for special horns as well as fins.","Staryu are mysterious Pokémon that lie on the seabed during the day and float up to the surface at night. They can regenerate extremely well; if any of their limbs are severed, they can easily grow them back. For this reason, Pokémon like Lumineon often nibble on them as a reliable source of food. Even a Staryu cut into pieces can regenerate as long as its core is intact. Their centers are vital to their survival and are irreplaceable These cores glow brightly at night when Staryu are active. The cores of sick Staryu glow faintly and flicker. Groups of Staryu, referred to as “constellations,” rise to the surface each night, cores aglow. They seem to float aimlessly (though they are actually filter-feeding), gazing at the stars. Their cores mysteriously pulse at the same rate as a human’s resting heartbeat. From above, oceans with large numbers of Staryu seem to mimic and align with the the twinkling skies above. Staryu only become active if the stars are visible; if clouds obscure the night sky, they will stay on the sea floor and their cores will not light up. Some say that Staryu are born from stardust falling into the sea from the above.","Starmie are also known as “the gems of the sea,” and for a good reason. Their iridescent cores shine with the 7 colors of the rainbow, a beautiful, but rare (as Starmie themselves are rather uncommon) sight in oceans. They can also flash their gems in a single color, alternating between different shades as if sending coded messages. Starmie swim by spinning themselves like propellers through the water. There are many myths purporting that Starmie in fact have extraterrestrial origins, due to their strong connections with the stars along with their strange radial symmetry. Many believe that when Starmie pulse light from their cores into the sky at night, they are actually beaming radio waves into outer space to wherever they came from. Others think they sprung from the reflections of stars on the ocean’s surface. Though recent studies have shown weak radio waves emanating from these Pokémon's gems, most other claims are unsupported by any scientific evidence whatsoever, and Starmie, despite popular myths, more than likely originated here on this planet. Oddly, some people have reported developing headaches when approaching these Pokémon. Unfortunately, Starmie poaching has been on the rise in recent years, with their gems being highly valued on the black market for jewelry.","Mr. Mime are masters in the art of pantomiming. They can often be seen performing in the streets of cities and towns, where they mime in exchange for food. Mr. Mime are exceptionally adept at creating false walls, pretending to be trapped behind invisible barriers using their hands. However, they have the ability to solidify these walls with a peculiar force emitted from their fingertips, all the while keeping them transparent. Their fingers can vibrate, slow, and then stop air, creating completely invisible walls. They can also use this ability to execute moves such as Barrier, Reflect, Light ​Screen, Safeguard, Wide Guard, and Quick Guard, all of which protect them from various attacks in battle. Mr. Mime can also pantomime other objects, such as doors, stairs, and even automobiles. Believing in these “false” objects can in fact make them become real and tangible, albeit not visible. Interrupting a performing Mr. Mime is extremely rude and taboo; they will not hesitate to discipline troublemakers by using Double Slap. Scientists believe that in the past, Mr. Mime had smaller hands than they do now, and that they in fact evolved larger hands in order to more efficiently pantomime.","Scyther live in packs in grasslands and forests. Young Scyther also train in mountains. They are very aggressive, but intelligent Pokémon. Scyther silently stalk their prey, camouflaging in trees or grasses before leaping out with ninja-like speed and slashing their targets to bits with their blades. They attack so quickly that their movements cannot be seen; they can appear to be in multiple places at once as they dart about. They use this to their advantages while hunting. If Scyther are spotted by their quarries, they will dash around them using Double Team to bewilder them. Their blades are sharp enough to slice through logs like butter. Scyther often sharpen them against boulders, and will use them to cut meat into more manageable pieces before eating. Scyther can also fly, though they rarely actually choose to do so. These Pokémon are especially popular in the Alola region. Leaders of Scyther packs command respect from the others members. However, their positions can be challenged at any time in battles. If a leader loses, it is exiled from the group to wander alone. These exiled Scyther generally tend to be more aggressive than those found in packs.","Jynx are found in secluded, snowy areas. Though rare, they seem to become more common during strong blizzards. As Jynx walk, they sway their hips alluringly. Depending on their emotions, they may move in slightly different manners. Their strange movements compel those who see them to move with them, dancing in unison. Those moving may not even realize they are swaying their hips until someone else (who is probably also dancing) points it out to them. Jynx use their dancing to “talk” to one another. However, they also have a form of oral speech, which sounds ​uncannily similar to a foreign human language. For this reason, some musicians have written songs specifically for Jynx to sing. Despite their curious behavior, Jynx are kind Pokémon. As they walk and sway, people and Pokémon alike subconsciously follow them. During blizzards, they will often lead these hypnotized beings to safety away from the cold. Then, they disappear almost as quickly as they appeared. When Jynx walk, they mysteriously leave no footprints in the snow. No one is quite sure why.","Electabuzz are most often found near power plants, feeding on generated electricity. Workers there must maintain their populations, as left unchecked, they can easily consume all of the power and cause blackouts. In fact, hungry Electabuzz account for up to half of the annual power outages in Kanto (though a recent report admitted that the Kanto Power Company had in fact blamed many outages on Electabuzz when in truth they were due to errors on their part). They may occasionally wander into towns searching for food. This can also cause problems, as they will consume electricity directly from homes. However, many areas actually employ Electabuzz as natural lightning rods; in the wild, they will compete for spots likely to be struck by lightning during storms. Electabuzz communicate by touching each other and transferring currents. When threatened, they will use the move Thunder Punch. However, it takes them some time to windmill their arms to power up, allowing foes to flee while they are charging. This winding allows them to produce additional power for their attacks. Their charges make them glow whitish-blue in the dark. Standing near an Electabuzz will make one’s hairs stand on end from static electricity.","Magmar have internal body temperatures of nearly 2,200°F (1,200°C). Their bodies are always cloaked in flames, so they constantly glow orange. This allows them to hide in the lava around their volcanic homes. Magmar make the air surrounding them shimmer like the surface of the sun. When they breathe flames, the sheer heat waves created are enough to scorch entire swathes of grass and trees; they will let out bursts of flames when they sneeze. They also dislikes cold places, and will use their fire-breathing abilities to make areas more suitable for themselves While active in warm climates, they tend to be sluggish in ​cooler ones; those in Alola are said to be heartier than those in other reasons. Magmar intimidate foes by spewing flames all over themselves. If enemies aren’t discouraged, they will attack with Flamethrower or Fire Punch. Magmar can exhale deeply to increase the shimmering effects around them, making them more difficult to see and giving them time to escape. They can also use Smokescreen to a similar effect. Magmar have the ability to heal themselves in magma; they can submerge themselves in lava to fully heal their wounds.","Pinsir hunt using their two large horns. They rush at and grip foes with these antlers, shaking them wildly. Their thorny protrusions stab victims as Pinsir crush them in half. These antlers are strong enough to snap logs. However, if Pinsir are unable to tear their prey in half, they will toss them far away by swinging their heads. Pinsir hate the cold and will dig burrows in forests to hibernate if the weather stays chilly for too long. They become sluggish if exposed to low temperatures, but will be rejuvenated once it warms again. In areas with cool nights, Pinsir sleep near the roots of trees in underground burrows or covered in leaves, while in places with warmer ones, they choose to sleep in or near the treetops. In addition to hunting, Pinsir also enjoy eating tree sap. Individual Pinsir have different preferences as to which kinds of trees have the best sap. They will often compete with Heracross, who also love tree sap, for choice trees; in Alola, they instead compete with Vikavolt for food, and in fact seem to get along quite well with Heracross. One may see these pairs of Pokémon battling it out for these trees.","Tauros live in large herds on plains. They enjoy being enraged and will sometimes whip themselves with their own tails to anger themselves before stampeding. They also whip themselves during battles to increase their fighting spirits. They headbutt each other and lock horns to test their own strength, taking pride in scars gained from this. If Tauros cannot find any sparring partners, they will ram into trees and knock them down out of boredom. The strongest Tauros of a herd is its leader and protector. Leaders must frequently defend their titles by butting head with challengers; as such, they usually will have the longest, thickest, and most-scarred horns of the herd. Tauros only charge in straight lines. Once they start running, they will not stop until they hit something. Tauros are also angered by the color red and will charge upon sight of anything of this hue, even the blood from their own wounds. Despite their aggressiveness, however, Tauros are herbivores that graze on grass and other plants. Domesticated Tauros are considerably calmer than their wild counterparts; they are still quick to anger, however. As Alolan Tauros are mostly descended from domesticated ancestors, they are considerably calmer than those of other regions and can even be ridden with some training.","Magikarp are often regarded as the “most useless Pokémon.” The most they normally can do is use Splash, which does absolutely nothing. Although they can reach heights of 7 feet using this move, they are unable to change direction in the air, so they land in the exact same place. Legend has it that older Magikarp can splash over mountains, though this has never been seen. In fact, splashing Magikarp actually make easy prey for Flying-type Pokémon like Pidgeotto, who can snatch them up as they bounce. They are also weak swimmers, unable to swim through even weak currents. As a result, many of them congregate in small ponds or lakes, unable swim through river currents. Magikarp are very hardy, however, with strong survival instincts and immune systems. They are able to tolerate waters of nearly any salinity, depth, and pollution level. It is believed that in the ancient relatives of Magikarp were actually far more powerful than they are today; why they became so weak is the subject of great research.","Gyarados are powerful and ruthless Pokémon whose fangs can crush boulders and whose scales are as hard as steel. When Magikarp evolve into  Gyarados, their brains signals for more production of a hormone that causes them to become more violent. Gyarados are known for their destructive tendencies. When angered, raging Gyarados will destroy nearby fields and cities, not stopping until everything they can see is in ruins. They will fire the devastating move Hyper Beam to burn forests and buildings to the ground, even in torrential storms. The flames their attacks create take ​huge amounts of water to extinguish. Their rampages can last as long as a month. Gyarados have been mentioned in many pieces of ancient literature, appearing during war and other times of conflict and destroying everything indiscriminately. It is sometimes referred to as \"the deity of destruction\" in these texts. These stories often end with both sides of the feud being forced to unite to defeat the Gyarados. Gyarados are very difficult to tame, so it takes an especially courageous and determined trainer to raise one successfully.","Lapras are intelligent, gentle Pokémon. They can perfectly understand human speech and are well-known for their willingness to ferry people, Pokémon, and goods on their backs across bodies of water. However, due to their gentle dispositions, they also rarely fight. This has made them easy targets for poachers, who prize their shells for their purported (but scientifically unsupported) medical properties. Lapras currently near extinction, with the few remaining being spread across the vast oceans. When in good moods, Lapras will sing beautiful, enchanting melodies that are said to calm rough seas. Lone Lapras will sing plaintive songs, calling out to any other Lapras that may be nearby. Though they live in cold seas, they migrate to warmer ones to raise their young; even in these tropical areas, a slight cold continues to radiate from their skin.  Rumors of freshwater Lapras have also surfaced from time to time. Lapras are happiest in pods, as they enjoy being in groups. Conservation efforts have helped restore Lapras populations somewhat; in Alola, where they are a important form of transportation, they have actually surpassed historical numbers and have started to negatively impact local fish Pokémon populations because of this.","Ditto have the unique ability to copy the DNA or molecular structure of anything to turn into near-perfect replicas. However, they cannot maintain their disguises while laughing, oddly enough. They also generally need visual references to use Transform; though they can work from memory, they often gets details wrong while doing so. Individual Ditto may also have their own strengths and weaknesses when it comes to transforming into certain things. Their adaptability has allowed them to live in a variety of habitats, but they generally stay near humans for unknown reasons. When Ditto sleep, they morph into rocks to avoid detection. Due to their DNA-copying abilities, Ditto can breed with anything that can reproduce, other than themselves (Ditto reproduce by asexual budding and seem to oddly dislike one another). No one knows where Ditto came from, but a popular theory states that they in fact originated from a failed attempt to clone Mew. Though not proven, Ditto do have a similar coloration and the ability to transform. Additionally, they are also found in Cerulean Cave and the Pokémon Mansion, both of which have strong ties to Mew.","Eevee DNA is irregular and extremely unstable. It mutates easily, so as a result, Eevee can easily adapt their bodies to nearly any environment based on the surrounding stimuli. Despite their capabilities to live nearly anywhere, Eevee are seldom seen in the wild; they are believed to have descended from centuries of selective breeding by humans, so feral populations are rare (inbreeding may have contributed to their odd DNA). It is said that their DNA is so unstable that given time, they may even start to look like their trainers (though this has not been studied or proven). Eevee are a very popular Pokémon, rivaling the reputations of many starter Pokémon. In fact, some regions have even considered using them as starters themselves, as they can evolve into many Pokémon of different types. Their evolutions are also colloquially referred to as “Eeveelutions,” a portmanteau of the words “Eevee” and “evolutions.” Eevee are loyal Pokémon, always staying by the sides of their trainers. They use their large, sensitive ears to warn their trainers of any threats nearby. Additionally, their smooth fur is hypoallergenic, so trainers with sensitivities to most furry Pokémon can still for the most part safely train Eevee.","Eevee who spend large amounts of time in water and are exposed to Water Stones will evolve into Vaporeon. Their fish-like tails are purported to be the source of mermaid myths, but due to their freshwater natures contradicting with the saltwater habitats of mermaids, these myths are more often attributed to oceanic Dewgong. Vaporeon can swim in both saltwater and freshwater, however, though they very much prefers clean lakes to oceans. Their cellular structures are close to the molecular structure of water. Because of this property, they can essentially melt into water at will. The shape of their gills and fins make them hydrodynamic and allow them to swim gracefully. Some believe that their fins will quiver before a rainstorm, but crease prior to a drought. Vaporeon only live in clean water, so lakes they will swim in are safe to drink from. To defend themselves, they may “melt” into water using Acid Armor to confuse foes. Then, they will suddenly solidify elsewhere and blast enemies with the powerful Hydro Pump.","In drier areas with little water and unusually high amounts of electrical activity, Eevee may evolve into Jolteon when exposed to Thunder Stones. These Pokémon are as fast as lightning and can fire bolts of electricity at up to 10,000 volts. They are very temperamental, however, and have frequent mood swings that affect their power; Jolteon experiencing stronger emotions, such as rage or elation, launch stronger attacks. Their cells all exude weak charges, which they can concentrate with static electricity in their fur into more powerful bolts. Additionally, by charging their fur negatively, they can bristle it into piercing spikes. Jolteon can launch these spikes at foes by using Pin Missile. Their charged fur emits a constant crackling noise. When frightened or startled, even by their own trainers, Jolteon will bristle their fur and will not hesitate to launch the devastating attack Thunder. Their electrogenetic organs are located in their lungs, causing a crackling sound whenever they exhale. However, despite their fickle temperaments, Jolteon are very loyal Pokémon, and can easily be trained to only bristle on command or in battle. ​","Eevee exposed to Fire Stones in hot climates will evolve into Flareon. Their internal body temperatures can reach 1,650°F (900°C), and the flames they breathes can be up to 3,100°F (1,700°C). Their fur, though fluffy, is efficient at expelling heat from their bodies into the surrounding air to cool them off. As a result, the air around Flareon is usually significantly hotter than the ambient temperature. Flareon have flame sacs inside their bodies. When preparing to attack using moves like the scorching Fire Blast, they inhale deeply, filling the sacs with air. Flame glands in their bodies mix the air with volatile gases produced by their glands, igniting the mixtures. Then, they exhale the flames to attack. Like some other Fire-types, Flareon can also use the move Smog by releasing their volatile gases out of their mouths without igniting them. Though Flareon are tolerant of heat, they are not often found near volcanoes since they constantly need lots of fresh air to cool down their bodies. They are more tolerant of the cold than other Fire-types because of their plush fur.","The first artificial Pokémon, Porygon, were designed by Silph Co. about 20 years ago and consist entirely of digital code. Though they can take crude, blocky, physical forms, they usually assume the form of data and travel through cyberspace. Their non-organic origins mean that they do not require oxygen, water, or other necessities of organic life to survive. Because of this property, Porygon are strong candidates for space travel. In fact, this is what they were programmed to do; however, there has not been any success in launching one into orbit to this day. Porygon are basic Pokémon that can only perform tasks enabled in their codes. This includes moves like Conversion and Sharpen, along with other functions generally reserved for organic life forms, such as eating and breeding. Though Porygon do not require food to survive, they have been programmed to intake things such as Berries and convert them into energy. Porygon are protected with a DRM and cannot be duplicated digitally. However, they have been coded to be able to breed independently with Ditto. By modern day standards, some parts of Porygon's code are considered obsolete, though they still remain perfectly functional, if a bit clunky.","Omanyte went extinct 2 billion years ago, but can be revived from Helix Fossils found in caves that were once submerged in water. They store air in their shells, which they can regulate to float at different depths in the sea. They twist their 10 tentacles to swim about. When attacked, Omanyte can withdraw into their hard shells. Omanyte and their evolutions Omastar are unusually intelligent, especially for fossil Pokémon. Revived individuals have demonstrated puzzle-solving skills on par with their distant, but similarly intelligent modern relatives Octillery. They have also ​shown the ability to change their responses to stimuli over time. When randomly presented with boxes that were either circular or rectangular, Omanyte would first investigate both kinds. However, when the circular ones were filled with dried plankton (as they filter-feed), and the rectangular ones were left empty, they began ignoring square boxes in favor of circular ones. When the two were switched, the Omanyte switched their preferences as well. A recent archaeological discovery found a Helix fossil with the bite marks of an Archeops on it, indicating that they likely were the prey of these ancient predators.","Like Omanyte, Omastar can regulate the pressure within their shells to sink and rise to varying depths. However, they generally only use this to travel from shallow reefs to deep sea floors, and vice versa; they conserve energy by walking rather than swimming when hunting. Unlike their pre-evolutions, however, Omastar are hunters, capturing prey such as the prehistoric ancestors of modern-day Shellder. Once they latch onto their prey with their tentacles, they will never let go unless their arms are severed off. They can regenerate their tentacles over the course of a few weeks. Omastar crack open shells using ​their beak-like mouths, sucking out the innards of their prey. Omastar can also launch the spikes on their shells at foes. However, it can take weeks for these spikes to grow back, leaving vulnerable holes in the meantime. It is believed that cooling oceans were the reason that Omastar became extinct Their prey began moving to warmer equatorial waters, but their own heavy shells prevented them from keeping up with their food supply.","Scientists have successfully been able to revive Kabuto from Dome Fossils, which are often found in once-submerged oceanic caves. These Pokémon went extinct 300,000,000 years ago. Kabuto have four eyes, two on their backs and two under their shells. Both pairs are functioning; they use their red eyes while searching for food on the sea floor and their smaller black eyes while hiding from predators in the sand, leaving these secondary pairs aboveground. When flipped over, Kabuto have great difficulty righting themselves, so they become easy targets for opportunistic predators that can attack their soft, exposed undersides. Kabuto ​feed by biting and draining fluids from their prey, a process that can be fatal for smaller victims. They tend to attack the heads of larger, slow-moving aquatic Pokémon, using their claws to dig into flesh and attaching themselves with ease. Kabuto have primitive lungs, which allow them to climb onto beaches for up to 30 minutes at a time. However, they must then return to the water afterwards, or risk drying out and being asphyxiated. Scientists have very recently discovered that in some small regions, Kabuto have survived to this very day, though these regions have not yet been revealed to the public.","Kabutops can tuck in their limbs and slither at high speeds through the water, capable of reaching up to 29 knots. They slash prey with their sharp, sickle-like arms and drain their body fluids. Kabutops can also leave the water and walk on land for extended periods of time, up to 12 hours in humid environments. This allowed them to thrive as apex predators for a long time, as they could hunt both aquatic and terrestrial prey. However, their lungs are still not developed enough to allow them to stray far away from the water. While it is not known for certain what could have caused their extinction, a popular theory states that some kind of event led to drastically fluctuating temperatures worldwide. Ice caps melted and refroze over and over again, causing sea levels to bounce back and forth. Kabuto and Kabutops were unable to survive completely on land when their shoreline habitats dried up. Additionally, many of the species they preyed on died out during this time, so most of the surviving individuals were likely starved to extinction.","Aerodactyl ruled prehistoric skies. They once glided through the air at high speeds, shrieking high-pitched cries that struck fear in the hearts of Pokémon everywhere. Their saw-like, serrated fangs can cut through flesh with ease. When Aerodactyl hunt, they aim for the throats of prey. They attack from above, tearing out the necks of victims with their teeth. Some research has shown that they may be loosely linked to modern-day Dragon-types. Though superb fliers, they were actually quite slow and clumsy on land. Today, Aerodactyl can be revived from Old Ambers. Though they are just as ruthless and aggressive, they can be trained to control their primal instincts. Unfortunately, the first successful resurrection of an Aerodactyl resulted in some casualties at the lab in question. Surprisingly, Aerodactyl are omnivores, eating various fruits and Berries in addition to meat. They seem to especially enjoy Pamtre Berries, perhaps because these Berries are closely related to an ancient fruit they consumed long ago. Aerodactyl also love Aspear Berries, though no studies have linked them to any fruits from when Aerodactyl were alive. It is widely believed that a meteor impact caused the extinction of Aerodactyl.","Snorlax only do two things: eat and sleep. They will only wake from their slumbers to eat, consuming up to 900 pounds of food in one sitting. Then, they doze off again, steadily becoming lazier as well as larger as they grow and continue this cycle. Some Snorlax will awaken as sporadically as only once a month. When they are resting, they sleep so soundly that children will often use their bellies as trampolines, since they do not ever stir when bounced on. Their digestive juices can dissolve nearly anything, and their immune systems are hardy enough to allow them to consume moldy or mildly poisonous foods. Their rumbling stomachs are so loud that they can be mistaken for their cries. Waking sleeping Snorlax will turn these normally docile Pokémon into aggressive attackers. A Body Slam from a Snorlax can knock a target over the horizon. Snorlax can occasionally be nuisances in urban areas, eating garbage and passing out in the middle of streets. Luckily, the sound of Poké Flutes have been known to wake them peacefully.","Articuno is the first member of the legendary birds, also known as the “winged mirages” due to their elusive natures. Articuno is said to be found on snowy mountain peaks, soaring from mountain to mountain. As it flies, it cools the surrounding air, leaving a trail of glistening snow behind it. It is rarely seen, as it cloaks its mountain home in a near-unbearable blizzard. Articuno is said to appear before lost travelers in snowy mountains, right before they succumb to the cold. It is also linked with the ocean, and is said to control the freezing of icy polar waters. Articuno avoids most contact ​with humans, like the other legendary birds, and also dislikes getting involved in battles. When spotted, it will cloak itself in mist or snowstorms and disappear just as quickly as it appeared. Articuno is said to have hatched from an egg frozen in ice, hidden deep in the snow on a secluded mountain range. It hatched when a mysterious silver feather fell on the mountaintop, melting the nearby ice and allowing the egg to surface.","Zapdos is said to dwell in thunderclouds, sending bolts of lighting to the ground below. The sky turns dark and stormy everywhere it flies, and its body emits crackling noises and sparks. As it soars, its wings sparkle due to the sheer amount of electricity they hold.  Like the other birds, Zapdos is rarely seen, and is said only to appear when thunderclouds part down the middle. It can gain power when struck by lightning bolts, both its own as well as natural ones. Because of how it becomes stronger by being around electricity, it is said to stop by at areas with large amounts of power, such as ​power plants; sightings have been reported at the Kanto Power Plant, for example. Zapdos is also said to be linked with oceans, controlling the currents flowing beneath the waves. Legend has it that Zapdos hatched when an egg was struck by lighting at the same moment a strange silver feather landed on it from above. The dark storm clouds parted around the area as the egg hatched, and Zapdos emerged to take off into the clear sky.","Moltres’s wings leave a beautiful trail of embers as it flies, turning the surrounding sky a glowing red. Strangely, these embers mysteriously don’t burn anything they land on. They are actually purported to have healing properties, restoring life in forests and crops damaged by harsh winters. Moltres prefers hot areas, especially active volcanoes, but does not stay permanently anywhere. It is said to bring spring to wintry areas, following the change of the seasons by flying south. It is thought to submerge itself deep into magma to heal itself. Moltres is also said to control the warmth and ​fertility of tropical oceans. Due to its constant migration, Moltres has been spotted in multiple places, such as Mt. Ember in the Sevii Islands and Mt. Silver in Johto. It is said to have hatched from an egg floating in the volcanic magma. A lone silver feather floated from the sky above into the volcano, landing onto the egg. The volcano erupted, and in the midst of the blast, a winged, flaming figure emerged and flew off into the horizon.","Until a fisherman caught a live Dratini from a large underwater colony about a century ago (reputedly after a 10-hour struggle), these Pokémon were long thought to be myths. This has given them the nickname the “Mirage Pokémon” (officially, they are still the Dragon Pokémon). Even today, these elusive Pokémon dwell at the bottoms of deep lakes, where they are difficult to find. Young Dratini are rather large for newborns, with some having been reported be be as long as 6.5 feet (2 meters). As they age, they grow even larger, shedding their skins periodically (sometimes as often as every day). They are extremely vulnerable after shedding, so they will hide behind powerful waterfalls away from their colonies during these times. Their bodies grow at an astounding rate, so they must shed often. These skins were likely the source of myths regarding mysterious, lake-dwelling, serpentine creatures. For a long time, people were convinced that the these skins were hoaxes. It was not until scientists compared their DNA to that of actual Dratini was finally accepted that not only were the skins authentic, but that Dratini were real as well. Today, shed Dratini skin are often treated to make luxury leather goods.","Dragonair are always cloaked with mystical, invisible auras that calm those around them. The auras seem to come from the orbs on their bodies. The spheres also seem to be enable them to influence the weather. When these orbs glow, Dragonair are using their auras to alter the climate—by making it rain or parting a storm, for example. Their bodies also glow slightly while doing so. Also known as the “Divine Pokémon,” Dragonair were long thought to be mythical and worshipped by farmers for their purported weather-altering powers. People often left offerings at their lakes in hope of favorable weather. Dragonair also have the ability to fly. They ​do not use this ability often, though, as they prefer staying submerged deep at the bottoms of freshwater lakes. When they do fly, however, the small feather-like ornaments on their head spread out like wings. Whether this is purely aesthetic or an aid them in flight somehow is not yet known. Dragonair shed their skin periodically, but not as frequently as Dratini. These skins were at first mistaken for huge Dratini, and fetched hefty sums as collectors clamored over them. According to popular legend, seeing a Dragonair flying overhead at the start of a new year is a sign of good health for the rest of the year.","Like their pre-evolutions, Dragonite have a popular nickname; they are often referred to as “Sea Guardian,” or even \"the sea incarnate.\" These benevolent, but extremely rare, Pokémon fly around seas. They can circumnavigate the globe in just 16 hours. They are known to rescue drowning Pokémon and people from stormy seas, which they can easily weather with their sturdy bodies. They also lead ships out of ocean storms. Dragonite are very intelligent, with minds on par with those of adult humans. Though almost always gentle, Dragonite can go on destructive rampages when angered. They will relentlessly destroy everything around them until they tire and collapse. Luckily, it takes a lot to anger Dragonite, as they are incredibly kind and forgiving. In battle, Dragonite can decimate opponents with the powerful Outrage. Legend has it that somewhere far out in the middle of the sea, there exists an island populated solely by Dragonite; a popular myth tells of a shipwrecked man being rescued and taken to this island. To date, despite many efforts to locate this island, it has not yet been found.","As the name suggests, Mewtwo is essentially Mew, Version 2. The result of manmade experiments with the goal of reproducing Mew, Mewtwo was born in a laboratory said to be hidden in the Cinnabar Pokémon Mansion. It was supposed to be a bigger, more powerful Mew--the perfect battling Pokémon--and in that aspect, it was successful. However, it also became more aggressive, breaking out of its lab and destroying it before fleeing into solitude. While part of its anger may have been from the numerous gene splices it underwent, much of it may have stemmed from the fact ​that it had become self-aware; it knew that it was a clone, that it did not belong. It was created without any compassion--its sole purpose was to battle and to win. Mewtwo is said to meditate, not for peace, but to conserve energy for fighting. One look into its eyes to see its seething rage can strike fear in any being. It is said that this Pokémon has the most savage heart of them all, and only the most virtuous trainer could ever even try to reach out to it.","Mew is said to be the ancestor of all Pokémon, containing the DNA of all discovered so far. It is capable of learning nearly any move and can transform into any Pokémon. It is rarely ever seen, leading many to believe that it is just a mirage. It can also make itself invisible at will, making sightings even more elusive. Mew is often depicted surrounded in a pink bubble or sphere. A single hair from this Pokémon was used to create Mewtwo. Mew is said to only appear to the pure-hearted who desire to see it. The number of sightings have been increasing over the past few years, though it is not certain how many of them are actually legitimate. Unlike Mewtwo, Mew appears to be playful and innocent. Notably, many sightings seem to have involved children or soft music, especially lullabies. Recently, there were also a huge number of sightings near a truck in the port of Vermillion City, Kanto. However, they was proven to be nothing more than a hoax. The rumor, though was enough to restart major Mew research programs, which had gone stagnant after the Mewtwo incident.","Roughly a third of all beginning trainers from Johto choose Chikorita to be their starting Pokémon. They are regarded as the easiest of the Johto starters to train, due to their docile natures--they aren’t as rambunctious as Totodile nor as flighty as Cyndaquil. Chikorita primarily photosynthesize energy using their large leaves. Because of this, they spend most of their time peacefully sunbathing. Their leaves are highly sensitive to temperature and humidity. They love bright, sunny weather--in fact, one of the only times trainers may their see Chikorita upset is when the Pokémon are prevented from going out on beautiful days. Their leaves (and the buds around their necks) also release a calming fragrance that causes those around them to become more amiable. When threatened, they wave their leaves around to placate foes. This scent has been proven effective enough to be marketed to consumers; Erika of the Celadon Gym touts it under the label Synthesis, for instance. Thanks to their calm natures, it is no surprise that Chikorita continue to be popular Johto starter Pokémon.","Upon evolution, Chikorita become more energetic; their scents also change to match. In contrast to the placating aroma of Chikorita, Bayleef release an invigorating fragrance from their budding “necklaces” that can perk up even the most tired people and Pokémon (the scent is also marketed as a perfume known as Work Up by the Celadon Gym Leader Erika). The fragrance can make one feel renewed and ready to fight. Oftentimes, people who raise Chikorita for their calming scents are surprised after they evolve; they suddenly want to get up and out of the house to have fun. Each of the curled-up leaves surrounding a Bayleef’s neck contains a small, growing, flower, responsible for releasing their characteristic fragrance. Bayleef can sometimes be stubborn and even hot-headed at times, but they still retain the friendliness and affection they had as Chikorita. As they approach evolution, their scents strengthen and the buds around their necks enlarge and become more vivid. Bayleef also become more lively as they grow, sometimes to the exasperation of their trainers.","﻿When Bayleef evolve into Meganium, they regain the ability to calm people with the scent released from the beautiful flowers around their necks. There is almost never fighting near Meganium, as their fragrance can calm even the most aggressive of foes. Trainers often compare the feeling of relaxation from being around Meganium to a “day in a tranquil forest,” fitting for such Pokémon. They hate conflict and prefers to placate enemies with their aroma, though they can still release the invigorating scent they did as Bayleef when necessary. Meganium can attack with moves like Razor Leaf and Petal Dance when they feel threatened. Their breaths can revive dead flora; the grasslands in which these Pokémon are rarely found in the wild are beautifully vibrant as a result. They communicate by releasing various scents and waving the stamens on their heads. Meganium remain extremely affectionate and defensive of their trainers, which is why they are worthy choices for any trainers looking forward to starting their journeys in the Johto region.","Though extremely rare in the wild, Cyndaquil are among the most popular Pokémon native to the Johto region, being the resident Fire-type starter Pokémon. They are very timid creatures; their first reaction to anything new is to run away and curl up into balls. If angered or startled, the flames on their backs will erupt. They burn vigorously most of the time, but will sputter and die out sporadically if the Pokémon are tired. If the flames are not enough to deter enemies, Cyndaquil can also use Smokescreen to cloak themselves and buy time to flee. They rarely fight back, due to their flighty natures, but may attack with Ember or Swift when cornered. Trainers must be careful when raising Cyndaquil, as they are easily startled--frightened Cyndaquil will instinctively flare up their backs. Despite this potential problem, they can be very playful and cheerful, if a bit skittish. It is said that trainers who choose Cyndaquil at the beginning of their journeys also tend to be good caretakers of children, especially younger, timid ones.","Quilava retain the general personalities that they had as Cyndaquil, but replace their skittishness with caution. They are extremely wary of new situations, and will react to nearly any sign of danger. However, instead of curling up into balls, Quilava prefer to fight back. In battle, when Quilava turn their backs against their opponents, they are preparing to flare up their backs. These flames burn hotter in combat. Their fur is also nonflammable and does not conduct heat, allowing them to keep their fires burning for long periods of time. This fur is notably very soft, with many remarking that its texture is similar to that of Furret—synthetic versions have been used by many designer fashionistas. Quilava are also very agile, allowing them to maneuver around attacks thrown at them. They can utilize the move Flame Wheel to defend themselves, leaving behind lingering trails of fire that provide barriers against opponents. In fact, these lines of scorched earth are often signs that a Quilava has recently been in the area. ","Typhlosion completely abandon the skittishness and caution of their pre-evolutions. They are extremely territorial and will not hesitate to attack anything that enters their domains with the powerful Eruption. When enraged, they heat up to extraordinarily high temperatures, causing the air to shimmer around them and setting anything they touch ablaze. By rubbing their blazing fur against itself, they can create giant explosions that incinerate everything nearby. Brutal fights between two Typhlosion over territory can sometimes devastate acres of grasslands. These Pokémon will flare up their manes to determine dominance; the individuals with larger manes gain control of the land, unless the losers decide to fight it out in battle. Females are highly protective of their young, caring for them until adolescence, and will destroy anything they see as threats to them. Despite their aggressive tendencies, Typhlosion are also extremely loyal and will defend their trainers with all their strength, making them strong choices for starters.","Of all the Johto starters, Totodile are certainly the most energetic. They love to play--but unfortunately for most trainers, their favorite games almost all involve biting. They have the habit of chomping nearly anything novel that moves, and due to the raw strength of their jaws, they will often crush the things they bite. The Totodile given out as starter Pokémon in Johto are all trained to not bite humans, but the same cannot be said about the rare wild Totodile one may occasionally come across; while very playful and friendly with humans, they will snap at the arms and legs of people when they lower their guards to “investigate” the foreign beings. Though they are simply “playing,” these bites can cause serious injury, sometimes even resulting in fractured bones. Even trained Totodile may occasionally crunch on and destroy possessions like watches, bags, phones, and on at least one recorded occasion, Pokédexes. Due to these potential obstacles, Totodile are often seen as the hardest, though perhaps the most rewarding, to raise Johto starters.","When Totodile evolve into Croconaw, their bite strength increases even further, but they luckily aren’t as prone to biting everything they see. Croconaw have exactly 48 fangs, all of which are slanted inwards and curved like fishhooks. This angle makes it nearly impossible to remove Croconaw after they bite; they will refuse to let go after snapping onto anything, holding on until their fangs fall off. Luckily for them, though, these teeth can grow back in as little as a week. Croconaw can open their jaws wide enough to latch onto things nearly twice the size of their heads. When they swim, only the spiked crests on their heads and backs are visible; the rest of their bodies remain submerged underwater as they hunt fish, their primary source of food. When not hunting, they are known to bite stones to test the strength of their jaws and teeth. Bite marks on rocks near lakeshores and riversides are signs of Croconaw territory. Loose, fishhook-shaped teeth lying on the ground and floating in the water are another sign that Croconaw are likely nearby.","Feraligatr are more adept in the water than on land, but they are more than capable of terrestrial travel. They can walk on both bipedally and quadrupedally, though they prefer the latter. However, when they spot enemies or prey, Feraligatr can quickly charge forward at a blinding speed on two legs to capture them between their powerful jaws, shaking their heads to tear up their victims. They can intimidate foes simply by opening their giant mouths and roaring; this display, along with the size of the red crests on their heads, is also used in displays of dominance. They can use Crunch to crush boulders with ease and can knock back foes with the powerful Aqua Tail. Like Croconaw, Feraligatr swim with just the upper halves of their heads and their back crests above the water. They swish their powerful tails and arms to propel themselves while using their arms and legs to steer and stay afloat. For trainers who are willing to endure the antics of their pre-evolutions, the brute strength and power of Feraligatr makes them great candidates for starter Pokémon in Johto.","Sentret are capable of walking both on two legs and on all fours, but they spend most of their time resting on their tails. Using powerful muscles in these appendages, Sentret can lift themselves up to scout out their surroundings. Their sensitive ears can pick up minute sounds, alerting them quickly to potential dangers. Being social Pokémon, Sentret live in groups. Members take shifts on guard duty; at any given hour, there will be at least one Sentret keeping watch for a group. They are very nervous Pokémon--upon the first sign of trouble, they will begin thumping their tails wildly and crying out to alert their allies. Sentret care closely for and are heavily dependent upon their friends. If a Sentret is separated from its group, it becomes unable to sleep, partly from loneliness and partly from the constant, instinctual need to have an ally on guard duty--without anyone to split their patrols with, lone Sentret feel compelled to stay up and keep watch indefinitely all by themselves until they simply collapse from sheer exhaustion.","After evolving, Furret tend to stray away from their social groups, though they stay within the general area of their peers and often are seen meeting for “get-togethers” with them. Instead of groups, Furret choose to settle down with mates for life, making nests in narrow burrows that only they can fit into. These burrows are often maze-like in order to confuse potential predators looking for their offspring. Furret mother their children by wrapping their long bodies around their nests, caring for their young until they are old enough to join groups of their own. In battle, they are very flexible and agile. By squirming around in every direction, they can easily confuse enemies and escape with quick, precise dashes. This skill is also helpful when they are hunting their main prey, Rattata. Furret fur is prized for its softness. However, due to concerns about Pokémon cruelty, most major manufacturers have switched to faux-Furret, though a few black-market Furret sweaters and scarves unfortunately still surface every now and then.","Hoothoot are most well-known for their uncanny senses of time. Thanks to special organs that sense the earth’s rotation, these Pokémon have one of the most accurate internal clocks in the world. All Hoothoot in a forest will hoot at precisely the same time every day, together, without fail. They are nocturnal Pokémon that can often be seen sleeping in tree hollows during the day. Curiously, although they have two feet, they always stands on only one, even when sleeping. Like metronomes, Hoothoot sometimes rock back and forth to steady rhythms, with each sway being equivalent to one second; each second is a “tick” in their swaying. Hoothoot can be trained to hoot at a specific time every day, and for that reason, often are used in place of alarm clocks and watches for trainers traveling across regions. Their unbelievably precise readings of the time have led them and their evolution Noctowl to be revered as wise and all-knowing in the past, or even as divine messengers. This is especially true in Johto and Sinnoh folklore, regions where these Pokémon are most easily found.","Noctowl have long been regarded as shrewd Pokémon, capable of seeing into the future. It is sometimes called \"the emperor of dark nights.\" While clairvoyance is a task best left to their fellow Flying-type Xatu, Noctowl are nevertheless extremely wise Pokémon. They can solve mental problems on par with above-average human adults. Their heads are capable of turning 180°, both backwards and upside-down. It is thought that when a Noctowl completely inverts its head, it is in deep thought; in fact, this is a warning that signals caution, and the Noctowl may attack with a flurry of pecks if not left alone after this. Additionally, Noctowl are also a superb hunters. Their eyes are adapted to see with even the tiniest amounts of light, allowing them to fly around with ease even when the moon is obscured. Their soft feathers produce no sound when they flap, enabling them to sneak up on prey without being noticed. They can spot scurrying Rattata in forests below from over a mile (1.6 km) away. Despite their Normal- and Flying-types, Noctowl also possess a variety of Psychic-type techniques, such as Hypnosis, Extrasensory, and Zen Headbutt--perhaps some evidence towards their purported future-seeing powers. In many cultures, these Pokémon are regarded as symbols of wisdom and perception. ","Ledyba are social Pokémon that live in large swarms. They are very active, flying constantly about forests. However, when separated from their friends, they become withdrawn, not eating, drinking, or sleeping until reunited. Their feet secrete odorous fluids that they use to communicate with others; a sour smell signals anger, for instance. When temperatures drop, swarms will congregate together on lone trees, huddling together for warmth. They will use Reflect en-masse to protect their nests when in danger. Ledyba are major pollinators in forests; as their swarms flit about, they pollinate hundreds of flowers along the way. Their activity directly correlates with higher temperatures, being most active in the summer as well as in warm regions like Alola. Many gardeners release Ledyba swarms numbering in the thousands into their orchards to pollinate at the blow of a whistle. In exchange, they get a portion of the crop produced. Ledyba are strictly diurnal and are almost never seen being active at night. Curiously, they always sleep with their backs faced towards the stars; the coloration of the patterns on their their backs seem to be more vivid during these periods of time. Individual Ledyba seem to have different patterns.","Like Ledyba, Ledian are very social, living in swarms numbering up to the hundreds. However, Ledian are nocturnal, spending the day sleeping while wrapped up in grass or leaves. Ledian only become active when the stars are visible. It is said that this is because they feed on starlight, though this is believed to be an urban myth (Ledian subsist on leaves and Berries). They are also active in places with clean air; Ledian swarms are a good sign of air quality. As they fly, they scatter a shimmery glowing dust below. The true purpose of this powder is unknown, but a popular myth says that it ensures sweet dreams for good children and Pokémon sleeping below, as well as good fortune for those that it lands on. The size of the spots on their backs seem to correlate with the number of visible stars in the sky. The more stars out, the larger the spots. Likewise, if the stars are obscured by clouds, the spots will shrink and may even disappear entirely. Ledian defend themselves with rapid punches. Though individual blows are weak, they can launch multitudinous volleys to take down foes.","Spinarak silk, by weight, is one of the strongest materials known earth. Webs of it can support the weight of stones that fall into them without snapping. The material was once even used by fishers to make nets. Spinarak weave intricate webs of silk and then wait for prey to come by. They are very patient and can wait motionless for days or weeks for prey to arrive. When victims get tangled in their webs, they can detect the movements and even tell what was captured by the vibrations they create. Spinarak always wait for night to fall before investigating their catches. They subdue their prey, if still struggling, with venom, and then feast on their meals. Though their venom is not particularly strong, it is more than enough to incapacitate smaller prey. They can survive for weeks at a time on a good meal. The designs on their backs shift based on their moods. Spinarak and Ariados are often maligned in popular culture, portrayed as villains and aggressive hunters. In reality, Spinarak are actually playful Pokémon who only bite when threatened, and Ariados, while territorial, will also not attack unless provoked. One notable positive portrayal of these Pokémon was a popular children’s novel about the unlikely friendship between a young Swinub and a local Spinarak.","Ariados can spin silk from their rears as well as their mouths. They use this to confuse both predators and prey about their true heads. Their legs have tiny claws that allow them to climb on walls and ceilings to ambush prey from any direction. When hunting, they do not wait in their webs like Spinarak. Instead, they shoot globs of silk at targets and then let them return home; they can then follow them back to their shelters and prey on all of their friends as well. Ariados are nocturnal, wandering in search of food only at night. They are also very territorial. They clearly mark boundaries with strings of old webs. Entering an Ariados’s territory will provoke it into attacking in order to defend itself; unless one owns a Fire-, Rock-, or Flying-type, circumventing a webbed area is strongly advised. Ariados poison, if left untreated, can be fatal in as little as 2 minutes. They can also use Spider Web or Toxic Thread to trap escaping foes—another reason why bothering wild Ariados is a foolish idea. Despite their danger, some people enjoy wearing Ariados silk clothing because of its sturdiness.","When Golbat evolve, their legs become vestigial and they sprout a second pair of wings. While the pairs improves their maneuverability and airspeed, it also makes it difficult for them to stop, land, or rest. Crobat leave their caves at night, flying silently in the darkness in search of food. Though large, Crobat are silent fliers. They can alternate between their two sets of wings when tired, allowing them to fly for indefinite periods of time. When dawn arrives, Crobat will either return back to their caves or hang from under tree branches, wrapping their wings around themselves until thesun sets again. Crobat are not aggressive towards humans. They usually do not attack people, instead only going after what they see as viable prey. For unknown reasons, Crobat in the Alolan region are an exception to this, and have been known to attack unwary travelers. Their fangs are sharp and coated with an an analgesic that numbs the bitten area so that victims don't even know they've been bitten until afterwards. Crobat are more than capable of lashing out with moves like Air Slash or Poison Fang if angered. In other regions, Crobat prefer to feast on insects and small rodents, subduing them with poison before draining them of blood them. They are also known to enjoy fruit and Berries, but like Golbat, avoid Durin Berries at all costs.","Chinchou are most well-known for the two dangling bulbs (in reality highly-developed fins) sprouting from their heads. These bulbs help them attract prey in the deep ocean, luring them in with bright light and then electrocuting them when they come too close. For this reason, they are a popular Pokémon amongst fishermen, especially night anglers. They constantly release large amount of both positive and negative charges. Chinchou who have not discharged recently can be seen shuddering from their electricity. They communicate by flashing their bulbs in specific patterns. For instance, they will flash signals to other Chinchou in the area in order to claim their territories. These Pokémon lives in schools of 20-30 individuals, though numerous groups numbering in the hundreds have been recorded during mating season. During this time, Chinchou head onto land en masse, where they perform intricate mating rituals involving the flashing and waving of their bulbs in patterns. People often come to see these spectacles, splashing Chinchou with water as they trek further inland to keep them hydrated. At the ends of these rituals, pairs of Chinchou head back into the water, lighting up the sea beautifully.","Also known as “Deep-Sea Stars,” the lights of Lanturn are visible from over 3 miles (5 kilometers). This light is produced by bacteria located in the modified dorsal fins on their heads, reacting with a special fluid they produces on their own; this reaction also gives them electrical powers. Lanturn travel in small pods of 3-5 members. When hunting, they lure prey in with light before disorienting victims with quick, brilliant flashes or immobilizing them with paralyzing shocks. They then swallow their prey whole. Lanturn compete with Lumineon for prey. Pods of them swimming in the depths of the ocean’s murky blackness are sometimes seen by fishing boats on the surface. Until recently, these “sea wisps” were an unexplained phenomenon, with theories ranging from secret government submarine vessels to unidentified aquatic aliens. Now, they are commonly used by fishermen to lead their boats; in addition to being adept in the water and providing ample light, Lanturn can also shock fish with electricity and make them easier to catch.","Pichu were the first baby Pokémon recorded to hatch in captivity, by none other than the heralded Johto researcher Professor Elm. As the pre-evolutions of Pikachu, they share many characteristics with them. For example, like Pikachu, Pichu use their cheek pouches to store electricity. However, as baby Pokémon, they are rather inexperienced and are oftentimes unable to hold on to electricity for long periods of time. Pichu almost always discharge all of their electricity in single quick bursts; even laughing too hard can cause them to discharge. This can often be an issue because Pichu tend to be much more energetic and playful when fully charged. They hurt themselves when releasing electricity because they cannot control their shocks. Pichu can knock out adult humans with their uncontrolled bursts. They touch tails with each other as tests of courage, releasing shower of sparks that frighten them and nearly cause them to cry; “brave” Pichu will hold in their tears. Pichu can be seen congregating on days of thunderstorms, charging up in the unusually dry air and making a distinct crackling sound as they do so.","Cleffa are said to land on earth via shooting stars, appearing wherever they land. This legend can be partly attributed to their star-shaped silhouettes; some also believe that they are reborn stars. While their extraterrestrial origins are debatable, it is a fact that their numbers oddly increase on nights following meteor showers. On these nights, Cleffa can be seen dancing in rings as meteors streak across the sky. They dance until dawn and disappear quickly once the last meteor falls. They are almost never seen at any other time and seem to nourish themselves on morning dew that condenses during these rituals. It is said that seeing a ring of Cleffa dancing will bring good luck upon onlookers. Cleffa are drawn to Moon Stones and often hold them while dancing. However, they are more fascinated with rare Comet Shards. Trained Cleffa who come across them will attempt to hoard them, though their rarity makes collections of any more than a dozen unheard of. It is theorized that wild Cleffa colonies have stashes in the hundreds somewhere in the mountains, reconstructing comets to take them home. Cleffa are also entranced by the Pokémon Minior.","Igglybuff have very elastic, rubbery bodies. Their flexibility allows them to take a lot of wear and tear. This property is important, as Igglybuff will often end up in situations that would severely injure most Pokémon. Being rather clumsy, they often trip and fall, rolling down hills and bouncing uncontrollably like balls. Once they begin tumbling, they will not stop until blocked by an obstacle. Luckily, their stretchy bodies protect them from harm during these rolls. Igglybuff love to practice their singing, aspiring to reach the levels of talent of their evolutions. However, due to their underdeveloped vocal cords, they quickly develop sore throats after just a few songs. These Pokémon then will search for water to gargle in order to soothe their voices. These Pokémon practice diligently and sometimes will not stop until their trainers intervene; it is joked that they even dream of singing in their sleep! Igglybuff sweat a scent similar to that of marshmallows (which they are often said to feel like). Researchers are not quite sure why they possess this property; while the smell was once believed to calm foes, studies have shown that it only makes Igglybuff appear more appetizing.","Togepi are often seen as symbols of good luck. Popular culture says that they are able to turn kindness and joy into happiness and presperity, which they then stores in their shells. Togepi will then share these emotions with kind-hearted people. Just being around them can make one feel joyful. Conversely, when surrounded by corrupted people or Pokémon, they become weak due to the lack of “good” energy around them. Togepi, as baby Pokémon, are also known for their low tolerance for hunger. If they become famished, they will cry loudly and incessantly until fed. After eating, they draw themselves entirely into their shells and take long naps. Upon hatching, Togepi view the first living things that they see as their mothers, regardless of species or gender; they will refuse to leave the sides of their parents no matter what. As a result, the majority of trained Togepi are either hatched from eggs or orphaned, since Togepi separated from their “mothers” will refuse to do anything, even intentionally starving themselves (and crying) until their parents find and feed them.","Like Togepi, Togetic are viewed as signs of good fortune, believed to bring luck to anyone they approach. Togetic are also said to be drawn to those pure of heart, rewarding them with showers of “joy dust”; this dust is thought to bring happiness and prosperity to anyone it lands on. Since they obtain much of their livelihood from kind Pokémon and people and are weakened from being around “impure” ones, Togetic fly around the world in search of pure-hearted beings, sharing their joy with them. They can fly for long periods of time without flapping their wings, appearing to levitate. However, it does appear that they must flap every once in a while to keep themselves aloft. The “joy dust” Togetic shower on people is currently being extensively researched by scientists, who are experimenting with its possible use in the future as an antidepressant. The powder has been shown to effectively treat chronic depression in therapy; depressed patients are often partnered with a member of the Togepi line during treatment, which can speed up recovery by weeks.","Because their wings are not yet fully developed, Natu are unable to fly, spending most of their time hopping and skipping around on the ground. They forage for food in shrubs and bushes, occasionally climbing onto branches to peck at shoots. Natu are also fond of cactus plants and can deftly hop between spines to reach the fruit of these plants without injuring themselves. They have surprisingly powerful legs and can launch themselves from the ground into the branches of trees. Natu never blink; they have the habit of staring at objects motionlessly for long periods of time until the objects stir. Many explorers searching for lost ruins are said to have gone insane due to their “hallucinations” of hundreds of eyes staring at them from the jungle’s inky blackness. Natu are also very cautious Pokémon. Some believe that this is due in part to their supposed future-seeing, prophetic abilities. Indeed, many locals in the rainforests Natu call home use them as early warning systems for disasters. When large flocks of Natu flee from an area, people will begin preparing for imminent flash floods or earthquakes.","Xatu are mystic Pokémon that have played prominent roles in the myths of many tropical cultures. Many of these legends involve their ability to see through time. Xatu are believed to see the past through their left eyes and the future through their right ones. What they see is said to frighten them immensely, petrifying them. This myth explains why Xatu sometimes don’t move or blink for long periods of time. Alternatively, some say that Xatu rarely move because they believe their actions are futile in the face of an inevitable future. Others believe that Xatu are prophets from another world or dimension altogether; some even think that they have extraterrestrial origins, explaining how their eyes follow the sun’s movement throughout the day (though few take them seriously even within most conspiracy communities). On the rare occasions that Xatu do move, they simply will raise their wings in patterns to communicate. Prophets trained to read these messages herald them as predictions of the future, which come true with varying degrees of success. Whether this disparity is due to the Xatu’s mistakes or the prophets’ is up to debate.","Mareep are a common sight on farms, raised for their soft, fluffy wool. Their wool is used to make various different articles of clothing like jackets and sweaters, though it must first be treated to reduce its static-generating properties. Their coats grows continuously, but are shed periodically every summer. If sheared, this wool can grow back within a week. Their fur stores pockets of air that insulate them, keeping Mareep warm during colder months are cool during hotter ones. As they wander about, their wool, which generates static very easily, rubs together and begins storing electricity. Their coats will double in size once fully charged. Because touching their wool in this state would lead to a nasty shock, it is necessary for ranch hands to don rubber gloves while shearing or otherwise handling flocks of Mareep. The small orbs at the end of their tails will glow more brightly depending on how much static electricity they have charged up in their wool. Experienced trainers and farm workers will know on sight whether or not a Mareep is safe to touch, depending on the intensity of its bulb.","Upon evolution, Flaaffy develop sections of skin in which wool no longer grows. Their skin, which is bare in these areas, feels like rubber and is nonconductive. Scientists have theorized that this adaptation developed to prevent these Pokémon from harming themselves with their own electricity, which as Mareep, they were prone to do (the reason why Mareep shed so often is to protect themselves from their own static). Flaaffy will also begin to grow bald in patches where static generation is abnormally high. To make up for the smaller quantities of wool on their bodies, Flaaffy wool is much higher in quality and can store more electricity. Because it is softer, this wool is more prized; it is harder to come by and more pricey, though, because Flaaffy don’t shed as often as Mareep. Because of its texture and price tag, Flaaffy wool is very popular among those following cutting-edge fashion. Flaaffy can fire strands of their wool at opponents to electrocute them. They produce static by rubbing their wool together. When they are fully charged, the bulbs at the end of their tails will glow brightly.","Ampharos completely forgo the wool of their pre-evolutions, instead generating electricity completely on their own. Their most famous features are the bulbs on their tails. When lit, the light they emit is so bright that it can be seen from space. Due to this, Ampharos are often employed in lighthouses, like the Glitter Lighthouse in Olivine City, to warn ships of rocky shores. In the past, people also used Ampharos to communicate over long distances. By flashing lights in Morse code, people could send messages to each other “via Ampharos.” In lighthouses, Ampharos are still trained to signal “S.O.S” in Morse to relay emergency signals for people working inside. One can tell the state of an Ampharos’s health by the strength of its tail light. The brighter the light, the healthier the individual. On the other hand. flickering, dimly glowing lights are signals of sickness or exhaustion. In the wild, these Pokémon usually keep their tails unlit to avoid detection from enemies. Lighthouses using Ampharos are legally required to have at least 3 of them at any given time to prevent any of them from being fatigued. ","Bellossom are generally found in tropical jungles, often seen dancing uniformly in circular groups. These dances are said to summon the sun, bringing bright, warm days. They congregate at the end of the rainy season to dance and celebrate. When exposed to ample sunlight, their petal skirts deepen in color and they begin to twirl around. As they dance, their petals rub against each other, creating a pleasing sound. It is said that Bellossom that evolve from stinkier Gloom develop more vibrant flowers. When Bellossom sleep, they close their petals around themselves. Their ​petal skirts and flowers will wilt when deprived of sunlight. During mating season, Bellossom will perform intricate dances with their mates involving jumps and twirls in the air. The males will then release pollen from their flowers as the females lay their eggs in nests of dried grass. The eggs are generally left alone afterwards, though some parents have occasionally been documented in the wild watching over their young.","Marill can be found swimming in various bodies of freshwater as also well as frolicking on lakeshores and riversides. Their spherical tails contain an oil that is less dense than water. They act as buoys when Marill swim, helping them stay afloat even in the roughest currents. The amount of oil in their tails can be regulated to allow the Pokémon to swim at varying depths. Marill feed on algae and small fish at the bottoms of their habitats. Their tails can be seen floating above the surface in shallower bodies of water. Their fur is water-repellant, allowing them to swim with little resistance and therefore with high speed. Their tails are very flexible and stretchy, and their buoys can contract and expand at will.  When fishing, these Pokémon will wrap their tails tightly around nearby trees and leap into the rushing rapids of rivers. After nabbing fish, Marill will pull themselves back onto land with their springy tails. Their ears are highly developed and can pick up minute sounds both above and below the the surface of the water. ","Azumarill have highly sensitive ears, able to discern sounds both on land and underwater. They can single out sources of noise while blocking out all other sounds (like that of rushing rivers). They can stay submerged for long periods of time, from 12 to 16 hours, as they can hold large volumes of air within their bodies. When Azumarill dive, they roll up their long ears to prevent water from getting into them. The bubble patterns on their bellies helps them camouflage while swimming; from above, they blend in with the water, while from below, they disappear into the foam. Azumarill can form durable air bubbles underwater when they spot drowning Pokémon, they will surround them with one of these bubbles to supply them with air as the Pokémon rise to the surface. If they are unable to swim, Azumarill will haul them back to shore in order to ensure their safety. In battle, Azumarill can attack foes with moves such as Aqua Tail and Superpower, and are surprisingly powerful foes for their size.","Sudowoodo are often mistaken for trees or Grass-types—in fact, this is their greatest defense. In reality, Sudowoodo are Rock-types, mimicking trees to camouflage in forests. Their disguises can fool Grass-, Ground, and Water-types into overlooking them. Additionally, they are also resistant to Flying-, Fire-, and Poison-types, which true Grass-types are weak to. They can be found blending in with trees in forests and parks. Despite their mimicry, however, a few key tell-tale signs can help trainers distinguish ordinary trees from hidden Sudowoodo. On windless days, trees whose branches shudder erratically are often Sudowoodo. After a fresh fall of winter snow, trees that are oddly bare while their surroundings are blanketed in white are also likely Sudowoodo. Finally, Sudowoodo are very hydrophobic—they are deathly afraid of water. They will charge out of hiding if exposed to the substance. If they even sense rain, they will immediately seek shelter elsewhere. Their arms are quite strong, yet flexible, allowing them to hold them up for incredibly long periods of time. Sudowoodo seem to be popular amongst the elderly, who are very particular about their arm lengths and angles; those with larger green orbs are more desirable.","Politoed are jovial Pokémon, often seen clapping and hopping around ponds. They congregate in triplets or quartets (colloquially known as “choruses”) and sing together; their harsh croaking sounds like rumbling bellows or even screaming when they do so. Despite this, there is a famous Johto composer who wrote a haunting ballad based on the soudns of a Politoed chorus. Lone Politoed are often the heads of local communities of Poliwag and Poliwhirl, commanding them sternly with their croaks. The curls on their heads are symbols of dominance. When their positions are challenged by intruding or recently-evolved Politoed, the ones with larger curls ultimately become the leaders. Politoed with short curls or curls lost in battle have been observed to command little to no respect from their peers; their bellows will simply be ignored. Politoed are equally adept in the water as they are on land. Because of their porous skin, they must return into the water at least once every 24 hours in order to rehydrate themselves. When choruses of least four Politoed are observed singing together, it is said that rainstorms are imminent. Their cheeks will also inflate slightly before drizzles. ","Hoppip are common sights on breezy days, floating in the wind with their leaves whirling idly. Their light bodies can be picked up by breezes, letting them follow the winds. Their feet are capable of gripping onto the ground tightly to avoid being blown away. However, they are not suitable for walking, leaving wind as their main form of locomotion. Hoppip also gather in large clusters for stability during strong gales, linking their leaves together to form tightly-interwoven chains. These clusters can number anywhere from 10 to 100, with colonies of over a thousand having been reported during strong tropical windstorms. Clusters that are blown loose may float aimlessly across the sky like aerial tumbleweeds. Due to their docile natures, Hoppip unfortunately make easy prey for many predators. However, the leaves on their heads are unimaginably bitter, so few dare to consume them. It is said that their astringency can linger in the mouth for a week, and no amount of purging can remove or mask the taste. ","Skiploom have flowers that spin like pinwheels as they float across the sky. They ride the wind to get closer to the sun, where their petals will open to allow them to absorb sunlight and photosynthesize. Depending on the temperature, their flowers will open up to various degrees; they fully bloom at 64°F (18°C). Because of this, some trainers use Skiploom as natural thermometers, gauging the air temperature based on how open their flowers are. In particularly cold weather, their flowers close up completely and their floating abilities are severely hampered. Excessive water can also be detrimental to Skiploom. Because they cannot remain airborne when soaked, they will hide in the shade of trees during rainfalls to avoid getting wet. They are naturally easygoing and friendly Pokémon. Skiploom rarely attack, even when threatened, instead preferring to escape on the next breeze. However, they are capable of incapacitating foes when necessary with debilitating moves such as Stun Spore, Sleep Powder, and Leech Seed.","Upon evolution, Jumpluff finally gain control of their flight paths. Rather than simply floating aimlessly in the wind, they can direct their cotton puffs to float in whatever direction and speed they choose. They are capable of withstanding strong gales and are able to circumnavigate the world on sustained trade winds. As winter approaches, Jumpluff soar in large clusters across oceans on southern winds, landing whenever they encounter cooler breezes. Because they are very agile, they prefer to escape confrontation on the wind rather than confront foes. However, should they for whatever reason  be unable to escape, they can utilize the move Cotton Spore to slow down opponents, buying them time to flee. During mating season, Jumpluff of both genders (or just the males in captivity) begin releasing spores from their puffs. Male spores will fertilize female eggs, which they will lay in covered piles of leaves. Female spores can also develop independently into Hoppip, though these are genetically identical to their mothers.","Aipom make their homes in tall treetops, rarely descending to the ground--in fact, some individuals live their whole lives without ever touching the forest floor. Aipom use their prehensile tails to swing from tree branch to tree branch, using momentum to leap around. They can suspend their entire bodies and latch onto branches with just their tails. These tails are highly dextrous, able to manipulate objects around them as tools. Young Aipom, for example, may play-fight each other with makeshift “swords” fashioned from branches and leaves. Older Aipom can be seen whittling down wood to form rudimentary stakes, useful for spearing into the hard shells of some fruits, nuts, and Berries. In Alola, their favorite prey is in fact the hapless Bounsweet. Aipom use their tails to grab hard-to-reach fruit in trees, and may even shake some fruit off of their branches for younger Aipom below to enjoy. Their tails are also used to keep them balanced. Aipom use their tails so extensively and exclusively, in fact, that their true hands have become vestigial and more or less useless over many years of evolution.","Sunkern are among the weakest of all currently known Pokémon. Most members of the species are aware of this--Sunkern rarely ever move, conserving all the nutrients they obtain from sunlight and dewdrops (the only things that Sunkern consume, as they don’t eat) in preparation for evolution. In fact, if attacked, they likely will only attempt to shake their leaves weakly at their opponents. They often will seek shelter and protection within treetops, nestling themselves in the nooks and crannies of branches and leaves. In the morning, Sunkern can commonly be seen dropping ​down onto the ground out of the blue, blown off by strong breezes. They rely almost entirely on the sun, its light, and its warmth to supply the primary factors in their growths. During cooler, cloudier summers, Sunkern will go into hibernation and seem to disappear entirely. Then, the following year, if the summer weather improves, Sunkern populations will appear to explode as masses of hibernating Sunkern reawaken to bask in the warm sunlight.","Sunflora are diurnal Pokémon; their activity follows the position of the sun in the sky. In the morning, Sunflora begin to stir, opening their petals and turning to face the rising sun. In the afternoon, when the sun is highest in the sky, they move around actively, almost frantically, following the sun as it travels. They slow down again at sunset; then, when night falls, Sunflora close their petals and become completely immobile, repeating the cycle again the next day. The color of a Sunflora’s petals also reflects the sun. The brighter and warmer the sunlight that shines on it is, the more vivid its petals become. Oddly, this reaction does not occur when Sunflora are exposed to artificial sunlight, instead only happening when they are bathed in the unfiltered, natural light of the sun. Sunflora subsist almost entirely on sunlight and water, photosynthesizing sugars to create energy for themselves. Though they acquire some trace nutrients by absorbing them from the soil that they tread upon, they obtain the bulk of their consumed energy from the sun. ","Yanma are some of the most agile fliers in the world. They can fly in any direction: forwards, backwards, up, down, left, and right; they can even hover in place. They flap their wings extremely quickly; to defend themselves, Yanma can increase the speed of their flapping to generate shock waves and stun foes. These waves are strong enough to shatter glass windows. Their compound eyes can turn 360°, allowing them to see in virtually any direction. This is useful when Yanma are hunting their preferred prey--insects. Yanma are very territorial against other Yanma, defending their domains from intruders with attacks like Sonic Boom and Bug Buzz. They primarily reside in humid swamps and marshes, though they can also be found in damper woodlands. Yanma catch insects in their strong mandibles, oftentimes grabbing them out of the air mid-flight and carrying them back to their nests to feed upon in private. They use the two long growths on either end of their tails to remain balanced as they quickly dart around in search of food.","Wooper make their homes in cooler areas of fresh water. Though they prefer brisk rivers and ponds, they have a low tolerance for icy waters and subzero temperatures. As amphibians, Wooper are able to survive both in water and on land. In fact, they alter their hunting patterns from water to land based on the weather; when it is cooler, such as in the evening, Wooper will hunt terrestrially, but when it is warmer, like during the day, they will hunt aquatically. They cover themselves with a slimy film to stay moist outside of the water. This film is poisonous; Wooper will often leave trails of this slime walking around on land. While contact this film can cause searing pain, it is not fatal. The growths on the sides of their heads are in fact gills; individuals with larger gills are considered more attractive to mates. When resting, Wooper will bury themselves in the sand to hide from predators. Some populations have been observed to cease development in this form, never evolving into Quagsire during their lifespans.","Quagsire are famous for their lax and easygoing natures. They rarely move; when they do, though, they swim in slow and relaxed manners. Quagsire will often bump into nearby objects as they swim, including boulders and boat hulls. However, they are unfazed by these collisions, in part due to their strong skulls. Even when hunting, Quagsire remain at ease. They don’t move in search of food; instead, they simply remain in one place and hold their mouths agape, waiting for unwary prey to swim through. Then, they just close their mouths to catch their food. Although it isn’t a terribly efficient manner of hunting, this technique suffices for Quagsire since they expend very little energy in the first place. Though their bodies are just as slimy as those of Wooper, Quagsire slime is not poisonous like that of their pre-evolutions. Scientists believe that Wooper poison is simply a temporarily evolutionary development adapted by the species to protect themselves while still young and vulnerable.","Eevee who feel a particularly strong emotion and are active during the day evolve into Espeon. Espeon are skilled at prediction, able to foretell events before they occur. When their forked tails quiver, they are deep in thought conjecturing what will happen next. Their superfine fur, which feels like velvet, can detect minute air currents and help them predict the attacks of foes. Some say they can even read the thoughts of enemies in a similar fashion. This ability to detect air currents also makes Espeon reliable forecasters of the weather. Their large ears aid them in their predictions, allowing them to hear the slightest sounds. Espeon are extremely loyal to their trainers. They will not hesitate to defend them with the powerful Psychic if necessary. The gems on their heads glow when they use their abilities, and are in fact said to be the source of their powers. They will dull when Espeon are weakened or ill. In popular culture, Espeon are connected with the sun and daylight, likely due to their conditions for evolution. It is said that it gathers psychic energy in its gem through sunbathing, making them poor battlers in the dark of night.","Eevee who become particularly passionate and prefer the night will evolve into Umbreon. Umbreon naturally stir feelings of unease in those around them. They lurk in darkness, luring inprey and unsettling them simply by their mere presences. Just before they attack, their rings will glow dimly. These rings react in the presence of moonlight, glowing faintly when exposed to it; Umbreon seem to become stronger under these conditions. They glow brightest under a full moon, coincidentally also the time when Umbreon are the strongest. The rings will also glow when Umbreon experience strong emotions like happiness or anger. When agitated, Umbreon will sweat a poisonous substance from their pores and spray it in the eyes of foes, paralyzing them in minutes. They aim for the throats of prey when hunting. They are very protective of their trainers and will chase aggressors with Pursuit. Many associate Umbreon with the moon and nighttime, considering their evolutionary conditions and purported ability to draw power from moonlight.","Murkrow are reputed to be bringers of ill fortune. They enjoy playing pranks on passerby, though their definitions of “prank” may be more sinister than the traditional one. Murkrow will aggravate travelers into chasing them and then lead them down winding paths in dark forests before simply flying away, leaving them stranded and lost in the middle of nowhere. Urban Murkrow play similar tricks on people in dark alleyways in sketchy neighborhoods. They enjoy collecting shiny things; there are reports of Murkrow swooping down from the sky and snatching rings right off the hands of newlyweds. This puts them in direct competition with another urban thief, Meowth. The two often steal from each other’s hoards. People who come across either of their stashes will commonly find stolen objects dating back decades. In badlands, they are also known to infiltrate  Gabite hoards in search of treasure. Murkrow are often underlings for their evolutions Honchkrow, stealing for their their bosses’ hoards. Because they are nocturnal, parents often warn their children to “get home before the Murkrow fly.”","Unlike their pre-evolutions, Slowking are extremely intellectual, on par with the world’s leading scientists. However, they maintain the calm demeanors of Slowpoke and can remain cool and collected in nearly any situation. Scientists think that the toxin secreted into their brains by the transformed Shellder latched on their heads is the source of their brainpower. Every time Slowking yawn, the attached Shellder inject more toxin into their brains, increasing their thinking capacities. Slowking enjoy conducting research, often managing their own studies separately from their trainers. When they have intuitive thoughts, the gems on their shells will light up. Curiously, their knowledge appears to somehow be stored in the Shellder on their heads; if these Shellder ever become dislodged and fall off, Slowking lose all the information they had learned from their studies, reverting to the same intellectual level as Slowpoke; reattaching the Shellder will restore their wit. Humorously, some say that a vestige of Slowpoke's dimwittedness remains, and Slowking are cursed to always forget truly world-changing ideas as soon as another dawns on them. Some island cultures worship Slowking as all-knowing shamans, referring to them as \"sages of the sea\". They are known to engage in what seem to be battles of wit or discussions with Oranguru, which usually end in draws.","Misdreavus live in dark, dreary forests and caves. They startle unwary travelers to feed on their fear, which they store in the red orbs around their necks. It is said that one can hear shrieking emanating from these orbs if one sets his or her ears next to them. In order to elicit the emotions they require to feed, Misdreavus may try a variety of tactics. The simplest trick they use is materializing right in front of travelers to startle them. Other ploys include pulling hair, lighting up their orbs in total darkness, and laughing maniacally under cover of the night. Their most famous tactic, however, is letting loose unearthly howls, screams, cries, or wails that can be heard for miles, thoroughly disturbing any living beings that are unfortunate enough to hear them. Misdreavus appear to take pleasure in creating mischief, sometimes playing tricks on others just for fun and not even feeding on the subsequent emotions that they cause. Conversely, they can get upset when confronted with individuals that they are unable to scare. They are solely nocturnal and will sleep in dark caves and tree hollows during the day. In fact, Misdreavus appear to be actively harmed by rays of sunlight, becoming extremely lethargic and dull when exposed to it.","Unown are very odd Pokémon. They are often found stuck to the walls of ancient ruins, flying off and orbiting each other when touched or otherwise disturbed. Unown come in 28 different forms, each resembling a letter of the Latin alphabet (and two resembling punctuation marks); it is unknown whether Unown or the written language came first. Ancient hieroglyphs found in ruins seem to indicate the former, as the carvings appeared to mimic the body shapes of the different forms of Unown. Unown appear to act with a hive mind, though researchers are not yet sure how they communicate, though electromagnetic waves and telepathy seem to be the most likely candidates. A single Unown is rather weak alone, but when two or more are near each other, strange phenomena begin to occur. Reports of reality warping, wish-granting, and other bizarre activities have been traced back to large swarms of Unown. These Pokémon are believed to be connected with many elusive legendaries, as well as the mysterious secrets of the universe itself.","Wobbuffet almost never attack foes without provocation. In fact, they prefer to avoid confrontation entirely, sheltering themselves away from most other Pokémon. They hate light and shock, living in dark caves and forests that receive almost no light at all. When Wobbuffet are attacked, they inflate themselves and counter; even so, they won’t attack again unless their foes are unwise enough to attack twice. Their unconfrontational natures can have rather humorous side effects. Wobbuffet are territorial Pokémon, but will refuse to attack unless struck first. Thus, when two Wobbuffet meet, they will have a stand-off of sorts, refusing to budge before the other. Such duels quickly become fasting contests. One notable exception to their passiveness is when it comes to defending their tails. They will ferociously attack anyone who threatens them and will go to great lengths to keep them concealed in darkness (such as only leaving their caves at night). It is said these tails hold some sort of deep secret about Wobbuffet.","Girafarig are most well-known for their two heads--an actual head and a rear head--both of which have their own separate brains. The brains in their true heads are far more developed and are the main source of their psychic powers; their rear heads are rather primitive and can only focus on one object at a time. The two brains appear to be connected in some manner. When Girafarig graze on grass and tree shoots, their rear heads mimic the chewing motions the true heads make even though they aren’t actually eating anything. Similar behavior can be observed when Girafarig vocalize, spit, yawn, or otherwise use their mouths. Though the rear heads have rudimentary brains, they also have very well-developed senses of smell. They react to particularly alluring scents by lashing out and biting. This enables Girafarig to fend from threats approaching from behind. Their rear heads don’t need sleep. Thus, they are able to keep watch and defend against enemies even when the main heads are resting.","Pineco make their homes under the branches of trees, attaching themselves with a sticky, resinous fluid they produce from their bodies. They also uses this fluid to attach pieces of tree bark to themselves, creating thicker, makeshift shells that protect them from avian Pokémon who mistake them for actual pinecones. Older individuals can construct huge shells this way, with some surrounding themselves with so much bark that the branches supporting them begin to sag or even break. Pineco don’t move much, sticking to the same branch until evolution. They remain sedentary and feed upon unsuspecting insects that land on the bark surrounding them and become trapped in the sticky fluid they secrete. This resin is fragrant, smelling like the pine trees they are often found on. Multiple Pineco can often be found living in a single tree, sometimes even on the same branches. When such trees are disturbed, Pineco are known to drop off of their branches in order to defend their neighbors. They can spontaneously ignite their resin and explode, sending pieces of their bark casings everywhere like shrapnel.","Forretress have shells that are steel-hard. Like Pineco, they are largely sessile, living out their lives almost entirely in a single tree. However, while Pineco prefer to live in branches, Forretress makes their homes in the nooks and crannies of tree trunks. They are insectivores, catching bugs that are attracted to the scent of Pineco resin around them. Forretress can no longer produce this rein themselves, however, so they are always found within trees of Pineco colonies. Researchers are baffled by the contents of their shells. Forretress carapaces are impenetrable even by the marvels of modern science. They only crack open just barely wide enough to catch prey, and do it so quickly that the motion is practically invisible to the naked eye. Though Forretress can still explode like Pineco, they prefer to defend themselves with Spikes. Their shells naturally chip from outside weather conditions--by periodically spinning rapidly, they can dislodge sharp, broken pieces of their shells onto the ground below to deter predators from approaching. This maneuver is in fact a defensive reflex that triggers instinctually whenever Forretress are startled.","Dunsparce are troglobites, living out their entire lives in pitch-black caves (some populations are confirmed to be trogloxines, sometimes venturing outside their caverns). They are very nearly blind, using the two protrusions on the undersides of their lower jaws to feel their way around in total darkness. When threatened, they will burrow backwards into the earth using their drill-like tails. Dunsparce form very intricate subterranean nests, living in in colonies (called “broods”) numbering in the hundreds. Predators who are able to follow Dunsparce down their holes as they burrow to escape will be met with near-inescapable mazes of intersecting tunnels. In some regions, they even cohabitate peacefully with Diglett and share their tunnel networks. Dunsparce also have pairs of vestigial wing growths located on their backs. Though they are very weak, Dunsparce can be trained to float a few centimeters off the ground for several seconds by flapping these growths furiously. However, they are unable to actually take off and fly in the air, and are normally left very exhausted by the sheer effort required to even lift slightly off of the ground.","Gligar cling to steep cliffsides when resting, digging their pincers and claws into the rocky mountainside to hold on. They travel by gliding on favorable winds; though they can journey very far with this method, they are unable to truly “fly” like most avians, and do not flap their “wings” like them either. Gligar live in colonies of roughly a dozen individuals, all nesting on the same cliff. To hunt, Gligar soar in search of suitable prey, dropping down below when they find some. Then, they stretch out all of their limbs and dive at the faces of their victims. They latch on with their pincers and then use their stingers to inject poison and paralyze prey; then, they carry their meals back to their nests without resistance. Gligar can glide perfectly silently, so their victims often never see them coming. Trained Gligar are known to use this face-hugging habit as a form of affection with their trainers, sans the digging of claws into the flesh and the injection of poison into their trainers’ foreheads (though there have been some accidents reported).","While Onix form subterranean tunnels dozens of meters below the surface, Steelix have been recorded to dig out trails nearly a kilometer underground. The immense pressure of the earth above at this level can crush most living organisms. However, their bodies are in fact harder than diamond, compressed by the extreme pressure of their habitats. A common legend is that Onix living to be over 100 years will have experienced enough force to compress their bodies and become Steelix. In the wild, scientists believe that age has little to do with their evolutions; Onix evolve into Steelix as they eat through rock and absorb the iron within. Combined with intense pressure, their bodies eventually turn dense and metallic (such a process can be domestically replicated with Metal Coats). Their eyes are adapted to see in the dark, and their strong jaws can crunch through even the hardest boulders. Their bodies are speckled with thousands of tiny, reflective particles from the minerals they eat. These particles sparkle beautifully in the sun.","Snubbull are popular pets among women, particularly the wealthy and elderly. Considered “cute” by some, they are more commonly described as “hostile-looking.” Indeed, Snubbull are known to bare their fangs and use Scary Face often. However, this in fact appears to be their instinctive reaction to a variety of different stimuli—fear and aggression, obviously, but also embarrassment, boredom, and general discomfort. Unfortunately for Snubbull, though, their expressions often drive other Pokémon away from them, leaving them sad and dejected. Snubbull are in fact affectionate and playful, which is why they are such popular pets. They are also easily scared or bullied; though they may bare their fangs to scare foes, they will flee and cower if they remain undeterred. Snubbull have keen senses of both smell and hearing; they often use these skills to track down “gifts” for their owners, ranging from food scraps to smaller Pokémon that they can pull with their mouths. Snubbull are heavy sleepers, dozing for 12 hours each day. These Pokémon have made a resurgence in popular with younger generations, who seem to be amused by the disparity between their appearances and their personalities.","Granbull, as the saying goes, are “all bark and no bite.” They threaten foes by opening their mouths wide and baring their fangs, which is enough to send most foes fleeing in fear. However, if the confrontation continues, they will cower and run away. If cornered, rather than attacking, they will simply flail their limbs about wildly. They avoid actual fighting unless absolutely necessary. Their bites, however, are in fact extremely powerful, strong enough to crush concrete. There is one situation, though, where Granbull will attack ferociously: when their loved ones are threatened. If their offspring, friends, or other that Granbull care for are threatened, they will attack in blind rages against the offenders. This curious aspect of their personalities--docile unless they sense threats--make them great guards within domestic homes. However, they are far less useful when defending properties, as they will avoid conflict if no lives are at stake. Still, their loyalty makes them popular pets. Their fangs are so heavy that they can sometimes be seen with their heads leaned over from the sheer weight of their jaws. Conversely, Granbull can also be seen tilting their heads backwards to counteract this weight.","Qwilfish swim in the open ocean, far away from the shore. They are extremely poisonous; anything pierced by their sharp spines will be injected a their paralyzing toxins, which can knock an adult man unconscious within seconds. These spikes are in fact specialized scales, which hardened and became sharper over time through evolution. To defend themselves, Qwilfish quickly swallow large amounts of water (2.6 gallons on average) and inflate themselves to up to twice their original sizes, hoping to match their foes in stature. In this state, they can launch the spikes off of their bodies to spear and inject enemies with their toxins. While inflated, however, Qwilfish experience much trouble swimming; though they are already not very good swimmers when deflated, they often will fail to move at all when fully inflated, simply floating along in the ocean currents until they expel all of their water. Qwilfish are territorial and will engage in inflation contests to see who can grow the largest. Generally, individuals float away in currents before winners can be determined.","Also known as the Scissors Pokemon, Scizor have exoskeletons made out a material as hard as titanium. Their pincers are strong enough to pulverize stone, and in fact contain an alloy very similar to actual steel; they are actually more suited to pummeling foes than grasping them. Scizor are calculated, relentless hunters that will not let prey flee once spotted. The eyespots on them make them resemble second and third heads; Scizor wave theses claws around while opening and closing them in order to intimidate foes. Upon evolution from Scyther, Scizor lose their ability to fly. Instead, they use their wings to regulate their body temperatures, flapping at varying speeds to warm themselves up or cool themselves down. Though rare in the wild, they can occasionally be found living solitarily in grasslands and forests; they dislike tropical climates, unlike Scyther. Also unlike their pre-evolutions, Scizor don’t dwell in packs and will stake out large swathes of land for themselves. They will duel with other Scizor and Scyther packs to protect their territories. Scyther that evolve in the wild are immediately shunned from their packs, forced to find their own land and fend for themselves.","Shuckle live among rocks within cracks and crevices. They secrete a corrosive fluid from their feet that can dissolve holes into boulders, tucking themselves in and withdrawing their limbs for safety in their makeshift shelters. Their shells are made of one of the hardest substances known to man,and can weather most kinds of damage: physical attacks, weather, acids, flames, and electric shocks all fail to scratch their shells. To avoid damage, Shuckle tuck themselves into their shells and remain perfectly still. They subsist on diets of only Berries. One of their most curious properties is their ability to create potent elixirs by fermenting Berries in their shells. When they find Berries, they store some within their shells. They then begin to decompose, ferment, and mix with their own bodily fluids to become a pulpy liquid. Depending on the type of Berries stored, the resulting juice can have a variety of interesting effects. One of the most common is known simply as Berry Juice, replenishing the health of Pokémon who drink it.","Heracross live within forests, feeding on tree sap and honey. Their most famous features are their large horns, which they use to defend themselves from foes. In battle, Heracross can use their horns to toss foes far away. They dig their sharp claws into tree bark before slipping under the grasps of enemies and sliding their horns underneath. Then, they throw their foes with forces capable of moving objects over a 100 times their body weight. Alternatively, they may charge at foes to frighten them before tossing them away. Heracross take strong pride in their horns. When fighting for territory, dominance or mates, Heracross will engage in duels, horns against horns. The individuals with the larger horns generally emerge as the victors. In Alola, they also compete with Vikavolt in addition to other Heracross. Their exoskeletons are very tough, able to withstand even the strongest blows. Heracross are very docile Pokémon, content doing nothing more than eating tree sap all day. However, they will quickly become aggressive should something interrupt their feeding, and will charge relentlessly at distractions with their horn. Though capable of flight, they are clumsy in the air and can only stay aloft for short periods of time.","Sneasel are sly, Pokémon that live in cold areas. Their hands and feet are padded with soft fur that silences their footsteps. They retract their claws while stalking prey to ensure they aren’t heard. They hunts in pairs for their favorite food: Pidgey eggs. First, one Sneasel will scare off the parents guarding the nests by silently approaching and then jumping out, extending its claws to scare them away. Then, the second will climb up the tree by digging its sharp claws into the bark, stealthily taking the eggs while the parents are startled. Breeders despise Sneasel for their egg-eating natures. Though cooperative when hunting, pairs are known to engage in disputes when it comes to sharing the haul. Sneasel are also known to occasionally scavenge, ripping pieces of flesh from the meals of other Pokémon. They are nocturnal, preferring to hunt in the cover of night. Sneasel are also cunning; they are known to closely observe enemies from the darkness to pinpoint their most vulnerable points before leaping out and digging their claws into those areas. Sneasel in pairs may gang up on single foes, using Beat Up to claw them into submission.","Teddiursa are almost always found with their hands held to their mouths. This is because they are infatuated with the taste of honey, enjoying it so much that they soaks their paws in the substance until they are saturated and they can lick honey from them at their leisure. Teddiursa actually create their own honey out of Beedrill pollen and fruit nectar. Each individual has its own taste preferences, and will have different “recipes” to suit their tastes. As such, no two sets of Teddiursa paws will taste the same. When they find honey in the wild, the crescent marks on their heads will glow. However, they do not immediately eat found honey. Instead, they store it in a variety of different hiding places. This practice helps them keep steady food supplies during cold winters when sustenance is scarce. Though Teddiursa don’t hibernate like Ursaring, they do become noticeably less active during the winter. In the wild, they will hole up in caves near one of their hidden stashes when the weather turns cold, waiting patiently for spring to arrive.","Ursaring are also known as the Hibernant Pokémon. They mark their territories by scratching claw marks into trees. They defend their domains fiercely, and will not hesitate to maul unwary trespassers. Generally, though, they will leave human travelers alone unless provoked. Exceptions arise during mating season, when Ursaring become highly aggressive and agitated. They also defend their young very ferociously, so travelers should be cautious of approaching young Teddiursa; their parents may in fact be nearby. Ursaring are highly competent at climbing trees. When searching for Berries--their favorite food--however, they prefer to simply snap trees in half and pick up fallen ones from the ground. They prefer to sleep high up in treetops. Ursaring also have keen senses of smell, able to distinguish most scents and find food buried deep underground. They are annual hibernators; in the winter, they lie dormant in their dens for months. Curiously, the circles on their chests glow faintly in the moonlight.","Thin, transparent skin actually covers the bodies of Slugma. Instead of blood, however, their circulatory systems pump molten-hot lava to transport vital nutrients and minerals throughout their bodies. This lava bubbles out of small pores in their skin, leaving trails of the substance as they move around. Because of this unique system, Slugma can only live for extended periods of time in very warm areas, particularly volcanoes. Should they stop moving in cooler places, the lava within their bodies will begin to harden, become brittle, and crumble. The cooler Slugma are, the slower they will move, until they stop moving altogether. In areas where lava and magma are common, large groups of Slugma, sometimes numbering in the hundreds, can be seen congregating where the lava oozes out. In order to remain healthy, Slugma must dip themselves in lava or magma every so often to replenish the lava lost from traveling. Some Poké Marts sell a lava substitute specifically for Slugma and Magcargo, which is both nontoxic and safe to the touch.","Though the shells of Magcargo appear to be solid and rock-hard, they are in fact simply thin shells of cooled lava (like skins of sorts); they break at the slightest touch. Luckily, this does not harm Magcargo, as new lava will simply rise to the top and harden into new shells. Flames periodically spurt from small cracks in their shells; this is their way of disposing of waste, combusting it within their molten shells. Their bodies can reach temperatures of 18,000°F (10,000°C), hot enough to vaporize water on contact. When it rains, their mere presence can create thick fog that can blanket areas within seconds. Like Slugma, Magcargo gradually lose some of their lava and become smaller through simple locomotion as they leave trails. They can return to their original sizes by taking dips in magma pools. Trained Magcargo can also use the lava substitutes sold at some Poké Marts with no ill effects. Magcargo are almost only found in active volcanic craters, leading some scientists to believe that they adapted their molten bodies to cope with their environment.","Swinub have very keen senses of smell. They are often trained to locate rare mushrooms that only grow underground. In the wild, Swinub use their smell to forage for their favorite food—truffles. Swinub also have a talent for sniffing out concealed hot springs under ice. Though they themselves have little use for such springs, they do enjoy grazing on the plant life that grows around them. Ski resorts and inns often are built near areas with large numbers of Swinub, banking on the hopes that there are hot springs nearby to draw in tourists. Swinub have rather poor vision, relying mostly on their noses to find their way. When they smell something particularly enticing, they will dash quickly towards it, unaware of any obstacles in their way. Their thick coats of long fur keep them warm on the ice, insulating them from the cold. Although their favorite food is mushrooms, they aren’t very picky eaters and will consume nearly anything edible that they manage to locate with their noses.","Piloswine have thick coats of fur that keep them insulated even in the subzero temperatures of their natural habitats. However, it also has the side effect of essentially blinding them by covering their eyes, feet, and bodies. Like Swinub, Piloswine rely largely on their very powerful senses of smell to navigate. However, they also have highly developed senses of hearing. They can sound small grunts or snorts and then listen to the returning echoes to locate objects around them. If they sense disturbances, the hairs on their bodies will stand straight; they will also charge in the direction of the sound. Because of their poor vision, they may continue charging repeatedly in the same course, not noticing when foes have moved for a few seconds. Their tusks become harder after fresh snowfalls. Piloswine use these tusks to fend off enemies and dig up food from beneath the frost. Though their legs are short and stubby, their fur-concealed hooves are very rugged, preventing them from skidding as they charge across slippery ice.","Corsola are most well-known for their horns, which collectors prize as jewelry. Treated Corsola horns can refract light in the seven colors of the rainbow. In some regions, these harvested horns are considered fertility charms. Luckily, Corsola shed their horns periodically to grow new ones, giving collectors an ample supply of discarded horns to work with. This process can happen in as little as one to three nights. Corsola can only survive in pristine, warm waters. They migrate south as temperatures cools through the year. Corsola use their horns to filter water and obtain nutrients; in polluted or cold seas, their horns lose their color, become brittle, and disintegrate. Corsola live in colonies, shedding their horns to create natural reefs. Other Pokémon often make their homes in these reefs. Notably, Pacifidlog Town, Hoenn, is a village in the middle of the ocean built entirely on a Corsola colony. Corsola populations can be used as a water quality detector. If they begin to appear sickly, it is a sign that the water is dirty. Corsola also shed their horns as distractions against predators like Mareanie. Corsola populations in Alola, where Mareanie are most common, have stubbier horns as a result, though the tropical waters also make them much more vibrant and healthy overall.","Remoraid begin their lives in the sea. Upon hatching, they are largely unable to find hunt on their own. Instead, they use the suction pad-like fins on their heads to attach to the undersides of Mantine. There, they can consume scraps that drift past them while the Mantine are feeding. They will also defend the Mantine when they are endangered in order to keep their hosts safe. Once they are old enough to find food for themselves, they travel into freshwater rivers. Remoraid hunt by hiding just beneath the river’s surface and shooting out bullets of water at unsuspecting insects above. They can shoot up to 300 feet (91 m) away with amazing accuracy, even at moving targets. To do this, Remoraid squeeze their abdominal muscles to expel small pellets of water from their mouth. They also use this trick to escape from foes, propelling themselves backwards with the recoil. These “shots” even work underwater, striking foes from crevices on the riverbed or sea floor. As evolution approaches, Remoraid will swim downstream in large numbers back into the ocean, where they will stay for the rest of their lives. In Alola, the Remoraid population is fact entirely maritime, breeding and developing solely in the ocean; there, they are known as the \"snipers of the sea.\"","Octillery are marine Pokémon, though some freshwater populations have also been reported. They are clever, developing a variety of different hunting tactics to capture prey. Some Octillery hide under rocks or small caves with only their mouth sticking out. Then, when targets pass by, they squirt ink to blind them and drag them into their holes. Others prefer to bash prey with their rock-hard heads to stun them before capture. As a third option, some Octillery strangle their foes with their tentacles, which have powerful suction cups to prevent prey from escaping. If they grab victims that turn out to be too strong, though, they will squirt ink and attempt to escape. They can use Octazooka to blind foes and buy time to flee. It has recently been discovered that this ink also contains a compound that dulls olfactory senses, hindering predators that hunt by smell as well as sight. In some regions, Octillery ink is also used as a culinary ingredient and food dye. Octillery instinctually hide in the crevices of boulders, nesting in these cracks and even stealing the nests of other Octillery if they are in more favorable positions. Octillery will bash heads with each other to fight for nests; these fights can be dirty, involving copious amounts of ink and tentacles.","Delibird make their nests inside mountain crags and atop sheer cliffs. Male and female Delibird mate for life. While females stay with their young to keep watch, males spend the day looking for food, which they roll up and store within their sack-like tails to bring home. Delibird are very kind to strangers; if they comes across lost Pokémon or trainers, they won’t hesitate to share some of their food with them. Many hikers in near-death situations can recount being saved by generous Delibird. Delibird are also curious Pokémon; besides food, they also collect pretty, strange, and sometimes even dangerous objects within their tails. They will gladly share their loot with others--for example, giving lost hikers compasses to help them find their way. Because they give away so much, though, they are constantly waddling about in search of more food. Their generous reputations have made them symbols of various holidays centered around gift-giving. As Delibird are omnivorous, however, their definition of \"food\" when gifting can sometimes include insects or other unusual foodstuffs. When threatened, Delibird defend themselves by using Present, chucking the contents of their tails at attackers. Projectiles include food, rocks, and even explosives--whatever Delibird have found on their travels. In a flock, the Delibird with the largest tail is the leader.","Mantine are very calm, docile Pokémon. They are often found with Remoraid attached under one of their wings. The two Pokemon have a mutualistic relationship; the Remoraid, usually young and unable to hunt for themselves, feed off of scraps from their hosts’ meals, and the Mantine in turn get periodically cleaned as the Remoraid consume detritus and food scraps from their bodies. They are usually swim slowly, gliding gently through the water and eating anything that happens to float into their mouths. However, they are able to reach very high speeds; in fact, one can sometimes see small schools of Mantine accelerating just under the water’s surface before leaping out and becoming airborne. Mantine can soar for over 300 feet (91 meters) in the way. Though they appear smooth, their bodies actually feel coarse, having accumulated detritus while flying through the water. This is why it is healthy for Mantine to have Remoraid attached to them in the wild; they protect the Mantine from parasites and disease and keep them from being weighed down by detritus. In Alola, Mantine surfing is a popular pastime, and the Pokémon is a popular symbol of the island chain.","Skarmory make their nests in bramble bushes. Though born with soft skin, they quickly callous and harden through the constant scratching of their prickly nests. Their wings and bones are actually hollow, allowing them to fly at speeds of up to 185 mph (300 km/h). They are also razor-sharp; in the past, warriors used to brandish their fallen feathers as swords and knives. Even today, some chefs utilize artisanal knives sharpened from Skarmory feathers. These feathers grow back annually, replacing old ones bruised and battered from battle. Skarmory are highly aggressive and territorial, engaging in vicious battles over disputed land. They will rip off wings and feathers from foes with their sharp beaks or talons to send them plummeting to the ground. Skarmory are known to kidnap small, defenseless Pokémon from their trainers or parents in hopes of luring larger prey seeking to retrieve them back to their nests. They have even been observed tearing off the limbs of weaker creatures or chasing them off cliffs simply for fun. Because their water can rust their wings, Skarmory seek shelter in brambles during the rain.","Houndour live and hunt in packs. They are extremely loyal to each other; if one member of a pack is attacked, the others will gang up on the foe. Packs of Houndour each develop their own unique sets of calls. When hunting, they use these calls to alert each other of their locations. Then, they work together to corner their prey; they have demonstrated to be intelligent enough to form complex, unique strategies for catching prey depending on their surroundings and the skills of their quarry. Houndour demonstrate some of the most efficient teamwork in the Pokémon world. Around dawn, packs will howl ominously at the moon to indicate to other nearby packs of the boundaries of their territories. Unlike most pack hunters, Houndour packs have no true leaders. Rather, they all are equals and split responsibilities fairly; thus, there is never any infighting for dominance. Houndour are very affectionate towards those they care about; generally, this means other pack members, but for domestic ones this can mean trainers as well.","Houndoom packs are so in sync that members evolve roughly at the same time, within minutes of each other. Unlike Houndour packs, however, Houndoom packs have very clearly defined leaders; individuals whose horns curve back the most take charge. The cries of these Pokémon are described to be eerie and unearthly; in the past, the sound was believed to be the call of the grim reaper. Indeed, the howls of Houndoom are so discomforting that many forest Pokémon will instinctively return to their shelters upon hearing them. Houndoom packs hunt by encircling an area and then setting it ablaze. They then go after prey flushed out of hiding, working together to corner and defeat them. Like Houndour, Houndoom packs share their kills evenly; the leader receives the same portion as the lowliest pack member. The fire that Houndoom breathe, in addition to smelling strongly of sulfur, contains a mix of toxins that cause a searing pain that lasts beyond the burns themselves. The agony is excruciating, and can last indefinitely until treated. Luckily, most Pokémon Centers carry a fast-acting Antidote for it.","Kingdra live near the sea floor away from most other Pokémon, hiding in caves or blending into coral reefs. They spend much of their time resting, and as such do not expend much energy. It is said that when they awaken, they create tornadoes. While this fact is not true, Kingdra have been known to create whirlpools when they “yawn”; by quickly sucking in large amounts of water from beneath the ocean’s surface, they can generate vortexes that pull down food for them to consume. Occasionally, unfortunate ships are also caught in these whirlpools. Kingdra become particularly active during and after storms, awakening in search of prey displaced by rough waters. Kingdra capitalize on these times, as Pokémon frantically swimming in search of shelter are more likely to get caught by their vortexes. After satisfying meals, Kingdra become dormant for up to months at a time; they only need to eat a few times a year, thanks to their rather inactive lifestyles; they sleep the rest of the time (except during mating season, at least).","Phanpy nests, essentially vertical dirt pits with a shallow edge to climb out of, can be found near rivers and waterholes. They will mark surrounding trees with their trunks to signal that these areas have been claimed. In the early morning, Phanpy can be seen showering together in rivers, using their snouts as nozzles. They dry themselves off in the sun over the course of the day. Phanpy are very affectionate and playful Pokémon. Though small, they are strong enough to carry adult humans on their backs. They will often “play” with their trainers by charging into them, but the force of ​their impacts can be enough to send their trainers flying. Alternatively, they will knock things around with their trunk for fun; this pastime generally can be very destructive to the personal belongings of humans. They can easily lift over 150 lbs (68 kg) with their trunks and can also toss objects of similar weights dozens of yards away. Consequently, these affectionate Pokémon can also be very dangerous to be around as well.","Donphan live in herds of roughly a dozen members. The pecking order in a herd is determined by tusk size; the larger the are, the higher their owners are ranked. Donphan primarily travel by tucking themselves into circular, tire-like shapes and rolling down rocky mountain paths and across level plains. While curled up, their hides can withstand most attacks without being scratched. They are strong enough to haul dump trucks and can ram foes with enough force to level buildings and knock down trees. Donphan are often employed by construction companies to flatten swathes of land before building. Disaster relief teams also use them to clear out rocks and mudslides from roads. Once they start rolling, Donphan have great difficulty stopping; they can angle their tusks downwards while spinning to use them as brakes, but this wears down on them greatly. These tusks were once valued by poachers for their use in jewelry, though this practice has largely died out in the modern era.","Porygon2 are improved version of Porygon, with updated software via Up-Grades. Though space travel is still their main mission, they still fall short in this regard; while now capable of functioning in space thanks to newly installed planetary development software, they are unable to fly, and thus cannot move about in a vacuum. Porygon2 are lighter and smaller than their pre-evolutions thanks to optimizations and streamlining. The most enticing feature of their update, though, is their improved artificial intelligence. Porygon2 can learn from experience, modifying their behavior based on information from their surroundings. The software isn’t perfect, however, and may occasionally display a few bugs, manifesting as strange actions not programmed into their original software. Additionally, its deletion algorithm is quite inefficient, causing it to store more data than is necessary over time. The DRM protection on Porygon2 has also been improved, with Silph Co. enhancing security measures to prevent piracy. However, there have been rumors of a hacker group cracking the DRM and selling unauthorized software updates. Silph Co. is currently hard at work tracking these pirates down.","At first glance, Stantler appear to be rather unremarkable Pokémon. However, they hold odd power within their horns. These antlers are shaped like eyes, with the dark orbs inside resembling pupils. Staring at the orbs will cause one to feel inexplicably drawn towards them; onlookers lose control of their bodies and simply collapse to the floor, mesmerized. Their antlers can subtly adjust the flow of light and air to create illusions of distorted reality. Young Stantler will defend themselves by creating the mirage of a stampeding herd charging at attackers. Due to the mystical power of their horns, however, Stantler were often targeted by poachers. In the past, the species was nearly hunted to extinction because of this demand. The spheres in their antlers can be ground into a powerful sleep-inducing agent, and the horns themselves are valued for their beauty. Nowadays, Stantler horns are a seasonal, sustainable commodity, gathered from the ground at the end of winter after Stantler herds naturally shed their antlers."," Smeargle live alone, but do maintain groups of “comrades”; comrade Smeargle will pass through each others’ territories, share details of food source locations with each other, and even paint each others’ bodies for fun. Their tails secrete a colorful, viscous fluid that they uses to paint trees, marking their domains in this manner. Different Smeargle have “paint” of different colors; the hue is determined by a variety of factors, including genetics, diet, and environment. Recent studies have shown that the intensity of their \"paint\" color changes based on their emotions. Smeargle born around the same time in the same area will become comrades with one another. These groups remain close for life, though they will separate and claim their own territories upon reaching adulthood. Before Smeargle leave their groups, their comrades will paint footprint markings on their backs; if they ever meet again, they will be able to distinguish each other by the pattern. Smeargle can paint over 5,000 different kinds of brush strokes with their tails. They are the only Pokémon known to learn the move Sketch. Wild Smeargle paintings are a fairly esoteric market, but enthusiasts will pay quite hefty sums of money for certain symbols and patterns.","Tyrogue are a wandering Pokémon, having no fixed shelter and constantly moving to different locations. They are very determined and energetic, spending the day searching for new foes to spar with. They will attempt to engage in combat with nearly anything that moves, but will not attack unless they believe the opponent has given consent. Tyrogue accept victory humbly, but will sometimes take losses less than graciously. If defeated, they will nurse their wounds until healed, but will then immediately search for the foe that defeated them and attempt to hold a rematch. They will continue to do so until they become strong enough to win. Tyrogue will fight until exhaustion, even when it is clear that they will lose. They take their training very seriously, and will become stressed if they miss even a single day. As a result, trainers with Tyrogue must maintain consistent and varied training regimens to keep their Tyrogue healthy. Despite their size, they are strong fighters; opponents will often be surprised by their skill in combat.","Hitmontop are rather unorthodox fighters, as one may notice from their upside-down orientation in combat. When fighting, they perform enchanting “dances” of sorts before turning on their heads and spinning. Foes that are entranced by their elegant motions are then caught off-guard by their sudden flips, being pummeled by flurry of kicks as Hitmontop use Triple Kick. This spinning motion is both an offensive and defensive tactic; on one hand, their centrifugal force increases the strength of their hits by a factor of 10. On the other, their rapid spinning enables them to deflect many projectiles aimed at them. Hitmontop actually travel faster by spinning than walking. If they spin fast enough, they may even begin to drill holes into the ground. Hitmontop can be found in dojos teaching others the art of balance, which is important in many forms of martial arts. Even when pushed, they can orient themselves so that they tilt back into equilibrium without being acted upon by another external force.","To onlookers, Smoochum would appear to be rather vain Pokémon; they constantly check their reflections in ice or water to see if they have gotten dirty and will spend copious amounts of time cleaning themselves if they have. However, keeping clean is important to Smoochum because their skin is very sensitive; even mild irritants such as stray dirt can cause them to break out in rashes. Their lips are particularly delicate; they use them as their main method of gathering information about their surroundings. When they come across something foreign, their first instinct is to run up to it (though they are rather clumsy and often fall) and kiss it. This is also how it cleans objects prior to touching them, smooching them and then licking the dirt off of its lips. Smoochum can distinguish and remember thousands of different objects based on their textures and taste from their lips alone. They then categorize these things into what they like and dislike. As they walk, they bob their heads back and forth constantly, as if they were about to kiss someone. They dislike heat and will become cranky and irritable when uncomfortably warm. In the wild, Smoochum keep their lips moisturized by applying tree sap.","Elekid love to play outside in thunderstorms. They wind their arms to build up charge; however, because they cannot hold much electricity at once, most of the built up power is dissipated immediately. This is done by the two prongs on their heads. As Elekid spin their arms, the area between their prongs will glow a light neon blue, transferring excess charge to the surrounding air. Elekid also tire easily and will stop to rest between wind-ups. If any part of their bodies touch metal, all of their electricity will discharge, forcing them to wind arms again. Elekid have a weak spot right between their prongs. However, a weak but potentially painful electric current runs between them, deterring attackers from striking this area. Even when resting, this spot remains charged, warding off foes who may otherwise see tired Elekid as easy targets. Elekid can quickly discharge what little electricity they can store in short, concentrated bursts to attack, but must recharge after each release. They compete for electricity in urban areas alongside the likes of Togedemaru and Dedenne. These Pokémon seem to cheer up when they hear the sound of a crack of thunder; this even applies when the sound is merely a recording rather than the real thing.","Magby have internal body temperatures of over 1100°F (600°C) and can spit flames with similar heat. They can evaporate small puddles merely by standing near them. Their blood is magma-like; as they breathe, they let out tiny embers from their mouths and nostrils. Their health can be gauged from the color of their flames. Magby that spit out yellow or orange fire are healthy and in good shape. Those that exhale flames that are dull or are mixed with black smoke, however, are likely fatigued or ill. Magby that can only spew out smoke are critically hurt and should be taken to Pokémon Centers immediately. They make their homes directly in the craters of active volcanoes, right at the edges of lava pools. It is widely believed that if many Magby begin to cluster in the same crater within a short period of time, then the volcano in question will erupt very soon. While this has not yet been proven, scientists are currently looking into this phenomenon as a possible way to predict eruptions in densely-populated areas before they occur. Magby are also known for their use in ceramics; a famous Johto potter uses a Magby to fire his kiln.","Miltank are common on farms and ranches, where they are raised for their highly nutritious milk. Because Miltank milk contains so many vitamins, nutrients, and minerals (and calories), it is often touted as a “cure-all” drink for the sick. Children are also encouraged to drink Miltank milk with the promise of growing up strong and healthy. Miltank can produce over 5 gallons of milk a day. Their milk has a naturally rich and sweet taste, richer and sweeter when sourced from Miltank raised in rich pastures, and is often made into yogurt for those who cannot consume it naturally. It should be noted that consuming too much Miltank milk in a short period of time can result in an upset stomach. Curiously, when around young kids or Pokémon, Miltank will produce more milk than usual. Farmers use this to their advantage, opening up their farms as petting zoos and encouraging parents to take their kids to visit. Their sturdy bodies make them well-suited for children. Milking a Miltank oddly benefits from a musical background; one must pull on its udders rhythmically to extract milk efficiently. The most common brand of commercial milk is Moomoo Milk, made from the Miltank of MooMoo Farms on Johto Route 39.","Blissey are some of the most compassionate Pokémon in the world. Their fur twitches when they sense beings that are sad or ill, and they immediately try to make them feel better. They can sense unhappiness from over a mile away. Blissey will often share their eggs with complete strangers who happen to be down on their luck. A single bite of their eggs, which have enough vitamins and minerals to feed a person for a whole day, can immediately lift spirits and ease illnesses. Consuming whole eggs will compel people or Pokémon to act just as kindly as Blissey to others until the nutrients from the eggs pass through their systems. Unsurprisingly, ethically-sourced eggs are a huge delicacy due to their rarity and are exorbitantly expensive. Because of their compassionate natures, Blissey are often found working in Pokémon Centers alongside their pre-evolutions Chansey; in fact, they are more commonly found in Centers than in the wild, where they are exceedingly rare (even more so than the already-elusive Chansey). Blissey will work tirelessly to heal the sick and weary, not being able to rest until their patients are at the very least in stable conditions.","Raikou is said to be found running across fields and plains, sprinting faster than lightning. Its bark can echo for miles into the distance, creating a shock wave akin to the sound of thunder. The rain cloud-like fur on its back stores electrical energy; it can shoot lightning and create storms with this fur. As it runs, it also charges this cloud with electricity from the surrounding air. Raikou is one of the three legendary beasts mentioned in the legend of the Brass Tower. In the tale, three Pokemon were trapped inside the tower in Johto when it was struck by lightning; the building burned down and killed all three Pokemon before being put out by a fortuitous rain. A mysterious bird Pokemon flew over the tower, reviving the three deceased as the legendary beasts. Raikou is said to represent the lightning that set the tower ablaze, given electrical powers from the bolt that struck the building. Some believe that the Pokemon that became Raikou in the myth was originally a Jolteon, given their similar electrical affinities.","It is said that Entei appears with the eruption of a new volcano. It races across the land to relieve itself of excess heat, and is able to incinerate foes who stand in its way with columns of fire that are hotter than magma. As it runs, the billowing smoke-like fur on its back dissipates its energy, heating up the land around it. Entei is said to have the passion and power of an active volcano. Some say that every time it roars, a volcano erupts somewhere around the globe. Like its brethren Raikou and Suicune, Entei constantly roams about. It rarely stops for even a moment to rest, let alone settle in a single location for an extended period of time. In the Brass Tower myth of the three legendary beasts, Entei represents the fire that burned down the building and killed the three Pokémon trapped inside. Some contend that before being resurrected by the mysterious bird Pokémon, Entei was in fact originally a Flareon; this idea is based on the fact that both Entei and Flareon are closely affiliated with fire.","Suicune is said to be the physical manifestation of the north wind and the embodiment of the tranquility of clean spring waters. It can purify dirty water simply by touching it with a single paw. Suicune runs across plains in tandem with the north wind, searching for polluted lakes to purify. It is said if one suddenly feels the northern wind blowing out of nowhere, it is a sign that Suicune will soon appear. Suicune can run across water; any lake or river that it touches immediately becomes clean and potable, no matter how murky it was originally. The ribbons on its body ripple in the direction of the north wind, indicating where it will be headed next. In the Brass Tower myth of the three legendary beasts, Suicune represents the rain that eventually quenched the burning building after it had trapped and killed three Pokémon inside of it. Some people say that Suicune was resurrected from a deceased Vaporeon, because both Suicune and Vaporeon have innate water-related powers.","Mother Tyranitar will lay their eggs individually underground, covering each with large, mountainous piles of dirt. Upon hatching, infant Larvitar instinctively begin eating the soil around them, constantly consuming dirt without rest. They will eventually manage to burrow their way through the entire mountain, a process that can take anywhere from weeks to months depending on how much dirt they were buried under. It is only upon finishing their meals that they see their mothers’ faces--as well as sunlight for the first time, which they often find blinding). Once Larvitar reach the surface, however, they almost immediately begin preparing for evolution. Using the large storages of energy gained from their giant meals, Larvitar will find crevices in mountainsides to hide. There, they will pupate as they evolve into Pupitar. Trained Larvitar must be fed constantly with dirt in order to remain healthy; in the wild, they will do almost nothing other than eat before evolution, and trained ones will behave no differently. Consequently, raising Larvitar often becomes a very time-consuming--and pricey--affair.","Pupitar are limbless (discounting the growing arms and legs within their shells), but they are not immobile. When threatened, they will thrash about violently in hopes of bludgeoning or piercing foes with various parts of their bodies. Even if they fail to make contact, their sudden movements often topple unstable portions of their mountainous homes, trapping foes in rockslides. Such occurrences don’t harm Pupitar; their shells are as hard as sheet rock. Additionally, the carapces of these Pokémon contain highly pressurized gas. By venting this gas out of their shells in a controlled manner, they can propel themselves at high speeds towards attackers. The force of these launches can dent solid steel without even scratching their shells. They can also use this gas to find new places to hide. However, Pupitar cannot replenish this gas once released, so they do not practice this method of defense and locomotion often. Inside their shells, new arms and legs are beginning to develop as these Pokémon prepare for evolution. Pupitar do not eat, relying on the energy they had stored as Larvitar for survival. Even when not in danger, these Pokémon will thrash about in order to relieve themselves of stored gases, leading to the common belief that they are temperamental and impatient for evolution.","Tyranitar can be very devastating, as they are aggressive and care little for other life around them. Their armor is nearly impenetrable, making it difficult to stop these Pokemon when they are enraged; this makes Tyranitar eager to fight others, as they are unlikely to get hurt. They can level entire landscapes, forcing cartographers to redraw maps after their rampages. Even when not angered, Tyranitar can still be destructive; they are known to cause earthquakes as they topple mountains while searching for nest-building locations. Though powerful, wild Tyranitar are also rare. Furthermore, they general live in remote areas away from most people, and do not intentionally approach foes that they do not see as comparable competitors. However, there has been one notable incident of a Tyranitar wreaking havoc on a large urban city. The cost of damage was in the billions, and it took days for the Pokémon to be stopped. Since then, most cities located near Tyranitar territory have developed defense systems against them. Water is one of the few reliable deterrents against Tyranitar, so moats are a common choice for these cities.","Lugia is said to rest at the bottom of the ocean because of its sheer power; a light flapping of its wings can blow apart houses and tear down cliffs. Over water, it is believed to be able to stir up 40-day storms as it flies. It is known as the “guardian of the ocean,” defending the sea from anything seeking to harm marine life or sully pristine waters. However, it is also believed to be a benevolent Pokémon, calming rough storms to allow the passage of benign boats and ships. Lugia is said to control the three legendary birds: Articuno, Zapdos, and Moltres. In the Silver Wing myth, Lugia is thought to have shed a single feather on each of three mysterious eggs. One landed on a frozen egg on a frigid northern ice cap--Articuno. Another fell onto a desolate island during a storm, landing on an egg just as it was struck by lightning--Zapdos. The last descended into an island volcano on an egg submerged in magma--Moltres. Upon completing its flight, Lugia then returned to is native waters in the vicinity of the Whirl Islands in Johto, where it is thought to reside to this day.","Ho-oh is said to fly continuously around the world, leaving rainbows in its wake. Its feathers sparkle in seven colors by refracting sunlight. It is believed that anyone lucky enough to see this Pokémon will be blessed with eternal happiness. Some believe that Ho-oh will stop to rest at the feet of rainbows, but will only appear to those who have pure hearts. The Brass Tower legend revolves largely around Ho-oh. In the story, Ho-oh used to perch regularly on the Bell Tower (also known as the Tin Tower) in Ecruteak City, Johto. During a storm, however, lightning struck the Bell Tower’s sister building, the Brass Tower. The structure burned down, killing three Pokémon trapped inside. Ho-oh was deeply saddened by the horrible tragedy, and, seeking to undo the damage, resurrected the three deceased Pokémon as the legendary beasts: Raikou, Entei, and Suicune. Upon doing so, it flew away from the Bell Tower to begin an endless journey around the world, seeking to bring joy and happiness to those in need; this earned it the nickname “the guardian of the skies.”","Celebi is known as the “Voice of the Forest.” It is exceedingly elusive, as it not only is able to travel across land, but across time as well. It may appear in and out of temporal portals almost instantaneously, leaving no trace of its presence other than blooming flora in areas where it has appeared. It can even revive dead plant life simply through its mere presence. Though Celebi is believed to be able to visit any place and time in history, it only appears deep in forests, and even then only during peaceful times. Years can go by without a single sighting reported because of this. Some believe that sighting Celebi is an indication of a bright future ahead for the whole world. As it travels across time, it is fabled to leave behind mysterious eggs brought back from the future in its wake. Celebi is said to use its powers to protect the forests in which it dwells. It will influence events in the past to stop harmful ones from occurring in the future. Celebi is believed by some scientists to be able to exist in multiple time periods at the same time, though this claim is obviously rather difficult to prove.","Many young trainers will start off their journeys in the Hoenn region with Treecko as their first Pokémon. They require the least caution or experience out of the three Hoenn starters, given their cool and collected demeanors. Treecko never panic, even when faced with stronger foes, and will stand their ground no matter what. Though rare in the wild, they can be occasionally found high up in the branches of tall trees. They make their nests there to stay away from most predators. When their trees are threatened, Treecko will leap down and ferociously defend their homes. They are adept climbers, equipped with microscopic hooks on the bottom of their feet that enable them to hold onto slick surfaces. Treecko slam foes with their tails to attack. They also use them to measure humidity and predict the next day’s weather. Treecko are known to stare down foes much larger themselves and provoke them into combat; however, they will never back down from a fight. Their unwavering collectedness and tenacity make them popular choices for starter Pokémon.","Like Treecko, Grovyle are masters of climbing. Upon evolution, however, they also gain the skills of jumping and leaping as well. In the dense forests in which they reside, Grovyle can leap from tree branch to tree branch with ease, gliding between them using the leaves on their arms for aid. This ability enables them to both escape from predators and sneak up on prey. Grovyle have extremely powerful thigh muscles that allow them to perform such jumping feats. In addition to helping them in the air, their foliage also helps them camouflage in the trees. The long leaves on their heads are also sensitive to flowing air currents, allowing them to adjust their trajectories in the air to land exactly where they want to. They are so skilled at jumping, in fact, that some say nothing can catch a fleeing Grovyle in its natural forest habitat. When threatened, Grovyle first confound their foes by swiftly leaping from tree to tree, obscuring their true locations. Then, they suddenly pounce at their opponents, slashing at them with the quick, but strong Leaf Blade.","Sceptile are known to be some of the strongest fighters in the Hoenn forests they call home. The leaves on their wrists are as sharp as swords and can cut through stone (though they are more commonly used to slice down tree trunks). They retain both the climbing and leaping abilities of their pre-evolutions, attacking foes from above with swift slashes from their leaves. Sceptile are extremely protective of their territories; they keep close watches on intruders and will not hesitate to strike should they feel their homes are threatened. They also take extraordinary care of the trees within their territories as well, making sure that each gets enough water and sunlight. The seeds on their backs are filled with nutrients and minerals that they use to help struggling saplings in their forests. Sceptile regulate their body temperature by basking in sunlight, as they are ectotherms. They store light energy in their seeds. Not only are Sceptile protective and nurturing Pokémon, but also fierce and strong ones as well, making them popular starters for trainers in the Hoenn region.","Trainers who pick Torchic at the beginning of their journeys will quickly learn that, while endearing, their quirkiness can also be a source of worry. Torchic have some trouble walking and will always be a few steps behind their trainers, wobbling around with unsteady steps. They are also afraid of the dark, and will begin crying if left alone at night. Many trainers find their behavior cute, however, and thus choose Torchic as their starter Pokémon in Hoenn. Their internal flame sacs can heat up to temperatures of 1,800°F (1,000°C), hot enough to scorch foes black when they attack.Their feathers are soft and downy, almost like stuffed dolls. Trainers who have raised Torchic describe embracing them as “like hugging fluffy bottles of hot water;” luckily for Torchic, who are often afraid of sleeping alone, their likeness to warm stuffed plushes also means that most trainers have little problem sleeping alongside them. Their cuteness and quirkiness make them consistently popular choices as starter Pokémon in Hoenn.","Combusken have very distinctive, harsh cries that are well-known to many rural inhabitants. This is due to their training habits; early in the morning, Combusken will go running through plains and mountains to strengthen their legs and thighs. Then, they prepare for kicking practice by letting out loud yells to gain focus. These cries often wake people and Pokémon in the early hours in the morning, much to their dismay. However, their dedication and practice pays off; thanks to their training, they can dole out up to 10 kicks a second. In combat, they will not relent until their foes have surrendered. Combusken also spew flames from their mouths in battle. When fighting, their bodies heat up; they release this excess heat in the form of flames. Combusken are also known to use their distinctive cries to intimidate and bewilder foes. Watching two trained Combusken fight was a popular pastime among trainers in older times. They can combine their kicking prowess and fire powers in one by using Blaze Kick in battle.","Trainers who have managed to raise clumsy Torchic to maturity are rewarded with powerful Blaziken, who are masters of the martial arts. Their legs are sturdy enough to leap over 30-story buildings, and their arms have become much stronger as well. In battle, flames erupt from their wrists and envelop their knuckles, allowing them to pummel foes with fiery punches that can scorch and burn. The stronger their foes are, the stronger these flames burn, and the more determined Blaziken are to defeat them. Their ankles can also similarly ignite, enabling them to land fiery kicks as well as punches if necessary. Every few years, their feathers burn off from repeated exposure to fire. However, newer, softer ones regrow in their place. These feathers are important because they help Blaziken regulate their body temperatures; when they burn up, they must rest and refrain from using their fire powers until they regrow. Their awesome power and speed make Blaziken strong choices for starter Pokémon in Hoenn.","Trainers in Hoenn who want playful, outgoing starters may consider Mudkip as their choices. Mudkip are deceptively strong for their size, able to lift large boulders out of the water and crush them by planting themselves into the ground and heaving. The orange growths on the sides of their heads are actually gills, allowing Mudkip to breathe underwater; on land, they breathe using their mouths. They use their tail fins to accelerate themselves through the water. Their head fins, on the other hand, are primarily tasked with observation. These fins can sense both air and water currents, letting Mudkip navigate the murky waters they call home without actually being able to see their surroundings. Mudkip sleep by burying themselves in the mud. They spend roughly equal time on land and in the water, but must keep their skin moist so they don’t dry out and become lethargic. They love to play around; many trainers in Hoenn choose Mudkip as their starters because of their uncanny ability to earn the affection of those around them.","Marshtomp can often be found in muddy estuaries, both near the sea as well as inland. They spend much of their time out of the water; a sticky, mucus-like film coating their skin keeps them moist and prevents air from drying them out. To rehydrate, Marshtomp will play in the mud. Curiously enough, they can actually use their powerful hind legs to travel faster through mud than through clean water. These strengthened hind legs also enable them to walk bipedally, unlike Mudkip. In battle, Marshtomp attempt to lure foes into the mire rather than step out of it themselves, as they can easily overpower most foes on their home turfs with the move Muddy Water. Marshtomp burrow in the mud to sleep. Individuals who live near the ocean sometimes emerge at low tide to play on the beach, while those inland may splash around at the water’s edge. Scientists believe that living in soft mud with poor footing is what pressured them to develop such strong hind legs, enabling them to stand firm even in the muck.","Swampert are popular Hoenn starters for their brute strength and aquatic skills. They make nests out of boulders on pristine beaches and on the edge of murky swamplands, hauling rocks weighing over a ton with ease both on land and in the water. They can use their sturdy, rock-hard arms to shatter rocks as they creates nests, and can hammer foes with similar swings of their arms as well. Swampert can singlehandedly tow boats stranded at sea, and are indeed often employed to rescue endangered ships. Using their powerful arms, Swampert can swim as fast as jet skis. They can use their fins to predict incoming storms by noticing changes in wave and wind patterns, piling boulders around their nests to protect their loved ones when they sense one nearing. Their powerful vision allows them to see clearly even in murky waters. Though strong and aggressive at times, Swampert can still be just as playful as their pre-evolutions; indeed, it is this combination of traits that makes them such popular starter Pokémon.","Poochyena are known to be persistent, yet cowardly fighters. They have acute senses of smell that allow them to track foes down without fail, and will tenaciously chase down their prey until they catch them. Oftentimes, they will pursue foes until they tire out and can no longer flee. As omnivores, Poochyena can eat nearly anything; in fact, they often will try to bite anything that moves, including inorganic objects like cars and bicycles. Running from aggressive Poochyena will only encourage them to begin chasing. Instead, attempting to intimidate them by staring them down and feigning lunges is a far more effective tactic. As the saying goes, they are “all bark and no bite.” They will cower and flee when confronted, even when against smaller or weaker foes. Though Poochyena bare their large fangs against all attackers, they will only pursue things that they believe they have scared. They will become submissive towards those who appear unfazed by their displays, often running away with their tail between their legs.","Mightyena hunt in packs of roughly 10 individuals, prowling around grasslands and forests. These packs are highly coordinated, able to execute complex strategies in order to take down foes much larger than themselves. Before attacking, Mightyena will flatten their bodies and emit low, guttural growls. These sounds will alert nearby pack members of disturbances, signaling for them to prepare for attack as well. Mightyena packs have very well-defined pecking orders; alpha Mightyena lead their packs and eat first after taking down prey, while the omegas always trail at the end and eat whatever is left over after all the others have finished eating. This mentality carries on to even trained Mightyena, who will only obey directions from skilled trainers who have demonstrated leadership and dominance. They show submissiveness by licking their trainers’ faces and rolling onto their backs when asked. On the other hand, Mightyena will outright ignore trainers that they believe to be “under” them hierarchically.","Zigzagoon, as their names suggest, tend to travel in zigzag fashions, wandering left and right as they explore their surroundings. This is largely due to their extremely curious natures; Zigzagoon have the urge to examine almost everything around them, walking back and forth as they attempt to catch glimpses of all of their surroundings. Oftentimes, they will use their keen senses of smell to locate items hidden in the grass, holding their noses to the ground and sniffing as they zigzag towards concealed objects. Because of this, Zigzagoon trails and footprints are very easy to identify. Their hairs are very bristly; they will rub their backs against the bark of trees to mark their territories. As omnivores, Zigzagoon will gladly consume most food that they come across. However, they seem to have a particular affinity for Oran Berries, and will hoard them impulsively. Zigzagoon dislike fighting and will flee when intimidated to avoid conflict. When cornered, they will play dead in hopes of being left alone by their attackers.","Similar to how Zigzagoon travel in zigzags, Linoone dash in straight lines. They always run at full speed--60 mph (100 km/h)--and can only turn at 90° angles; Additionally, they must come to full stops before turning. Consequently, roads with gentle curves are rather challenging for these Pokémon. Like Zigzagoon, Linoone are omnivores. They rely primarily on surprise to capture prey, however; though they are indeed fast, their inability to turn makes it easy for targets to escape should they notice Linoone before being attacked. Linoone are also surprisingly adept swimmers, capable of leaping into the water mid-charge to capture aquatic prey. They have an affinity for round objects, which they will store in their expandable cheek pouches to take back to their nests. They hoard these objects in secret stashes. Consequently, Linoone will often be found holding globular Oran Berries (like their pre-evolutions) or occasionally more misshapen, but still recognizably round, Sitrus Berries in their cheeks. Linoone fur is prized for its strength and flexibility, commonly finding use in shaving brushes.","Wurmple primarily defend themselves using the two spikes on their rears. When in trouble, they can secrete poison out of these barbs and raise their hindquarters up to deter potential predators--specifically the Swellow and Starly who consider Wurmple their preferred prey. Alternatively, they can shoot a white fluid out of their mouths that turns sticky in contact with air--silk. The substance entangles and inhibits predators, giving Wurmple time to flee. Wurmple feed on tree sap; they use their spikes to peel back bark and feed on the exposed resin that oozes out. They spend most of their time on trees. The bottoms of their feet have tiny suction cups strong enough to allow them to inch upside-down even on glass surfaces. Wurmple are voracious eaters, as they need to store a good deal of energy for evolution. It is believed that a Wurmple’s personality is the primary determining factor in its evolutionary path. Outgoing, cheerful Wurmple tend to evolve into Silcoon, while introverted, downcast ones seem to evolve into Cascoon.","When evolution approaches, Wurmple will either nestle themselves in the crooks of tree branches or on top of piles of large leaves. Should they evolve into Silcoon, they will choose spots that receive lots of sunlight. Silcoon attach themselves to nearby branches or leaves with copious amounts of silk to prevent themselves from accidentally being dislodged from their shelters. Silcoon do not move often, but luckily for them, they do not need to eat; they store all the energy they need to survive as Wurmple. They have been known, however, to spin silk in such a manner that morning dew or rain water will flow down to them and help slake their thirst. When in danger, Silcoon rely on their tough casings to protect themselves. Though capable of movement (albeit slowly), they rarely actually do so, as they need to save as much energy as they can for evolution. Their activity tends to be limited to concealing themselves with leaves to hide from predators. Despite their immobility, however, studies show that Silcoon are keenly aware of their surroundings.","Beautifly can be seen flitting from flower to flower, consuming pollen--their favorite food. People often leave out potted plants with hopes of catching sight of visiting Beautifly. Despite their appearance, however, Beautifly can in fact be very aggressive. Disturbing feeding Beautifly will anger them and cause them to chase offenders while jabbing them sharply with their needle-like proboscises. Though they prefer pollen, they are also content with stabbing and draining the body fluids of other prey if food is scarce. During mating season, Beautifly of both genders will attack members of the same sex ruthlessly in competition for mates. Their viciousness, however, is largely unknown to the public, who often see them as symbols of love, beauty, and innocence. They are solitary and territorial Pokémon, only coming together during the spring mating season. During this time, Beautifly attacks also become more common, as the Pokémon both become more aggressive and numerous when mating, riding the spring winds into densely-populated areas.","Cascoon are found in the nooks of branches and in piles of dead leaves, using silk to attach foliage to themselves as camouflage. They prefer to dwell in dark areas away from sunlight. When their cocoons first form, they are soft and pliable. However, they harden over time; when they begin to crack, their owners are close to evolution. The insides of their cocoons are very hot, as their cells are creating and storing energy to evolve. Cascoon are largely immobile, conserving as much energy as they can. Even when attacked, they remains motionless; however, they are still entirely conscious. In fact, studies show that Cascoon can remember the pain they endured and the faces of every one of their attackers. It is said that upon evolution into Dustox, they will seek revenge on all of those that had harmed them. The “spikes” on their cocoons are actually remnants of the silk they used to attach themselves to leaves and branches. Trained Cascoon (and Silcoon, for that matter) often lack these protrusions, as they likely did not hide in trees like their wild brethren.","Dustox are nocturnal Pokémon, feeding on the leaves of trees after the sun sets. They use their antennae like radars to navigate without light, though their eyes are in fact quite adept at seeing in the dark. When Dustox flap their wings, they let loose clouds of fine, toxic powder strong enough to make pro wrestlers sick. They uses this in their defense, flapping and letting loose the dust to deter enemies. Dustox are attracted to bright lights, a problem for many urban areas; they will often congregate along boulevards and avenues, attracted there by street lamps and large trees. In their wake, Dustox swarms leave behind lines of barren branches and large clouds of toxic powder. Though they will consume nearly any variety of leaves (even some toxic ones, which may have to do with their Poison-typings), Dustox have shown a particular affinity for the leaves of Persim trees, even sometimes feeding on the Berries themselves. This makes them a huge problem for Persim Berry farmers, who consider Dustox the primary pests of the business.","Lotad are amphibious Pokémon, but they spend virtually all of their time in the water. They primarily photosynthesize for energy, though they also feed on aquatic weeds from time to time as well. Because of their reliance on photosynthesis, studies have shown that the leaves on their heads have been growing steadily larger in surface area with every passing generation; many hypothesize that the reason why Lotad rarely exercise their terrestrial abilities is because these leaves have become too heavy for efficient land travel. Despite this, Lotad will occasionally leave the water to search for new ponds if their original ones become polluted; they must drink clean water routinely to prevent their pads from wilting. Lotad camouflage themselves underwater, leaving only their leaves exposed to blend in with lily pads. These leaves are buoyant enough to suspend them perfectly in this fashion. Lotad are docile and easygoing Pokémon. They are known to carry smaller Pokémon that can’t swim over bodies of water, ferrying them over on their broad pads.","Lombre are nocturnal Pokémon, becoming active late in the evening. Their favorite pastime is playing tricks on unwary fishermen. Lombre will sometimes pop out of the water suddenly to startle nearby people and Pokémon, or may tug on submerged fishing lines to confuse anglers. On occasion, they may even pose as human children, confusing tired travelers with their similar silhouettes in the moonlight. Their skin is coated with a slippery, slimy mucus to keep them moist outside of the water. Touching their skin causes what is described as a “horribly unpleasant” sensation. Lombre spend most of the day near the water’s edge, sleeping on beds of reeds. They feed on aquatic moss growing on underwater rocks and also catch and eat fish. It is widely known that Lombre have a very strong liking of Spelon Berries; in fact, many fishermen will carry some of the Berries when fishing in Lombre territory to pacify these Pokémon and keep them from playing tricks on them. Lombre will accept these Berries as “peace offerings” of sorts from people.","Ludicolo are very carefree, jolly Pokémon. Upon hearing a festive melody, they will begin to dance rhythmically, not stopping until the music ceases. Watching them do this uplifts the spirits of all who see them and encourage them to dance as well. When Ludicolo dance, their cells work much harder than they normally do, producing more energy and making them stronger. When there isn’t music, Ludicolo will seek to create their own rhythms, employing a variety of materials found in their habitats. Tools ranging from stone “drums” to reed pipes have been found near ponds where Ludicolo dwell. In battle, they will play these instruments and dance to the melodies produced in order to power up their attacks. Oftentimes, the sight of dancing Ludicolo is enough to placate aggressors, who may even begin dancing as well. They tend to congregate near sources of joyful music; young children hiking near pounds sometimes attract groups of Ludicolo when singing songs. The dancing attracts more Ludicolo until all individuals in the general vicinity are present.","Seedot attach themselves to tree branches using the tops of their heads like suction cups. These protrusions also double as siphons, allowing Seedot to drain moisture from the trees they are attached to. As they fill themselves with water and nutrients, their bodies become glossier. Full Seedot are heavy enough to fall from their trees and land on the ground. There, they can blend in with fallen acorns until they are ready for evolution. Curiously, Seedot enjoy scaring other Pokémon. Wild Pidgey and Tailow often mistake them for real acorns, and Seedot delight in startling them by suddenly jumping up at the last second. They may also drop prematurely from their branches to scare unsuspecting people and Pokémon below. Strong winds can also dislodge Seedot before they are ready. They are able feed from tree trunks and roots instead of branches though, if necessary. Once a day, Seedot will polish themselves using fallen leaves. They pass the time waiting for evolution by using the glare from their shiny bodies to disorient passing travelers.","Nuzleaf dwell deep in thick forests, hiding within the hollows of trees. They enjoy disturbing lost travelers, venturing out from their concealed shelters to scare them. Using the leaves on their heads as flutes, they can play deeply unsettling melodies that fill the hearts of listeners with dread. Alternatively, they may play melodies to put unwary travelers to sleep and then pull off all sorts of tricks on them, such as stealing their supplies. They can also emit disturbing cackling sounds that seem to echo throughout the forest. Nuzleaf are adept climbers, swiftly leaping between trees to unsettle travelers with the sound of rustling leaves around them. In battle, this uncanny ability to cause dread manifests in the form of the attack Extrasensory. Nuzleaf have a weak point in the form of their long noses; if they are pinched, Nuzleaf inexplicably become unable to attack. Trainers can also stave them off with open flames. Popular folklore tells the tale of a Nuzleaf who became human, but was cursed with a nose that become longer each time it told a lie.","Shiftry are rare in the wild, found deep in forests in the branches of old trees; some say they will only inhabit trees over 1,000 years old. Believed to be guardians of forests, Shiftry can create gusts of wind reaching 70 mph (110 km/h) using the leaf fans on their hands to blow away intruders. They can predict the actions of opponents and take preemptive measures; some believe that Shiftry can read minds, while others contend that they are highly sensitive to air currents and body language interpretation. Regardless of how they predict actions, Shiftry can uncannily prepare themselves from most attacks. Popular folklore says that the only way to defeat them is to do so unwittingly; for example, trying to attack a Shiftry but missing and striking a tree instead, hitting it on the nose--its weak point--with the dislodged shrapnel. In this manner, the Shiftry would be unable to predict the hit because there was no intent in the action. Shiftry is said to ride cold, winter winds through forests, leaving behind feelings of deep unease in travelers.","Taillow are famous for their gutsy spirits, never backing down no matter what the situation. This is true even from birth. Young Taillow leave their nests as soon as possible; the minute they can reach the closest branch from their nests, they fumble over to them and never return. They has been known to confront Pokémon as fearsome as Skarmory without flinching; even when they lose, they refuse to admit that their foes are stronger. Only a few things can break their spirits. Homesickness is one of them; because Taillow leave their nests at such a young age, they may be seen crying alone late at night, longing for their homes. The other is hunger--hungry Taillow will wail incessantly until they find food. Although Taillow feed primarily on Wurmple, they may also feed on Berries and other crops. This makes migrating Taillow flocks a large nuisance for many farmers. Taillow prefer warm temperatures, migrating as far as 180 miles (300 kilometers) a day in search of suitable climates to escape colder seasons.","Swellow are graceful flier, often seen gliding in long, elegant arcs on warm spring winds. They circle grasslands and meadows in search of food. Using their keen eyesight, they can spot the rustling of fish and insects below, steeply and swiftly diving to catch prey in their sharp talons. Swellow are very nimble; when they dive, they never miss their targets. They takes great care of their glossy feathers, preening them before each flight. By keeping them clean, they can prevent dirt and other detritus from slowing them down while hunting. In flocks, Swellow will clean each other’s feathers, particularly in areas that would be difficult for individuals to reach on their own. Swellow will dive briefly into water to clean themselves, and will skim the surface of lakes with their beaks open to drink; rarely will they land anywhere outside of their nests. In courtship, the Swellow with the longest “streamers” (the two long feathers on their rears) are viewed as the most attractive, and thus are the most active during the mating season.","Wingull build nests on sheer oceanside cliffs. They fly by catching marine updrafts and gliding on them with their long wings; they have hollow bones to facilitate this. These updrafts can take Wingull fairly high in the sky. They are clumsy when it comes to flapping, so they usually glide instead. Their beaks are adept at catching fish near the water’s surface, though they can also dive if necessary. Wingull have a habit of bringing back food and objects they find and hiding them near their nests. This behavior increases as winter approaches, when they begin storing more food than they eat. Scientists are not sure why Wingull do this, as they do not migrate or hibernate and continue searching for food during the winter despite already having hoards. Some have hypothesized that the storages are intended to attract mates, who use the stashes to gauge how well their creators can catch food. When Wingull rest, they fold their wings inwards, forming “M” shapes. When Wingull flock in the sky, fishermen know many fish lurk below.","Pelipper are most notable for their enormous beaks, which are large enough to hold a child. They use these beaks to skim the sea’s surface, swallowing the contents in single gulps; they can swallow as many as 30 Wishiwashi in one go. The beaks are also slightly buoyant; when Pelipper are tired, they rest by landing on the water and bobbing with the waves. Like Wingull, Pelipper build nests on steep seaside cliffs. In addition to catching food, their beaks also serve a myriad of other uses. Most notably, Pelipper can carry objects across large swathes of sea. In the past, people used Pelipper to send messages overseas; sailors still utilize them today to relay information, especially in areas where other forms of communication aren’t available (in this case, the middle of the ocean). Pelipper will carry small Pokémon and items across the sea in exchange for food. They are easygoing, if a bit absentminded, creatures that will gladly help lost people and Pokémon find their way back to shore, even transporting smaller ones free of charge. Pelipper live in large colonies; young males gather food for the flock.","Ralts live in urban areas around humans. The horns on their heads allow them to sense the emotions of those around them. They are extremely timid, rarely appearing to people and spending most of their time in hiding. Ralts emulate the emotions they sense around them; if they feel happiness, they also become happy. If they feel anger or fear, they begin feeling similarly as well, and will flee to prevent such negative emotions from overpowering them. As such, Ralts will only appear in front of cheerful people and Pokémon. Should they sense hostility arising, they will use Teleport to escape. Their body temperatures also slightly correlate with the feelings around them, warming up when around joy but cooling down around anger. When Ralts experience strong emotions, they may begin to visibly shiver. The horns on their heads may also glow slightly. These are signs that the Ralts is overexerting itself with too much emotion, and its trainer should try to calm it down before it hurts itself.","Kirlia draw their power from positive emotions. Because of this, only cheerful, optimistic trainers can raise strong Kirlia. It is said that they become more graceful and powerful the more often they are exposed to positive feelings. When happy, they will dance and twirl to amuse those around them. This in turn makes onlookers happier, giving Kirlia more energy to dance, and so on. In particular, they enjoy dancing on sunny mornings, where the general level of optimism around them is at its peak. Kirlia are highly intelligent, with well-developed brains capable of harnessing respectable psychokinetic powers from the emotions around them. The horns on their heads concentrate their powers, allowing them to distort the space around them and create visual mirages. When around particularly happy individuals, Kirlia can even rip small holes in time itself and discern brief glimpses of the future; such a task, however, requires great skill and very passionate emotions, making it difficult for them to pull it off repeatedly.","Trainers who have the companionship of Gardevoir have demonstrated optimism and purity of heart, as it takes a great amount of positive emotion for Kirlia to evolve. Gardevoir are oddly not affected by gravity, using their psychic powers to counteract it; though they have legs, they float rather than walk. They are enormously loyal to their trainers and will do everything in their power to protect them. They are able to see into the future, but will only reveal what they know to their trainers. In grave danger, Gardevoir will put their trainers’ lives before their own; by using up all of their energy, they can summon small black holes to eliminate threats while teleporting their trainers to safety. Using this ability costs their lives, however. Their attacks strengthen with the need they feel to protect their trainers; thus, their strongest techniques can only be used in dire situations. Gardevoir are very wary of trusting strangers, but will develop the same loyalty they show to their trainers to those who show similar compassion and optimism.","Surskit skate on the surface of weedy freshwater ponds and lakes. The tips of their feet secrete an oil that allows them to stay on the water’s surface. Sometimes, after heavy falls of rain, Surskit may congregate on large puddles of water on the ground. They attract prey by using Sweet Scent and emitting an alluring smell from the glands on their heads. Then, they quickly dart to catch prey using their two front legs. They feed on small fish and microscopic aquatic organisms, competing against Dewpider. When in danger, Surskit will secrete a thick, sweet, honey-like substance from their head glands. Many large Pokémon enjoy the taste of this fluid, attracted to the area by its smell. In some regions, it is also harvested like honey and spread on toast for a sweet treat. By drawing large predators near, Surskit attempt to scare off their attackers by attracting Pokémon that may see their foes as prey. When the weather turns cold, Surskit will hibernate under the cover of dead leaves or fallen logs, emerging once it warms up again. They may climb onto land if their aquatic homes begin to freeze around them. Surskit frequently compete with Dewpider for territory, as both occupy similar niches in their habitats.","The two growths on either side of the heads of Masquerain are not wings, but in fact antennae. Their true wings are the four diamond-shaped appendages on their bodies, which allow them to fly forwards, backwards, sideways, and even hover. They also are coated in an oil that lets Masquerain perch on water. They use the eye patterns on their antennae to intimidate foes and predators, making them appear larger than they really are. When their antennae begin drooping and appearing “sad,” it is a sign that rain is coming. They must take shelter under trees when it rains; their large antennae are surprisingly absorbent and can become waterlogged when wet, preventing them from flying properly. Masquerain feed exclusively on the nectar and leaves of aquatic plants. They also lay their eggs near these plants. Masquerain can use Sweet Scent by emitting an odor from the tips of their heads like Surskit; however, rather than attracting prey, the scent they release instead placates those around them. This allows them to fly away without confrontation.","Shroomish dislike harsh light; they stay in the shade of large leaves and trees during the day, only venturing out after the sun sets. They feed primarily on rotting plant matter and particularly prefer damp soil and compost. After it rains, large numbers of them can be seen emerging from their shelters to feed on the wet, decaying plant matter on the forest floor. Though they normally have mild personalities, Shroomish will not hesitate to attack foes with Poison Powder of Spore if threatened. By shaking their bodies, they can release poisonous spores from the top of their heads, dispersing them in noxious clouds. Inhaling these spores can cause dizziness, nausea, and numbing pain all around the body. Areas with sizable Shroomish populations often will have signs detailing how to avoid startling wild individuals and how to treat Shroomish poisoning. Notably, these Pokémon are placated and will not release their spores when fed Kebia Berries. They may even be occasionally seen holding these Berries themselves as they scuttle across the forest floor.","Breloom are deceptively skilled fighters. While their arms may seem short and stubby, they actually can stretch quite far to deliver powerful punches on par with pro boxers. Breloom are nimble on their feet, with sprightly footwork that allows them to draw very close to their opponents. As they hop from foot to foot, they scatter toxic spores from the club-like growths on their tails--actually hardened clusters of their own spores. The spores daze and weaken opponents, letting Breloom pummel their enemies with quick volleys of virtually invisible punches. Breloom prefer warm, humid climates, feeding on tree leaves and other living plant matter instead of compost like Shroomish. In large quantities, their spores can cause severe indigestion; one researcher, who was likely under the effects of a hallucinogenic drug, reportedly attempted to eat a portion of a live Breloom’s spore clusters. He described the experience as “trippy,” and claimed to have “the worst stomachache ever.” The Breloom was unharmed by this debacle, if a bit alarmed.","Slakoth sleep for 20 hours a day, only waking up to eat or adjust their positions. Due to their lack of motion, however, they don’t need to consume much; in fact, Slakoth only eat about 3 leaves a day on average before resting again. Generally, Slakoth never change the locations of their nests until they evolve. However, they have been known to travel surprisingly great distances by floating down rivers on logs. Their hearts beat only once a minute, even when potentially in danger. Curiously, despite appearing like sitting ducks, wild Slakoth are rarely ever attacked. Those who see Slakoth loafing around begin to feel drowsy themselves, losing the willpower to attack them. In the event that they do get injured, however, Slakoth can heal themselves by using Slack Off. Their claws allow them to climb trees with ease; however, they more commonly use them to dig into branches to prevent themselves from falling off while dozing. Slakoth live in large groups numbering over a hundred. Such troops are protected by troops of Vigoroth and are centered around single Slaking.","The hearts of Vigoroth beat at a tenfold tempo, with their body producing energy at a similar rate. They can’t sit still for a single second; ceasing movement will stress them out greatly and make them ill. Vigoroth feel a constant urge to go on rampages thanks to their boundless energy. Consequently, they also feel a never-ending desire for food; even when eating, however, they keep moving. Vigoroth don’t sleep, instead spending all of their time running about aimlessly. As they run, they will spin and flail their arms about wildly to burn off more energy, destroying much of what is in their way. Vigoroth defend Slaking colonies in troops, putting their endless energy to use. They chase off intruders from their colonies in large numbers; oftentimes, up to a dozen Vigoroth will pursue single threats until sufficiently far away. Vigoroth are also in charge of foraging. They gather large amounts of food to bring back home, eating constantly as they travel. Whatever they don’t finish eating is piled up at the center of their nests, where their brethren can then feast.","Slaking are also known as “kings of the forest.” They spend their days lying on their backs, eating whatever grass and Berries they can reach without moving. Consequently, rings over a yard (.9 meters) in diameter of barren earth are telltale signs that a Slaking is nearby. Slaking will only move, and reluctantly so, once all the food around them is cleared out. In a colony, there is only one Slaking; should a Vigoroth evolve inthe group, it must battle the current Slaking for dominance. Losing individuals are exiled to start new colonies elsewhere in the forest. The head Slaking of a group has the sole job of reproduction; Vigoroth are in charge of gathering food, defending the territory, and raising Slakoth. However, in the rare event that intruders manage to defeat the Vigoroth, Slaking will rise and show their true might. Standing on their hind legs, they will unleash all of the power they had saved up while lounging around in a single, devastating blow that can easily level entire swathes of forest. Once finished, they will return to their resting, as usual.","Nincada spend most of their time underground; they cannot stand sunlight and avoid it as much as they can. Since they rarely venture aboveground, their eyes are very poorly developed, making them virtually blind. Nincada navigate using their antennae to probe their surroundings. They search for tree roots, which they claws into to suck out moisture, nutrients, and sap. They can spend as long as 10 years underground, making their nests between the thick roots of large trees so they do not have to travel far to find food. Nincada will use their claws to dig out tunnels connecting their nests to other important areas: water sources, other trees, and exit tunnels to the surface should their nests flood from rain. Nincada need to molt their exoskeletons to continue growing. When molting, they will travel up their exit tunnels onto the trunks of the trees they are nesting in. They do this at night, after the sun has gone down. When they near evolution, they molt for a final time, but do not return to their nests afterwards.","Ninjask travel at incredibly fast speeds, so quickly that they are virtually invisible to the naked eye. Because of this, in the past people used to believe that they were invisible. Oftentimes, the only way one can tell that Ninjask are nearby is by the high-pitched buzzing sound they make while flying and the gusts of wind felt by their passing. Ninjask are notoriously difficult to train, refusing orders and emitting their incessantly loud buzzing to annoy their trainers. It is said that trainers must prove their worth to their Ninjask through demonstrations of physical strength, agility, and dexterity in order for them to be deemed worthy of obedience. Listening to their buzzing for extended periods of time can cause headaches, adding to the difficulty of training them. However, those who earn their respect are rewarded with Pokémon so quick that they can dodge virtually any attack through the sheer virtue of their agility. Their favorite food is tree sap; Ninjask can be seen congregating around exposed sap on tree bark, one of the only times they can be seen remaining still.","Shedinja are very mysterious Pokémon; they don’t quite evolve from Nincada, but rather appear when they evolve into Ninjask. They never move or twitch, and don’t show any sign of breathing. However, they float perfectly still, in mid-air, despite only appearing to be hollow carapaces. Many consider Shedinja to be the the final molts of Nincada prior to their evolutions, reanimated by mysterious spirits. Staring into the holes in their backs (where, if Shedinja are indeed shed skins, are where Nincada emerged) is said to steal the spirits of onlookers. This myth is quite obviously untrue, as countless trainers have glimpsed into the holes during battle with no ill effects. Regardless, the myth is still popular among many young, impressionable trainers. Their shells are curiously hard, yet brittle, repelling a wide variety of attacks without even a scratch. However, other attacks--Fire-type moves, for example--negate this mysterious force with ease. Attacks that can break through and damage Shedinja will faint them immediately, no matter how weak.","Whismur normally speak in very quiet murmurs, just barely audible if one strains to listen.  However, if they sense danger, they will begin to cry at an earsplitting volume as loud as jet planes. They use echolocation to navigate dark caves. Curiously, they can breathe using holes near their ears instead of their mouths, letting them to cry continuously without running out of air. Covering their ears, though, will cause them to stop wailing (Whismur can also breathe through their mouths when necessary, but cannot cry through them at the same time). In an increasingly loud cycle, the sound of their own crying will startle them and cause them to cry even more until they simply become too exhausted and fall asleep. By shrieking at such loud volumes, Whismur can cause rocks and stalactites to break off from the ceiling to the ground, trapping and injuring those beneath. Indeed, this is their main form of defense; their incessant wailing simultaneously disorients foes while causing the cave environments around them to come crashing down upon them.","Loudred build power by stomping one of their feet repeatedly on the ground. They attack by bellowing at tremendously loud volumes; their ears act as loudspeakers when they yell, further amplifying their sounds. The shock waves from a Loudred’s Hyper Voice can blow apart wooden houses or tip over trucks. They have very well-developed stomach muscles that allow them to quickly suck in large amounts of air before attacks. After they yell, the sheer volume of their shouting renders them deaf for a short period of time. They are highly vulnerable to retaliation during this period, as they cannot hear incoming attacks. During the mating season, Loudred can be seen engaging in shouting matches with each other in competition for mates. Dueling Loudred deafen each other quickly, but will continue yelling without actually knowing who is louder. Competitions end not when one Loudred is deemed the loudest, but rather when the others simply tire and walk away. Such matches can potentially last for days until the Loudred grow hoarse from shouting.","After the intense shouting trainers endure from Loudred, most expect Exploud to be even louder. However, Exploud are able to control the volume of their voices with ease. Outside of battle, they are no louder than other Pokémon, choosing to communicate with whistles of different volumes and pitches from the various sound-producing organs on their bodies. In battle, however, they reveals their true sonic capabilities. When attacking, their bellows can be heard from over 6 miles (10 kilometers) away, causing earthquakes that can be felt just as far. Before Exploud shout, sharp, high-pitched whistling can be heard as they draw in air. Their can pulverize solid concrete by using Boomburst. Notably, Exploud are popular Pokémon in orchestras and bands. This is because they can imitate virtually any wind instrument using their assembly of pipes and can control their pitch and volume without the need for tuning. Some musicians have also experimented with their “singing,” though this testing hasn’t gone nearly as smoothly.","Makuhita are determined Pokémon; they will fight until their bodies give. Even then, they strive to become strong enough to defeat those that had beaten them. Makuhita learn from their errors; each time they fall, they store energy for evolution and get right back up. They prize their might and work hard to maintain it. They make sure to keep balanced diets with enough calories to for their training and always gets enough sleep to be well-rested. They toughen their bodies by slamming into rocks and trees. Snapped trunks can be found near their training grounds. Distant rumbling in caves is often the sound of Makuhita toughening themselves on stone. Thanks to their practice, their bodies can withstand many powerful attacks. As they grow stronger, they will begin eating more to store energy before evolution. They begin practice in groups in the morning, eat lunch and nap in the afternoon, and then resume training in the evening. Though native to Hoenn, Makuhita have been imported to Alola, where they are celebrated for their purportedly superior strength. Makuhita trainers in the region have developed secret recipes for stews purported to maximize the strength and endurance of their Makuhita. Humorously enough, it is not uncommon in Alola to see Makuhita training their palms on trees and then get flung away after accidentally striking an Alolan Exeggutor. ","Most (though not all) of the fat that appears to be covering the bodies of Hariyama is actually muscle. When they flex, their torsos become as hard as rock. They specialize in open-palm thrusts that can snap telephone poles in two or sending 10 ton trucks flying with one blow. They stomp their feet alternatingly before matches to store power. In particular, they enjoy sparring with large Pokémon and enjoy showing their power by knocking down heavy objects. They are known to stand on train tracks and stop freight trains with their bare hands simply for fun. Hariyama make liberal use of the moves Arm Thrust and Force Palm. In particular, Hariyama take advantage of the latter’s tendency to paralyze foes. They will combo Force Palm with Smelling Salts, a move that is especially effective on paralyzed enemies. By clapping their two hands together around the heads of foes, Hariyama can easily disorient their opponents and leave them wide open to future attacks. Though most famous for their size and bulk, smaller Hariyama can be just as effective fighters by relying more heavily on speed and agility. Older Hariyama retain their immense strength, but prefer to train young Makuhita instead of showing off. These Pokémon have strong senses of etiquette, both in and out of combat, and will congratulate their opponents for a battle well-fought regardless of the outcome.","Azurill use their tails as their main method of travel. Their tails are very rubbery; Azurill will sit on them and bounce from place to place. Alternatively, they may swing them around like lassos and toss them, pulling the rest of their bodies along with them. They can fly as far as 33 feet (10 meters) doing so. Their tails are packed with the nutrients they need to grow and also store the fat they obtain from food. A side effect of this is that their tails are very buoyant. This is helpful for Azurill, who are not very good swimmers, but enjoys playing in shallow water. On sunny days, groups of them can be seen splashing about at the water’s edge. When threatened, they can swing their tails at opponents, buying time to escape. They are prone to crying and will wail when frightened or hungry. When one Azurill in a group cries, the rest will follow suit, even if they don’t know why the initial Azurill was even crying in the first place. They feed primarily on algae, but will supplement their diets with small fish from time to time.","Nosepass rarely move; at one time, it was thought that they were entirely immobile, but studies show that they creep about .375 inches (.953 centimeters) a year. Their noses always points north. Because of this, spelunkers find Nosepass immensely useful while traveling in caves. The reason for this peculiar trait is that their noses are in fact magnetic. Two Nosepass cannot approach each other headfirst, because their noses will repel each other away. Thanks to their lack of movement, Nosepass rarely need to eat, but will feed primarily on stone and metal, drawing out iron from rocks. They will also pull Steel-type Pokémon directly towards themselves, where they can then feed at their own leisure--though they may occasionally run into trouble when they accidentally pull in predators. During emergencies, Nosepass can actually spin part of their bodies rapidly to drill below to safety, though they can only move straight down in this manner. By controlling the strength of the magnetic force their noses exert, they can draw iron objects towards their bodies to use as armor against attacks or to trap unwary foes in magnetized iron. Curiously, the strength of their magnetism seems to correlate with temperature, weakening in warm weather but strengthening on cooler days.","Skitty live in the hollows of trees, though some strays can be found wandering around cities as well. They are easily distracted by moving objects, often following them for long distances away from home. Researchers believe that urban Skitty populations arose from lone Skitty following cars and trucks into metropolises. They have a habit of chasing their own tails, running around in circles until they tire and becomes dizzy. Many people find their behavior cute; consequently, they are very popular pets. However, it is difficult to earn a Skitty’s trust, as they are wary of strangers. They will quickly warm up to anyone who consistently supplies them with food and toys, though. In battle, they will attempt to intimidate foes by puffing up their tails and letting out squeaky growls. This often ends up making them appear adorable rather than intimidating, however. When two Skitty meet, they will immediately touch tails. Once both are comfortable with one another, they will begin to play games of tag by chasing each other’s tails.","Delcatty live life focusing solely on their own needs and desires. They have no set schedules, doing things whenever and wherever they please. For this reason, Delcatty do not have stationary nests, as they sleep wherever they feel like sleeping. As nocturnal Pokémon, Delcatty roam around at night looking for food and shelter; no matter how hungry or tired they are, they will refuse to eat anything they consider vile or sleep anywhere they believe is dirty. They take their appearances very seriously, often spending hours grooming and cleaning themselves. Delcatty are very popular amongst female trainers, who are enamored with their poise. They are often entered into competitions rating their beauty. However, it should be noted that they are virtually oblivious to commands; just as they behave in the wild, “trained” Delcatty will act at their own leisure, attacking only when they feel like it. They prefer avoiding confrontation. If they sense danger, they will simply walk away from the situation. Oftentimes, attackers are too shocked at their callousness to respond.","Sableye live deep within caverns, particularly near veins of precious stones. Because of this, their presence is often used as an indicator of valuable jewels. However, mining in Sableye territory is highly unadvised; Sableye are natural tricksters that enjoy playing “pranks” on lost spelunkers by destroying equipment or altering paths. They rarely attack directly unless their primary food source—jewels—is threatened; they compete with Gabite for resources. Sableye dig holes in cave walls and floors in search of gems and ore, which they crush with their razor-sharp teeth before eating.  Minerals in the ore they eat crystallize on the surface of their bodies, forming various arrangements of gems that can differ between individuals. Their eyes glitter sinisterly when exposed to bright light, such as the beams from flashlights. The unsettling nature of their eyes have led to tales of Sableye stealing the souls of any unfortunate travelers who happen to gaze into them. Sableye move about very erratically, jittering and convulsing with every step as their heads twitch from side to side. This only adds to their eerie demeanors.","Mawile approach foes facing forwards, luring them closer with coy and innocent expressions. Once they come too close, Mawile quickly lash around and attack with their enormous secondary jaws. These jaws are in fact modified steel horns and are not connected to their digestive systems; rather, the iron-hard appendages, which are strong enough to chew through metal beams, simply incapacitate foes for Mawile to consume afterwards with their primary mouths. These horns also enable Mawile to consume some prey considered unpalatable to other predators, crushing them to tasteless mush before eating. In addition to eating organic material, Mawile must supplement their meals with iron and other minerals to maintain their hind jaws. They will use these steel mouths to pulverize rocks into powder to digest them more easily. In a popular (untrue) myth, Mawile possess the ability to turn into human women, seducing men and leading them back to their lairs, where they will then reveal their true forms and feast on their victims. The telltale sign of these transformed Mawile is said to be a gaping, mouth-like hole on the backs of their heads, often concealed by long, dark hair.","Aron have carapaces of solid steel. They live deep within mountains, feeding on iron ore to strengthen their hides. As Aron grow, their periodically shed their armor to grow new sets. The discarded armor is often salvaged by explorers and sold to factories, where they can be melted down and reused. When iron grows scarce, herds of Aron may leave their mountain homes in search of food. This often takes them into urban towns and cities, where they can wreak havoc on iron structures. Aron will congregate around train tracks, bridges, and cars to feast on the abundant metals in them. Thanks to their weight and density, stronger Aron can even topple dump trucks by using Iron Head, providing rich sources of sustenance for their brethren. Most iron mining operations will section off areas exclusively for Aron and their evolutions to feed, hoping to placate them and lessen the chances of them leaving their mountains to feed in urban areas. Since this practice was implemented by federal regulations worldwide, metropolitan invasions have become much less common.","Lairon eat even more iron than Aron, and are also far more territorial. Unlike their communal pre-evolutions, Lairon will fight for sole feeding rights in territories. They will bash heads with one another until one of them is defeated. The sound of their duels can be heard throughout their cavern homes. In addition to digging out iron ore for food, Lairon also drink spring water rich in minerals to fortify their armor. When they comes across springs, they will often drink so much that they will be unable to eat for the rest of the day. Their affinity for ion has led to increasingly common encounters with human miners. As Lairon are highly aggressive Pokémon, miners are advised to abandon their work if approached by one because they will not hesitate to attack if they feel threatened. Once they are satiated with iron, they will generally leave without  causing any more trouble. Lairon enjoy showing off their strength by bashing their heads against boulders. They gauge their power by the size and number of sparks that fly out upon contact.","Aggron are highly territorial, claiming entire mountains as their own. They are very protective of their mountains, going to great lengths to keep them safe. Most obviously, this means fending off intruders that attempt to trespass on their land. However, Aggron will also plant trees, divert streams, or rearrange boulders to clean up their domains. In particular, lone Aggron have been known to restore areas ravaged by rockslides and wildfires back to their former glory without any outside help. Their ages can be measured by the lengths of their horns. One can also estimate how many battles an Aggron has fought in by the number of scars it bears on its metallic hide. They are very proud of their scars, showing them off as mementos of their conquests. Aggron use their horns to dig deep into bedrock in search of iron. Their digging will often expose new veins of iron for Aron and Lairon to consume. Though Aggron will relentlessly thrash those who deface their environments (such as miners and loggers), they will leave travelers who treat the land with respect alone.","Medidite rigorously train their bodies and minds every day on quiet mountains. As part of their training, they impose strict fasts on themselves, eating only a single Berry each day in order to temper their spirits and sharpen their minds. Meditite also practice yoga daily, improving both their physical and mental flexibility. They focus on the art of meditation, honing their control over their own minds and bodies. By concentrating very intensely while clearing their minds of all other thoughts, they strengthen their inner power. However, they have not yet perfected this technique, often losing focus and having to start over again. Because of this, their training sessions may last for days. On rare occasions when Meditite are particularly focused, they may even levitate above the ground for several seconds. In battle, Meditite will put their training to use by using Meditate to power up their attacks. Their keen senses allow them to deftly avoid incoming attacks and then retaliate before their opponents have a chance to react.","Medicham are gifted with a sixth sense thanks to their strict meditation that is said to allow them to see the auras surrounding others and sense their thoughts. They fast to heighten this ability, which grows stronger the more restraint they exert. By entering trancelike states of deep meditation, they can go for over a month without eating anything at all. Medicham can also harness psychokinetic powers, aiding them in predicting the moves of opponents. In battle, they deftly and gracefully leap around the field, evading attacks while retaliating in the same motions. Medicham also have the ability to remain perfectly still through meditation, blending in seamlessly with their surroundings. While they are meditating, virtually nothing is able to break their concentration; even when attacked, they can subconsciously defend themselves with their psychokinetic powers without losing focus. Medicham are often found meditating under trees on mountains. They can be very difficult to spot, however, given their ability to camouflage into their environments.","Electrike store electricity from the surrounding air in their bristly fur. While running, they use this electricity to stimulate their leg muscles, accelerating them to speeds faster than the human eye can follow. However, they can only travel short distances before having to recharge again, making this more of an emergency escape tactic or hunting maneuver than a method of travel. In addition to gathering electricity from the air, Electrike can also convert friction and static they gain from running and rubbing their fur together into usable electricity; they emit a crackling sound while sprinting as their charges build. When the air is particularly dry or a when thunderstorm is approaching, their fur will begin to give off sparks. If the drop if humidity is sudden (such as when exiting a building), they even may release all of their electricity at once in violent showers of sparks. They are fond of rubbing up against carpets and other surfaces that generate lots of static electricity. This is because these surfaces recharge their fur faster than they would normally. Trainers should note that grooming Electrike with metal brushes is dangerous, as metal conducts their fur’s electricity easily.","Manectric gather electricity from the air in their yellow manes. Their fur is bristly and always stands on end thanks to the static electricity they hold. Their manes constantly discharge electricity, even when they are sleeping. When they attack, they concentrate their electricity before releasing it in the powerful Thunder. Manectric can create thunderclouds out of thin air using the electricity in their manes. They are solitary hunters that rarely appear before people. Because of their mysterious nature, in older times people believed that Manectric were born from lightning. This was supported by the fact that Manectric tend to make their nests in spots where lightning has struck, possibly due to the higher level of electrical activity in such areas. Places with Manectric also tend to have more thunderstorms because of how these Pokémon can conjure them. The sparks Manectric discharge while idle have been known to ignite forest fires. Consequently, most habitats Manectric inhabit are devoid of large trees, with only sparse, dry grasses sprouting from the earth. Like Electrike, Manectric stimulate their muscles with electricity in order to increase their running speed. They can also soothe aching limbs with electricity to alleviate soreness and keep sprinting for longer periods of time.","Plusle are almost never found without their other halves, Minun. They loves to cheer on their teammates, creating electric pom-poms out of their own sparks by discharging electricity from their paws. When their allies succeed, Plusle will short out areas all over their bodies to release shower of sparks in celebration. However, if their teammates fail, they will begin to cry incessantly. The sizes of their pom-poms and electric showers grow as matches become more intense. Wild Plusle are playful, but timid, Pokémon. Though they enjoys goofing around, but rarely initiate contact with others. They group together with their siblings, but will pair up with wild Minun when given the chance. Once a Plusle and Minun rub tails with one another, they are essentially bound for life and will never leave the other’s side. Plusle are known for climbing on top of telephone poles to feed on electricity. Once they can no longer hold any more, they will climb back down and share their electricity with Minun, who are not as adept at climbing.","Minun are almost always found partnered with Plusle. Like Plusle, Minun enjoy cheering on their teammates, discharging electricity out of their palms to root for allies with electric pom-poms and shorting out their bodies to release showers of sparks. Unlike Plusle, though, Minun are more confrontational and rash in tense situations. If their teams lose, Minun become upset and angry, even trying to shock members of the opposing team. Only Plusle can calm down their anger. In the wild, Minun will go out searching for Plusle to partner up with; Plusle usually stay with their siblings in safety rather than venture out into the wilderness. Once a Minun rubs tails with a Plusle, they are partners for life. Minun have a fear of water and will hide under the eaves of houses when it rains to avoid getting wet. Some alternative medical practitioners have purported that getting shocked simultaneously by both a Plusle and a Minun will improve blood circulation and vitality. Such a claim has yet to be proven by accepted scientific experiments.","Volbeat become active late in the evening, flying about in large swarms over freshwater ponds. Volbeat congregate in large numbers near single Illumise, attracted by their alluring scent. Using their taillights and led by the Illumise, Volbeat swarms will draw complex geometric figures in the night sky in hopes of impressing them. By flashing and adjusting the intensity of their lights, Volbeat can converse with one another even when far away. When threatened, they will attempt to disorient foes by using Signal Beam before flying off. In a pinch, though, they can also use Tail Glow and power up their attacks to hit deceptively hardl such a tactic takes a lot out of these Pokémon, however, and renders their taillights useless for a few hours. Volbeat take the condition of their ponds very seriously, as the reflections of their swarms’ lights on the water play a major role in their displays. If their ponds become filthy, swarms may attempt to migrate to new, cleaner ones--but only if the resident Illumise approve of the move.","In the evening, Illumise will use Sweet Scent to emit an alluring odor that coaxes Volbeat into following them in flight. They will guide them into constructing complex geometric patterns in the sky with their taillights. The more intricate the design an Illumise can lead its Volbeat in creating, the more highly it is regarded among its peers. Some scientists dedicate their entire careers to studying these mesmerizing patterns, of which over 200 separate varieties have been recorded. It has been determined that their scent-producing glands are located at the base of their antennae; should these glands become damaged, the Illumise will lose control over their Volbeat swarms, which will then disperse in confused disarray. During mating season, Illumise mate with just one lucky Volbeat in their swarms, selected based on the brightness and size of its taillight. The other members of the swarm aren’t fazed by their rejections, however, and will simply wait it out for the next mating season to arrive the following year.","Roselia are serene Pokémon, spending most of their time lounging in the sun. Despite their miniature size, however, they are more than capable of defending themselves. The three horns on their heads can inject a vicious toxin into those foolish enough to try to pick their flowers (which they are very protective of). They can also fire thorns containing a similar toxin as projectiles. Each of their hands can shoot a different toxin; one causes a searing pain that can last for hours, while the other incapacitates foes with an effect similar to paralysis. Those who manage to enrage these normally docile Pokémon may find themselves subject to both of these at once. Their flowers emit a calming fragrance that placates nearby aggressors. The compounds that create this scent are used in many varieties of relaxing perfumes. Healthier Roselia produce stronger aromas. Roselia will drink spring water that is rich in minerals; the cleaner the water, the more vivid their flowers become. Some Roselia are said to develop specially-colored flowers from rare minerals in this water.","Gulpin have huge stomachs that take up 80% of their bodies; in comparison, their hearts and lungs are miniscule. They also have disproportionately large mouths, capable of extending to swallowing things as tall themselves (their stretchy skin and lack of internal skeletons aid them in this task). Gulpin have no teeth or esophagi, so any food they swallow goes directly into their cavernous stomachs. Their gastric acids are some of the strongest natural acids known, capable of dissolving scrap iron within seconds. Because of this characteristic, Gulpin are not very picky eaters, consuming nearly anything that they can swallow. As they digest their meals, gases begin to build up within their bodies, which they release in periodic belches. The fumes they exhale are putrid and overpowering, capable of knocking people out simply from their overwhelming stench. The feather-like protrusions that stick out from their heads are purely for show. During the mating season, Gulpin with longer feathers are viewed as more attractive mates.","Swalot, like Gulpin, have highly elastic bodies. They can easily fit car tires within their mouths and can swallow prey of similar size whole (they lack teeth for chewing). Swalot sweat a highly toxic fluid from pores on their skin. Simply touching them can cause dizziness and nausea, while extended contact can lead to paralysis, convulsions, and even death. Swalot may employ one of a few different methods when hunting. Firstly, they may rub themselves against targets to immobilize them and then swallow them alive and whole. They can also spray foes with their toxins directly ​from their pores. Additionally, they may vomit some of their own stomach acids (which can dissolve nearly anything other than their own stomach linings) onto prey, dissolving them into more a digestible goop. Finally, they can simply use Belch to incapacitate targets with toxic fumes. When Swalot “yawn,” they are in fact preparing to attack. They have poor vision and use their “whiskers” to feel around. These whiskers are prehensile, and are used to shovel food into their mouths.","Carvanha swim in schools in large tropical rivers. Known for their savagery, they have strong, sturdy jaws that can tear apart solid steel boat hulls in one bite. Indeed, schools of Carvanha are famous for sinking many river-going ships attempting to make it to the sea. Carvanha schools mark their territory distinctly, leaving bite marks on the stones surrounding their swathes of rivers. They will only attack ships, people, and Pokémon that enter their territories, but will do so viciously and relentlessly. Carvanha are driven into feeding frenzies upon smelling blood, recklessly attacking anything around them that moves-including other Carvanha. It should be noted that in the unfortunate event of being caught in a Carvanha feeding frenzy, pinching their mouths shut will prevent them from biting; though they can shut their mouths with great power, they cannot open them with nearly as strong of a force. Additionally, Carvanha are only aggressive when in large schools, particularly in groups of five or more. Lone Carvanha are very timid and meek, swimming away from danger rather than attacking. In the wild, Carvanha are known to compete viciously with Basculin for territory.","Throughout the vast oceans of the world, there are no aquatic Pokémon feared more than Sharpedo. Nicknamed the “bullies of the sea” (also “gangsters,” “bandits,” or “ruffians”), Sharpedo are notorious for attacking boats, submarines, and even divers who dare venture into their territories. Their jaws are strong enough to rip apart sheet metal and oil tankers. When their teeth fall off, new ones will sprout up almost immediately in their place. Their skin is unique in texture; rubbing in the direction of rear to mouth, it feels as rough as sandpaper and can cut skin simply by brushing past. In the opposite direction, though, it is as smooth as steel. This quality along with their hydrodynamic body shape allows them to reach speeds of up to 75 mph (120 km/h) by jetting water through their bodies. Though they can only do this for short periods of time, it is more than enough to ram holes into boats or slam into larger prey. Legend has it that there is a Sharpedo as large as a Wailord swimming somewhere in the waters near the Hoenn region, but this has yet to be proven. Superstitious sailors will fashion good luck charms out of Sharpedo horns under the belief that they may help keep them safe on the waves.","Wailmer spend much of their time swimming in the open ocean in pods. On bright and sunny mornings, however, they may begin swimming towards the shoreline. They can survive for short periods of time outside of the water, taking full advantage of this by beaching themselves on the sand to play. By swallowing large amounts of seawater, Wailmer can use their buoyant bodies to bounce around on land. The more water they swallow, the higher they bounce. Due to their sizes, though, they may become hazards for other beach-goers when they bounce. They generally stay far enough away from crowded areas for this to not be an issue, though. Their nostrils are located above their eyes; for fun, they will startle fishermen by suddenly spouting water from them. Wailmer eat tons of plankton daily, filtering water through their sieve-like teeth (actually baleen). If they lose too much of their stored water, they will begin to dry out and become lethargic. Kind beach-goers will often take the time to dump buckets of water onto dry Wailmer to rejuvenate them. According to Alolan legend, pods of Wailmer like to beach themselves because they once were land-dwelling Pokémon--a fact that science in fact supports, though through evolution rather than the mystical transformation by the gods that Wailmer underwent in the myth.","Wailord are the largest Pokémon discovered yet. They swim in pods, swallowing whole schools of fish at once to satiate their massive diets. This can also make them a nuisance for fishermen, who sometimes have to chase them off if they encroach too heavily on their catches. These social Pokémon protect their own; if one member of a pod is attacked by a predator like Sharpedo or Dhelmise, the others will come to its aid and surround the attacker. When hunting, Wailord pods will leap out of the water, landing back down with humongous splashes to disorient prey and make capturing them in single gulps easy. They will also use this tactic to confuse foes. Though they must surface to breathe air every once in a while, they can dive as far as 10,000 feet (3,048 meters) with a single breath. They are slow swimmers, which unfortunately makes them targets for many poachers who value them for their uniquely airy blubber. If attacked, Wailord will jet water at opponents using Water Spout to knock them away. In popular media, Wailord are known for their slow, graceful swimming. Tourists will pay money to embark on guided Wailord-watching expeditions. There is also a popular televised situational comedy starring a Wailord and a Skitty, with their startling size disparity and habitat preferences often getting them into unfortunate situations.","Numel are sturdy Pokémon, capable of carrying loads of up to 220 lbs (10 kg) on their backs. However, they are also rather dim-witted, unable to sense pain in most parts of their bodies. Their humps are filled with molten magma reaching temperatures of 2,200°F (1,100°C). When it rains, their magma cools and thickens, making them slower and more lethargic. When Numel use Fire-type attacks, their humps shrink; if their backs completely flatten, then they have used up all of their magma and must replenish it (in the wild, they do so by drinking lava flowing out of volcanoes; trained can use magma substitutes for Slugma and Magcargo found in most Poké Marts). In volcanic areas during ancient times, humans often used Numel to carry heavy cargo up mountain trails. Such a trend still carries on in some rural settlements today, where Numel farms rent trained Numel to hiking tourists. Numel absolutely cannot stand being hungry; if they begin to feel famished, they will immediately stop moving and will not start again until they are fed.","Camerupt live within the craters of active volcanoes, drinking magma that oozes out from the ground. They store this magma within the humps on their backs, which are actually made of modified bone. When angered, Camerupt will let their lava loose by using Eruption, blasting magma out of their humps at foes. This magma can reach temperatures of up to 18,000°F (10,000°C). Each of their humps essentially functions as a miniature volcano. Every 10 years or so, these humps will erupt on their own, without Camerupt forcing them to. Why this occurs is still unknown, but researchers believe that it may have to do with the building pressure of gases trapped within their bodies. Camerupt are mostly aloof, ignoring anything that doesn’t go out of its way to provoke them. However, they will become uncontrollably angry if something strikes their faces, erupting magma out of their humps recklessly and charging blindly at anything that moves. When Camerupt rampage, they will not cease until they have expelled all of the magma in their bodies.","Torkoal dig through mountains in search of coal. When they find some, they will store it in their hollow shells. In battle, Torkoal burn coal for energy, releasing smoke from their shells and nostrils. The sound they make when doing so is akin to that of a locomotive horn. Torkoal communicate with using this sound, altering its pitch, duration, and volume to convey different messages. The four hexagonal indents in their shells are also speculated to be used in communication; when Torkoal burn coal, these indents glow with varying intensities depending on how much coal they are burning. The speed at which Torkoal expel smoke is indicative of their health, with healthy Torkoal spewing it out quickly and forcefully. ​When threatened, Torkoal will use the move Smokescreen by exhaling black soot out of their orifices. Then, while attackers are blinded by smoke, they will attempt to flee as quickly as they can (albeit, this isn’t very swiftly). Larger Torkoal require more coal to stay active, but can also withstand longer periods of time without any of it; they will eventually become unable to move and die without fuel, however. Torkoal are common sights in coal mines, with dozens congregating around areas of exposed coal.","Spoink are found in mountainous areas near the sea. They wear discarded Clamperl pearls that have washed ashore. Spoink use their pearls to focus their psychokinetic powers; the larger the pearls, the more power they can harness. Thus, they are constantly searching for bigger pearls. Spoink use their tails as springs to bounce around. The shocks from their rhythmic bouncing force their hearts to pump blood through their bodies. Because of this, they can never stop bouncing without risking death. Spoink even will bounce in place when sleeping. Their favorite food is underground truffles. However, they are physically ill-suited for digging them out. Luckily for them, Spoink possess mild powers of manipulation, persuading other Pokémon to dig them for them in return for a share of the meal. If Spoink drop their pearls, they grow tired and lose their abilities. They also will bounce more erratically without the extra weight. They will compulsively steal round objects and place them on their heads until they can find new pearls.","Grumpig can sometimes be seen bouncing on their tails. However, unlike Spoink, they does not need to do this to survive. Grumpig possess the ability to manipulate others. Using the black pearls on their bodies to focus their powers, Grumpig can take control of their foes’ minds. While doing so, they also perform strange, exotic step-dances of sorts that involve hopping from foot to foot and spinning around. Curiously, styles of dancing imitating their manipulation dances have emerged in multiple regions worldwide. In the past, many believed that their suggestive powers originated in their dancing and that performing the dances would gift the dancers with similar powers. In modern times, their powers are believed to have more to do with the pearls that focus their abilities. Grumpig pearls are regarded as precious gems and are sold for very high prices on the black market (whether they maintain their powers is uncertain). Without their pearls, Grumpig are powerless, so they will defend their pearls with their lives. ","Spinda cannot walk in straight lines, instead teetering to and fro as if always dancing (and inebriated); is is said that they believe they are walking straightly, however. Watching them stagger for too long will disorient onlookers; indeed, this is their primary form of defense, as their lurching makes it impossible for foes to aim. Every Spinda has its own set of spots—the odds of two Spinda sharing the same pattern are less than 1 in 4,000,000,000; some enthusiasts try to collect as many as possible. In battle, Spinda weaponize their erratic motions with Teeter Dance, confusing all who observe them. Wild Spinda live in groups of a few dozen. They feed on shoots and Berries (though they have a very strong aversion to Persim Berries). In the evening, groups will begin to dance wildly, teetering and spinning aimlessly. They will continue this strange dancing until the moon rises before collapsing onto the floor in a daze. This ritualistic dancing is believed to be a form of recreation, thought to give the Spinda involved an effect similar to hallucinogenic drugs.","Trapinch live in arid deserts. They burrow deep in the sand and dig out bowl-shaped pits, making their nests right in the centers. Rather than actively going out and hunting for food, Trapinch simply wait for unwary prey to stumble into their holes; the steep sides cause additional sand to fall onto anything that tries to escape, only dragging unfortunate victims further in, where Trapinch await with open jaws. Then, Trapinch will simply reconstruct their pits and wait for new victims to fall in. When faced with particularly evasive prey, they may use their lower jaws as shovels to fling sand at their targets and cause them to lose their footing. To sleep, Trapinch simply burrow underneath the sand of their nests. Their jaws are strong enough to crush boulders as they tunnel. They can survive for a whole week without water; in fact, they often have to, since they spend most of their time waiting in their pits. If trainers accidentally fall into a Trapinch pits, it should be noted that Trapinch have very heavy jaws; if their victims manage to tip their heads over, they will have great difficulty righting themselves up again on their own. This vulnerability also makes them easy prey for smaller predators like Sandile.","Though Vibrava have grown wings upon evolving from Trapinch, they are not yet capable of flying long distances (though they can hover in the air for a few seconds at a time). Instead, Vibrava use their wings for hunting and avoiding predators. By vigorously flapping them, they can generate ultrasonic waves that stun foes, sometimes even knocking them out cold. They may achieve a similar effect by swiftly rubbing their wings together. The sonic waves Vibrava generate can induce severe headaches and fainting in people; their trainers may even need to wear earplugs to avoid hearing loss. Luckily, though, they tend to ignore humans in favor of more manageable prey, though clumsy travelers may sometimes find themselves within range of their vibrations. Once they have stunned their victims, they will vomit acid onto them, dissolving them while they are still alive. They will wait until their meals are partially digested before eating them. If the meal is too large, Vibrava will bury the leftovers beneath the sand to preserve it for a future meal. Many people are unaware that Vibrava evolve from Trapinch because of their striking dissimilarities; some even (mistakenly) think that they are more closely related to Yanma.","Going by names like “The Elemental Spirits of the Desert” and “The Desert Spirits,” it is clear that Flygon are held in high regard by desert communities. By flapping their wings, they can whip up huge sandstorms; they are constantly cloaked in sand wherever they travel. The sound their wings make is eerily similar to that of a singing chorus of women, and it is said to be only sound audible in their storms. Many legends passed down by nomadic desert tribes describe mysterious singing “spirits” that only appear in sandstorms and luring travelers into the dust, never to return. It is likely that the beings are Flygon, hence their nicknames. Their storms hide their locations from enemies, while their “singing” lures in prey. The red covers over their eyes protect their vision from abrasive sand, allowing them to navigate without hindrance. In popular myth, it is said that Flygon will appear to desert travelers in danger, particularly those being attacked by rogue bands of Pokémon or thieves. They will then whisk away the aggressors in sandstorms if the defending parties are not guilty of any wrongdoing themselves. Recent studies show that some Flygon engage in cooperative hunting with Krookodile; the Flygon whip up sandstorms to conceal the Krookodile, who ambush the hapless victim. The two then split the catch evenly.","Cacnea live in arid deserts, surviving on tremendously meager amounts of water. The drier and hotter their environments are, the more beautiful and fragrant the flowers on top of their heads grow; the flowers bloom only once a year, but remain fragrant year-round. They uses their flowers’ scents to attract prey, which they shoot down with thorns using Pin Missile. If this fails, Cacnea can also swing their spiky arms at foes like hammers by using Needle Arm. When they find oases, they will gorge themselves with water, filling their hollow bodies. They can last up to 3o days on this stored water. Cacnea are solitary Pokémon, wandering deserts alone. However, they are not territorial and will allow other Cacnea to pass nearby without conflict. When food is scare, Cacnea can find sustenance by using Ingrain; they dig their roots deep into the sand to suck up nutrients like plants. However, the sustenance they gain from this is ultimately inefficient for supporting them in the long run, so they must eventually hunt and capture prey in order to survive.","Cacturne become active in the dead of night, when desert temperatures often drop to near-freezing levels. They do this to prevent themselves from losing precious moisture in the hot, sweltering sun during the day. Cacturne hunt in packs, but aren’t closely bonded with one another like most pack hunters; their relations are purely task-oriented without personal bonds. In their makeshift groups, Cacturne will follow weary travelers from far behind. If the travelers try and look behind them, the Cacturne will stop moving and pose as motionless cacti. Eventually, the travelers, already weary from the day’s heat, will be overcome by paranoia and collapse onto the sand. It is only then that the Cacturne will approach and attack. Oftentimes, the only trace left after Cacturne attacks are piles of dry bones. It is said that living thousands of years in the sandy desert has turned their blood into sand; although Cacturne “blood” is much thicker than that of most other Pokémon (it is essentially sap), it certainly not sand, even though popular media likes to depict it that way.","Swablu have soft wings with cottony feathers. They have a tremendous desire for cleanliness, cleaning anything dirty they see with their wings. In fact, their need to clean is so crippling that they will be unable to sleep until everything visible from their nests is spotless. Once Swablu tidy everything they possibly can, they will wash their wings in clean, flowing streams. Even if their wings aren’t dirty, they will still rinse them, almost compulsively, every few hours. Swablu love rain,  as it takes much of the pressure of cleaning off of them. However, if their wings become waterlogged, they become unable to fly (Swablu must rest for some time after rinsing their wings in streams before flying). Consequently, they will hide under trees with their wings tucked in during storms to keep them dry. After cold winters, Swablu will fly in large flocks into towns and cities, heralding the arrival of spring. They are unafraid of humans and have a curious habit of perching peacefully on people’s heads like pillowy hats. Why they enjoy doing this is unknown.","Altaria fly high up in the sky, resembling cottony clouds. They catch updrafts with their buoyant wings to rise effortlessly in the sky. They enjoy flying through clouds, blending in seamlessly into their surroundings. When Altaria roost, they fold their wings inwards and preen their feathers to clean them. They do this every few hours to keep their wings from growing too heavy with dirt. Altaria are famous for their beautiful, melodic singing. They trill with light soprano voices as they fly, making listeners feel like they are dreaming. When they see loved ones, they will engulf them with their pillowy wings and begin to hum. The sensation of their wings and ethereal voices will often lull recipients into deep, blissful sleeps. Altaria hate conflict and will try to avoid it at all costs; however, they can launch intense fireballs at foes when threatened. More commonly, though, Altaria will utilize defensive moves like Safeguard and Cotton Guard in battle; they may even occasionally use Perish Song if drastic measures are necessary.","Zangoose saunter around grasslands on all fours; however, they will stand bipedally when preparing to attack. They are most famous for their bitter rivalries with Seviper; if they sense Seviper near them, their fur will bristle and they will stand up, ready to attack. Their feud seems almost genetic, with even newborn Zangoose becoming aggressive when Seviper are nearby. The scars on their bodies are likely from duels with Seviper. They only bare their claws when attacking, leaving them withdrawn outside of battle. These claws are their biggest weapons, capable of slashing viciously into exposed flesh. By using Crush Claw, they can tear deep, vulnerable gashes in their foes’ armor. Zangoose are very agile, capable of dodging attacks while standing up. They have developed resistances to Seviper poison from years of bitter conflict. A popular story tells of a Zangoose and a Seviper, who, against generations of feuding, fall in love. The tragic story ends with both Pokémon dying together, the Zangoose from the Seviper’s poison and the Seviper from its own tail-scythe.","Seviper are covered in scars from feuds with their arch-nemeses Zangoose. Though Zangoose may be more agile, Seviper are more well-defended; both their fangs and tails can secrete a brutal, incapacitating venom. Their tails are as sharp as swords, capable of slashing into foes while simultaneously injecting their venom. When not hunting or battling with Zangoose, Seviper whet their tail-blades on rocks to sharpen them. Seviper coil their long bodies around prey to crush and suffocate them before slitting their throats with their venomous tails. They can also sink their teeth into the necks of more resilient foes. In battle, they will wield their tails like poisonous daggers, using Poison Tail to bring down foes. From years of bitter conflict with Zangoose, Seviper have developed regenerative properties that enable them to recover quickly from even the worst slashes. They can heal grazes almost instantly by shedding their skin; deeper gashes take longer to recover from, but still heal very quickly when compared to other Pokémon.","Lunatone are found near the sites of meteor crashes. Many believe that they have extraterrestrial origins because of this, but studies on them have returned inconclusive. The first Lunatone was discovered in 1963, when a cluster of extraterrestrial objects fell in present-day Meteor Falls, Hoenn. They float using telekinetic powers, becoming active at night when the moon is bright. Their power appears to be connected with the lunar cycle, becoming strongest when the moon is full. It is during this time that Lunatone are most active and commonly seen. As the moon ebbs, so does their strength. When the new moon arrives, Lunatone lose all of their power and hide away until the moon waxes again. Their ominous, glowing red eyes can paralyze onlookers with fear. Staring into them for too long can put observers to sleep. During the day or a new moon, however, their eyes appear faded and dull. In battle, they can harness the moon’s power to use Moonblast. Lunatone may also bolster their defenses by using Cosmic Power.","Solrock were first found in the 196os after a mysterious meteor shower over Meteor Falls, Hoenn. They are always expressionless, but seems to be able to read what opponents are thinking in battle. Solrock appear to be closely related to the sun; they are active during the day from sunrise to sunset, for example. The more sunlight they are exposed to, the stronger they become. When the sun is obscured by clouds, Solrock weaken greatly. On sunny days, groups of them will line up and face the sun to soak in rays of sunlight. In battle, Solrock will spin their bodies rapidly. As they do so, they release bright flashes of light like miniature suns. The faster they spin, the brighter the light they release. Eventually, Solrock will “run out” of light to emit, at which point they will have to recharge by basking in sunlight again. Solrock radiate intense heat as they spin, even when not releasing light. They can also harness the sun’s power in battle by using Solar Beam, or even use Cosmic Power as a more defensive option.","Barboach dwell in muddy water, burying themselves in the muck. Their bodies are covered in a slippery mucus. that prevents bacteria from infecting their vulnerable skin. Additionally, it makes it difficult for foes to grasp them, especially important because Barboach often live in shallow water where they can easily be spotted by aerial predators. If this film dries, they will become weak and lethargic. Some regions hold Barboach-catching contests where entrants must catch the slippery creatures with their hands. Barboach are usually submerged in mud, leaving only their whiskers poking out. Their whiskers are extremely sensitive, acting like radars to help them navigate murky waters. The barbs can also sense passing prey, and can detect smell and taste at the same resolution as the human tongue. Barboach are not very picky eaters and will consume nearly anything they find. They can be seen scavenging the remains of the meals of other Pokémon or eating rotting plant material if food is scarce. In some regions, because of their love for the substance, Barboach are said to have been created from dried mud.","Whiscash are highly territorial, often claiming entire ponds as their own. They are nocturnal, burying into the mud to sleep during the day. At night, they emerge to eat whatever they can find, waiting patiently at the bottoms of their ponds; as long as it is alive, Whiscash will eat it (they will sometimes even consume inanimate objects), along with a healthy gulp of muck from beneath as well. They make their nests by carving out shallow bowls in mud. Whiscash have poor eyesight and instead use their highly sensitive whiskers to navigate their murky surroundings. They are so sensitive, in fact, that they can sense minute vibrations of the earth and alert Whiscash of earthquakes before they even occur. Due to their territoriality, they become very hostile when foes enter their land. When threatened, they will go berserk and thrash about wildly to generate earthquakes with radii of over 3 miles (5 kilometers). They will also generate smaller tremors to scare out potential prey from the silt. It is said seeing a leaping Whiscash is an omen of an impending quake. In popular myth, a huge, oceanic Whiscash is said to be responsible for the world’s tremors. To date, no Whiscash has ever been found in saltwater.","Corphish are widely known as an invasive species, proliferating in nearly any body of water they enter. Originally native to Hoenn, they experienced a surge in popularity as pets when the king of Kalos requested Corphish to populate his garden ponds in the 1700s. Escaped Corphish likely are the root of many invasive populations today. Able to tolerate even the dirtiest waters, they quickly spread; they can now be found in regions like Sinnoh, Unova, Kalos, and Alola in addition to their native region. Their introduction in Alola in particular has been traced back to a pair released by a Hoenn immigrant who could no longer care for them. When Corphish begin populating a pond, they will begin bullying out native residents using their sharp claws; only the hardiest species like Magikarp and Feebas can tolerate the continual harassment. When they pinch foes, they hold onto them for as long as possible. Corphish can eat virtually anything; this, in combination with their pollution tolerance, aggressiveness, quick reproductive rate, and general willpower to survive, has made them great dangers to biodiversity in many freshwater habitats. Many regions have put forward efforts to control Corphish populations, but their hardiness has made this a difficult task.","If Corphish are risks to the biodiversity of aquatic habitats, Crawdaunt are absolute menaces. Being highly aggressive, they will actively chase out all other Pokémon in their territories other than themselves and Corphish; they will even force out competing Crawdaunt to preserve their dominance. In waters where they reside, very few other Pokémon can be found. They enjoy challenging other Pokémon in combat, even foes that are much weaker than themselves; in fact, they seems to enjoy bullying smaller Pokémon even more than defeating larger ones. When Crawdaunt come across other Pokémon in their territories, they will toss them out of the water violently with their claws. They bear scars on their carapaces with pride, indicating how many fights they have been in. They will ram their whole bodies into foes who approach their nests. Crawdaunt are also difficult to raise, preferring to attack for fun instead of battle. They are only vulnerable after molting or losing a claw; they will bury themselves in the mud to hide during this time, becoming uncharacteristically wary of combat. Unlike the claws of their relatives Crabrawler or Clauncher, Crawdaunt claws are said to taste putrid and like mud.","Baltoy were first discovered in an ancient desert ruin, buried in the tomb of a young king. Because of this, it is believed that Baltoy once coexisted with this ancient civilization of humans, possibly revered or worshipped by them. This is further supported by wall paintings found in nearby ruins depicting what appear to be spinning Baltoy. When Baltoy find other Baltoy, they will congregate together and begin crying in unison, drawing more Baltoy to the area. Why they do so is unknown, but some speculate it may have to do with some sort of ancient human ritual ingrained in their memories. They seem to have a particular affinity for congregating around buried tombs and graveyards. Baltoy have spectacular senses of balance, capable of spinning on their feet even while sleeping. At times, Baltoy may be found spinning on their heads instead of their feet. Why they do so is unknown, as spinning in this manner does not improve their locomotion. A few modern scientists have hypothesized that Baltoy in fact have extraterrestrial origins. Though the theory lacks much evidence, it has still managed to gain some traction in popular culture.","Claydol travel about by levitating above the ground via telekinesis; they even sleep while levitating. The “eyes” on their torsos are in fact simply false markings. Their true eyes are the numerous red circles surrounding their heads, each of which acts independently. Their arms are not attached to their bodies, floating freely but controlled by telekinesis. They can fire destructive beams out of the tips of their arms, capable of reducing stone structures to rubble. Claydol began mysteriously appearing nearby ancient desert ruins around the same time the first Baltoy was found. The ruins they hover around date back over 20,000 years, leading many to speculate that Claydol are at least as old. The most common story regarding their origins is that Claydol were originally mud and clay statues created by an ancient desert civilization in imitation of a visitor from the heavens, animated by some mysterious beam of light from space. As ridiculous as the theory sounds, scientists have been unable to come up with a better explanation for the baffling conundrum of their existence. Claydol begin to deform upon contact with water and will protect themselves with barriers of psychic energy if they are exposed during rainy weather.","Lileep can be resurrected from Root Fossils, which are often found in limestone rocks. Lileep are sessile; in ancient times, they rooted themselves onto rocks on the sea floor and waved their tentacles around to capture prey. The two yellow rings on their bells are in fact false eyes; their real eyes are on the tops of their heads, where they intently scan the vicinity for prey. Lileep often hide within large swathes of seaweed, capturing unsuspecting prey swimming through and swallowing them whole. Their tentacles resemble undersea flowers of sorts, attracting victims with their bright coloration and mesmerizing undulations. Once a Lileep roots itself on a rock, it will remain there for the rest of its life, regardless of how strong the waves or currents get. They are believed to have gone extinct roughly 100,000,000 years ago due to the rapidly-cooling climate. As an ice age approached, water temperatures dropped and prey began migrating southwards to warmer seas. Lileep, being unable to move, went extinct as their primary food sources depleted.","Cradily were found rooted on rocks in warm seas. Like Lileep, they have fake eye spots on their bells to deter predators, with their real eyes located on their “true” bodies (their insides are very soft, held in place by the firmer green flesh surrounding it). Cradily can uproot themselves and slowly crawl around. They often nest in shallow waters, rooting to rocks and using their bodies to weigh themselves down and prevent themselves from being washed away by rough waves and tides. When the tide goes down, they roam around beaches to dig up prey from the sand. They can also crawl on the sea floor, using their tentacles to ensnare passing prey. Because Cradily lack teeth, their instead secrete acid from their tentacles to dissolve prey externally before feeding. This acid also paralyzes entangled victims so they cannot escape in the meantime. When the weather grew cold during an ice age and their prey migrated south, Cradily were too slow to keep up and likely went extinct because of this.","Anorith can be revived from Root Fossils found in limestone rocks. It is believed to have existed concurrently with Lileep and Cradily roughly 100,000,000 years ago, even sharing the same habitat of warm ocean reefs. In a process that continues to baffle modern scientists, their “wings” appear to be feet modified for swimming; most other ancient Pokémon adapted aquatic appendages for land, rather than vice versa. Regardless of how they came to be, Anorith travel using these wings to keep aloft, undulating their bodies in an “S” shape to swim surprisingly quickly. To hunt, they hide themselves between rocks on the sea floor, darting out to capture passing prey between their claws. Their mouths are located on their undersides. Scientists still debate why Anorith went extinct, considering that it is was more than capable of following migrating prey. The most likely explanation is that over time, Anorith simply became outclassed by more specialized hunters, dying out from their inability to compete with other predators. In modern times, resurrected Anorith do not fare well if released into the sea because the composition of seawater has changed over the past several millenia.","Armaldo adapted to survive both on water and on land; though they spend most of their time walking on two legs terrestrially, they dove into the water to hunt for aquatic prey, swimming using the two “wings” (really modified carapace plates) on their backs. The smaller, feather-like wings were used for fine-tuning their direction while in the water. Armaldo stab prey with their claws, which are strong enough to punch through solid steel or stone. These claws are retractable, allowing them to streamline their shape while swimming. Their bodies are clad in tough, armor-like plates of chitin that protect them from most attacks. It is not entirely clear why Armaldo went extinct, given their ability to hunt and move around amphibiously. It is likely that their slow speed was the main culprit; though they were versatile in their habitat ranges, their prey likely evolved to become faster with time; other, quicker predators were able to keep up, but the slow Armaldo were not able to match them. Recent studies suggest that Armaldo may in fact be a direct ancestor of some modern terrestrial Bug-types.","Though they may look weak and feeble, Feebas are surprisingly hardy Pokémon. They can survive in weed-choked ponds, even ones with very little water left. However, this does not translate well into battle, where Feebas are unable to do much. This lack of ability in combat, combined with their disheveled and tattered appearances, makes Feebas unpopular choices for most trainers--though a few Feebas maniacs certainly exist. To compound this problem, though they can be very plentiful in many areas where other Pokémon cannot be found, they also have the tendency to cluster in large numbers in very specific locations; despite being weak and defenseless, congregating en masse reduces the chance of each individual of being preyed upon—strength in numbers, essentially. This behavior makes them difficult to locate. Once found, though, their dimness makes them easy catches (though they are rather fast). Because they look quite ragged and unappetizing, though, many predators don't even bother trying to seek them out, allowing them to remain plentiful in their refuges. Feebas live near the mud at the bottoms of lakes; they are notable for being able to tolerate both fresh and salt water and are currently being studied for their hardiness.","Milotic are said to be the most beautiful of all Pokémon; paintings and statues depicting them are common, many of which date back to the early 19th century--a time when artists sought to depict beauty in its most natural form. They live at the bottoms of large lakes and can calm hostile spirits with their mere presence. Sighting Milotic is said to quell all of a person’s conflicts and purify their hearts. They have the ability to float in the air for short periods of time. If they sense bitter feuding near the surfaces of their lakes, they will begin to glow a vivid pink and release mysterious pulses of energy to soothe everything around them. It is said that many wars have been unwittingly ended as sailors on battleships traveling out to sea were calmed by their auras. Milotic rarely surface, but are said to rise from the depths to calm violent hearts above. Their beautiful scales can appear as any color of the rainbow; their hue changes based on the angle at which they are seen. Known as Prism Scales, it was recently discovered that these scales can induce evolution in Feebas under certain conditions. A small but devoted group of trainers have achieved recognition by refusing to evolve their Feebas under any circumstances, citing Milotic as a \"disappointing\" outcome compared to to the humble Feebas.","The Hoenn Weather Institute created Castform with the goal of making a Pokémon that could perfectly predict the weather. They succeeded; Castform alter their form based on the temperature and humidity of their surroundings. Changes in the weather alter their cellular structure. In sunny weather, they become hot, dry Fire-types that resemble the sun; in rain, they become wet, soft, and slippery Water-types that exude liquid when touched and look like rain clouds; in hail or snow, they become cold Ice-types with partially-frozen bodies at 23ºF (-5ºC) and appear as snow clouds. In temperate weather, they revert to their Normal-type forms. Their moods also depend somewhat on the weather. Castform tend to be happy if it is bright outside, gloomy if it is cloudy, and irritable if it is stormy, for example. They can harness the power of the atmosphere with Weather Ball, utilizing their variable typing. Recently, the Weather Institute has discovered that their molecules are very similar to water molecules, a fact that was overlooked during their creation. Their transformations seem to be involuntary and instead depend on how the weather affects the configuration of their molecules. A well-documented experiment placing Castform in freezers, showers, and heaters did not induce a form in any case, suggesting that these Pokémon are influenced by a variety of environmental conditions beyond merely temperature and wetness.","Kecleon are famed for their ability to change their body coloration in order to camouflage into virtually any environment. There is one caveat to this amazing ability, however--the red bands on their bellies cannot change with the rest of them. Still, despite this shortcoming, their ability to blend in nearly seamlessly into their surroundings is immensely useful to them for both hunting and avoiding predators. They can essentially turn invisible at a moment’s notice, making detection extremely difficult for predators who rely primarily on their senses of sight. When hunting, Kecleon blend into foliage and wait patiently for prey to wander by. Then, they lash out their long, sticky tongues to capture victims. Kecleon also change color based on their moods and health; what hue signifies what emotion can vary between individuals, though darker shade tend to correspond to healthier individuals. Their true colors can be revealed by startling them, as they briefly drop their disguises when they lose focus. Devon Scopes manufactured by Hoenn’s Devon Corp. can also be used to spot hidden Kecleon. Humorously, trained Kecleon often feel neglected when unspotted for too long, and may retaliate by refusing to reveal themselves to their trainers altogether--which only exacerbates the issue.","Shuppet live in urban areas around humans, becoming active when night falls. They travel streets and alleys in search of sustenance; Shuppet feed on the negative emotions of jealousy, sadness, hate, and vengefulness. They use the horns on their heads to collect and feed on these emotions. In particular, they will congregate in large numbers under the eaves of the houses of people that hold long grudges. An old Alolan proverb states, \"shun the house where Shuppet gather in the growing dusk.\" Shuppet enjoy pulling pranks, feeding on the feelings of sorrow or disappointment that often follow. In battle, they utilize the negative emotions they collect by pulling off moves like Spite and Grudge. They cannot tolerate light, hiding in the shadows during the day. It is said that though Shuppet may appear evil because of their ability to feed on hateful emotions, they actually act out due to their loneliness. In fact, Shuppet actually can cause people to forgive others by literally consuming their grudges, and some even welcome them for this reason. Trainers who raise Shuppet assert that they can be kind and affectionate if cared for properly, even feeding on positive emotions rather than negative ones.","Banette are found in dark alleys, often near dumpsters or piles of trash. They are said to be abandoned plush dolls possessed by cursed spirits. The zippers on their mouths are the only things containing the spirits; opening them would release the entities, so their mouths are always zipped closed. Banette feel on vengeance and jealousy. They play cruel pranks to generate these emotions in unsuspecting Pokémon and people. Popular legend says that once Banette are brought to life, their sole goal is to hunt down and exact vengeance on the children that had abandoned ​them. Their entire beings are powered by vengefulness. Banette are fond of placing curses on their enemies; by sticking pins into their own bodies, they can use Curse to turn their pain into their foes’ suffering. Many believe that once Banette succeed in taking revenge on their old owners, they will unzip their mouths to allow the entities within to escape to the spirit world and their bodies to revert back into toys, their worldly business now taken care of. Other say that properly caring for a Banette will satisfy the spirit within and cause it to let go of its grudge; the result is the same, with its body reverting back into a harmless doll.","Duskull are nocturnal Pokémon, spending the day resting within tree hollows. They have the ability to become invisible and intangible to pass through walls and solid objects. Duskull feed on the spirits of living beings; once they spot prey, they will chase them down relentlessly until the break of dawn; Duskull cannot tolerate light, so if they have not caught their targets by sunrise, they will reluctantly return empty-handed to their nests. Duskull only have one red eye that floats between their two eye sockets. Making eye contact with them is said to freeze even the strongest people or Pokémon in their tracks. Curiously, they appear to enjoy the crying of young children. They will startle unruly kids by materializing in their bedrooms and then disappearing when their parents come nearby. Because of this, many parents warn their children that Duskull are evil Pokémon that kidnap misbehaving kids. However much Duskull may enjoy startling young children, though, there have been no recorded cases of a Duskull kidnapping any child to date.","Dusclops are feared Pokémon, found patrolling ominous woods once night falls. Their bodies are thought to be completely hollow, with only spectral balls of fire burning within. They are said to absorb will-o’-the-wisps (mysterious balls of light that seem to appear over bogs and marshes) to fuel this fire. Those that gaze into their singular red eyes are said to be able to glimpse these flames--at the cost of their lives, however, as they will absorb the spirits of anyone they make eye contact with. Dusclops can hypnotize foes by waving their hands around in a ghastly manner. Their eyes ​will glow while doing so, and their victims will be forced to do their biddings afterwards. Their bodies are much like black holes, in that they can absorb practically anything. Nothing they absorb, however, has even been seen coming back out. Because of this, no one knows where objects (and beings) Dusclops absorb go. Some believe that they transport these items to the spirit world, while others believe they take them to a purgatory, where they wait aimlessly in limbo for the rest of eternity.","Tropius dwell in equatorial tropical rainforests. The large leaves on their backs can function as wings, allowing them to fly above dense forest canopies in search of their favorite food--fruits. Specifically, their favorite fruit is a close cousin of the Nanab Berry; they almost exclusively consume this fruit (trained Tropius will also eat Nanab Berries with no ill effects, thanks to the close relationship). Tropius have also begun growing this fruit around their necks, possibly because of their highly specific diets. This fruit is sweet and very popular among children. Tropius, being docile and benevolent Pokémon, are often more than happy to share their crops. In the spring, Tropius will release pollen from their necks that fertilizes the trees they consume fruit from. Tropius can supplement their diets by using their wing-leaves to photosynthesize. In recent times, deforestation and pesticide use have put a serious dent in their habitat ranges and primary food sources, putting the Pokémon in danger of extinction. Conservation efforts are underway to prevent this. In tropical regions Tropius are sometimes raised domestically for their fruit; this is especially true in Alola, where Tropius are reputed to grow fruit sweeter than that from other regions.","Chimecho become active in warm weather, flying around on gentle breezes. In cooler temperatures, they rest by using the suction cups on their heads to attach to the undersides of tree branches or the eaves of buildings. They also do this in strong winds to prevent themselves from blowing away. Thanks to their light weight, they can travel far distances on the wind alone. Chimecho defend themselves from enemies by letting loose ultrasonic waves to knock foes away. To deter attackers, they emit cries that echo inside their bodies and sound like beautifully ethereal wind chimes. The sound unsettles foes with its unnaturalness, keeping them at bay. Their tails are prehensile; they use them to pick up nuts and Berries from bushes to eat. They communicate using 7 different tones of their signature cry, each one matching a note of the C major scale. In battle, Chimecho can use Synchronoise to damage other Psychic-types. They oddly seem to have an affinity for areas said to have high levels of supernatural activity.","Absol live deep in mountain ranges, rarely coming into contact with humans. The blade-like horns on their heads are said to have mystical powers; it is purported that Absol use their horns to detect minute changes in the land, water, and atmosphere and learn about impending catastrophes before they happen. Being benevolent (albeit aloof) Pokémon, they will seek to warn nearby villages and towns of disasters. Because of this, in older times, people used to believe seeing Absol brought disasters, not warned of them. They alway seemed to appear before earthquakes, floods, storms, and so on, and were seen as bad omens. Some groups have begun trying to correct this misconception, but because it has become so ingrained in popular culture, it is a difficult opinion to fix. Optimistically, this belief is less widespread amongst the younger generation, and some have even explored heeding the Pokémon's warnings in preparation for natural disasters. Absol have long life spans, with individuals said to regularly live over a century. Notable areas where Absol appeared include Mt. Coronet in Sinnoh and the Giant Chasm in Unova, where Team Galactic and Team Plasma, respectively, enacted their plans.","Wynaut are constantly smiling regardless of how they are actually feeling. Rather than frowning to express anger, they will slap their tails repeatedly on the ground to show displeasure. They live in large herds, traveling while huddled as close together as possible. They only become active at night, spending the day sleeping in dark caves. When the sun sets, they will emerge from their caves to play in the moonlight. The enjoy squeezing up against other Wynaut to increase their own endurance. While doing so, Wynaut teach each other how to strike back with powerful counterattacks like their evolutions. Wynaut enjoy eating sweet fruit, picking them off of trees using their ear-like arms. They are attracted to the fragrance of Berry trees and often can be seen clustering in orchards at night. In particular, Wynaut enjoy eating Liechi Berries, and will eat them exclusively given the chance. This may explain their purported presencs on a fabled Mirage Island, where the rare Berry--and nothing else--is said to grow. ","Snorunt dwell in icy caverns, blending in with surrounding stalagmites and stalactites. They only venture out when there is snow, spending most of the spring and summer inside caves (Alolan Snorunt are more tolerant of heat). They can easily withstand temperatures as low as -150°F (-100°C); they regulate their body heat by shivering, helping them cope with such cold environments. In fact, their diets consist entirely of snow and ice, which they happily munch on while wandering through snow-covered areas. In the fall, Snorunt can occasionally be seen hiding together under piles of fallen leaves. They are quite a few pieces of folklore attached to Snorunt. One legend suggests that seeing a wild Snorunt at midnight indicates heavy snow the following day. Another says that if a Snorunt visits a home, all the members of that household will be prosperous for many generations to come. Indeed, in northern regions, almost all children from well-off families will have encountered a Snorunt at some point in their childhood. Snorunt are rarely found outside of snowy areas; if they wander too far from ice, they may panic and use Hail in attempts to make their surroundings snowy.","Glalie have bodies of solid rock, though it isn't particularly hard for stone. To remedy this, they absorb moisture from the air and cover themselves in icy armor that is tempered so that it won’t melt, even when exposed directly to fire. When threatened, they can bolster their armor by freezing more water from the atmosphere. This ability also has a myriad of other uses. When hunting, for example, Glalie will sneak up on prey and freeze the air around them, entrapping them in blocks of ice. Once their victims are frozen, Glalie then enjoy eating them leisurely. In a less macabre application, they can manipulate and freeze moisture in the air into nearly any shape they desire; this makes them immensely useful in ice sculpting, though chisels are often needed for details. Their bodies are constantly shrouded in shimmering mists of diamond-like ice crystals. As Glalie travel, they leave trails of these crystals behind in the air, which sparkle beautifully in the sunlight. Glalie also leave lines of frost behind them as they float around, coating the ground, trees, or whatever else is nearby in a thin layer of ice. According to folklore, Glalie are born when the souls of deceased hikers possess boulders.","Spheal are often found on ice floes, playing together in small groups. They move faster via rolling than waddling, thanks to their rotund shapes. Their spherical bodies, however, are ill-fitted for swimming; Spheal only enter water to cross to new ice floes, and fumble around clumsily as they attempt to reach solid ground. In warmer weather, when ice floes are scarce, Spheal will shelter themselves in icy caves until winter arrives and icebergs become more plentiful. Their thick, plush fur and insulating blubber keep them warm even as they roll around on ice or swim in polar waters. Spheal clap their flippers together to express happiness. When mealtime arrives, large groups of Spheal can become very noisy as they all clap at once cacophonously. When threatened, Spheal can defend themselves deceptively well by using Ice Ball; they coat their bodies in layers of ice and roll into opponents. As they rolls their icy coverings pick up more snow from the ground and grow in size, hitting harder and harder as they continue to roll.","Upon evolution from Spheal, Sealeo become much more adept in the water. They will dive as often as five times a day into the sea in search of prey. When not hunting, they rest in groups atop of floating ice floes. They use their flippers to break apart chunks of ice that get in their way. Their noses are highly sensitive, both to scents and to textures. When these Pokémon comes across unfamiliar objects, their first instinct is to balance and spin them on their noses. As they do so, they carefully examine their smells and textures to decide whether or not they like them. Sealeo are especially fond of round objects; they often play with Poké Balls, for example. Rather humorously, Sealeo can often be found balancing their rounder, younger relatives Spheal on their noses; most Spheal seem unshaken by this behavior, however, and often even enjoy the horseplay. Sealeo can learn new tricks very easily, particularly those involving the use of their noses. Because of this, they are very popular Pokémon in circuses other performing venues.","Though both Spheal and Sealeo enjoy being in large groups, Walrein are territorial Pokémon. They will fight ferociously with other Walrein over land, with all parties often emerging brutally injured and scarred. Only one Walrein will preside over an entire colony of Spheal and Sealeo. They are willing to defend their colonies with their lives. Their thick blubber keeps them insulated against the icy cold. Additionally, the blubber is also able to deflect attacks aimed at them. Their most prized possessions are their grand tusks. Capable of shattering ice blocks weighing up to 10 tons, Walrein use them to break through ice floes. In battle, one of their tusks may occasionally break off. Though they will eventually grow back, the loss of a tusk can be devastating to their status with others of their species. During mating season, for example, the Walrein with the longest tusks are viewed as the most attractive. Walrein with short or deformed tusks are treated as outcasts and shunned among other Walrein, as they appear unfit to lead their own colonies.","Clamperl have nearly-impenetrable shells, capable of deflecting most attacks directed at them. As a side effect of this, their shells are often covered in nicks and gashes by the time they are ready for evolution. Their main bodies are the fleshy blue muscles within their shells; their “heads” are the pink pearls nestled within. The longer they live, the larger these pearls grow. Clamperl hunt small aquatic prey; they patiently wait for unwary prey to swim by before quickly clamping their shells shut around them. One can tell when they are approaching evolution because their bodies will begin to outgrow their shells, making it difficult for them to clamp their shells shut. Clamperl only create a single pearl during their lifetimes, the one that they use as “heads.” These pearls are lauded as being imbued by mysterious powers that focus psychic abilities when held. When Clamperl evolve, they release their pearls onto the ocean floor. These pearls often make their way to shore via currents, where wild Spoink gather and use them to focus their own psychic abilities. They are also incredibly valuable to collectors, who will pay ten times the price of Shellder pearls for them.","Huntail dwell in deep ocean waters, where little light ever penetrates. Despite this, their eyes are very keen, letting them see clearly even in the murky depths. Their sturdy spines allow them to survive the crushing pressure of the deep. Huntail utilize bioluminescence to capture prey. The spots on their bodies light up to attract food. They are not very strong swimmers, and instead use their fish-shaped tails to lure in prey. The “eyes” on their tails glow as they wave them back and forth, fooling victims into swimming closer. Then, they unhinge their jaws and swallow their victims whole. Huntail swim by wriggling their bodies like snakes. On occasion, one of their teeth may fall off as they feed. They eventually grow the fangs back, but the fallen teeth often end up on shore as Deep Sea Teeth. Huntail may occasionally be found near the surface of the water, but such sightings are extremely rare; the significant difference in pressure from their natural habitats is detrimental to their health, so surfacing Huntail are likely very ill and in need of immediate medical attention. It is said that a Huntail washing up on shore is an omen of bad things to come.","Gorebyss spend much of their time in the abyss, and have developed sturdy bodies capable of withstanding the pressure as a result. However, they are capable of adjusting their internal pressure so that they can spend extended periods of time in sunny, shallow tropical reefs. Gorebyss sometimes feed on seaweed growing between rocks, but they are more well-known for their surprisingly cruel tendencies; they can pierce the flesh of prey with their siphon-like mouths and suck out their body fluids. The drained carcass then sinks to the ocean floor, where it provides valuable sustenance for benthic scavengers. Despite this unsettling feeding method, Gorebyss are lauded as beautiful and graceful swimmers. Watching them swim is intensely mesmerizing due to their impeccable form. In the springtime, their bodies turn a more vivid pink as the water temperature rises; their coloration gets brighter in warmer water, turning to an absolutely brilliant hue in tropical regions like Alola. As Gorebyss swim, they occasionally shed a few of their pink scales. These scales find their way to shore as Deep Sea Scales. Thanks to their sturdy bodies, Gorebyss are able to withstand powerful attacks that few would expect them to be able to.","Relicanth are an unbelievably ancient species, long believed to be extinct until one was accidentally discovered on a deep-sea voyage a few decades ago. Fossil records show that they have been around for at least 100,000,000 years (making them concurrent with the likes of Lileep and Anorith), and have miraculously remained essentially unchanged since then, as they have adapted to fit their ecological niche quite well. They lack teeth, instead filter-feeding on microscopic organisms. Their scales are as hard as rocks, with a texture similar to craggy boulders. Their bodies are dense and packed with fat, allowing them to survive the immense pressure of the deep. Relicanth have the odd tendency to “walk” on the sea floor by using their pectoral fins as “legs”. They are nocturnal Pokémon, spending most of the day in underwater caves where the water is cooler so that they expend less energy regulating their body heat. At night, they emerge to filter-feed. Though rather slow, Relicanth are more than capable of defending itself when threatened with the powerful Head Smash. Their scientific name, Latimeria anciens, comes from the name of the scientist who rediscovered it.","Luvdisc live in the shallows of tropical seas. They swim in large schools in coral reefs, nesting in shed Corsola branches. During breeding season, the water appears a vivid pink as thousands of Luvdisc school together beneath the waves. They are famous for their heart-shaped bodies, spawning a variety of legends around them pertaining to love and affection. It is said, for example, that beachside couples who are fortunate enough to spot Luvdisc in the water will be blessed with eternal love. Some people gift their significant others Luvdisc to celebrate honeymoons and anniversaries. Luvdisc have a curious habit of congregating near couples out at sea, tailing them all the way back to shore. Heart Scales, coveted by collectors for their iridescent beauty, are shed by Luvdisc. A few centuries ago, these Pokémon underwent a brief but unfortunate period of overfishing when their scales were purported to guarantee one success in romantic endeavors. During mating season, pairs of Luvdisc can often be seen “kissing” as part of a complex mating ritual that bond them together for life. In a macabre mechanism of sexual selection, lone Luvdisc despairingly float near the surface, where they become easy prey for Pelipper.","Bagon can be found in caverns or near cliffs, canyons, and other areas with stark differences in elevation. This is because their favorite pastime is jumping headfirst off of ledges. They are motivated by a deeply instinctive desire to fly, more than they want to sleep or even eat. Because of this, Bagon spend most of their days futilely jumping off of cliffs in attempts to become airborne, only eating and sleeping when their bodies can no longer handle the exhaustion. Their heads have developed “helmets” as hard as tempered steel that protect them from being injured during their dives. Every few hundred jumps or so, they will take out their anger at not being able to fly on nearby boulders, which they will smash into pebbles with their hard heads. They are very powerful despite their size. In particular, their neck muscles are very well-developed, helping them smash their heads into foes. Recent studies show that this repeated bashing may actually be necessary to promote the growth of certain cells in their bodies that facilitate evolution. As this event approaches, Bagon will begin to eat much more than normal, storing energy in preparation for the big event.","Shelgon have rigid and sturdy armor that is as hard as iron; most attacks simply bounce right off of it. Their shells are made of a material very similar to bone. Though very tough, their carapaces are also heavy, making them sluggish. They rarely eat, relying on the energy they stored as Bagon prior to evolution. They toughen their own willpower and become hardier through this fasting as they prepare to evolve. Inside their shells, their cells are rapidly multiplying as they begin creating new bodies. Once Shelgon are ready for evolution, their shells simply peel right off as Salamence emerge from within. Shelgon are a very hardy species that can survive in most climates. They are resistant to both extreme cold and heat thanks to their insulating armor. However, they avoid deep water at all costs; their heavy shells render them unable to float and their stubby limbs make it impossible for them to swim. Because of this, one may occasionally find them stranded on rocks in canyon rivers, having jumped from above as Bagon.","Upon evolution, Salamence have shed their shells and achieved their lifelong goal: flight. Naturally, they take great advantage of this, spending most of their spare time simply soaring about in the air and not landing until they physically can no longer stay aloft. While flying, Salamence may express their joy by spouting flames out of their mouths. They are highly territorial, going on tremendous rampages when their territories are challenged. They can easily level swathes of forest using their viciously sharp claws and broiling flames. In ancient times, these Pokémon were known for razing entire villages; those who could defeat Salamence in their caves were lauded as heroes for defending their homes. They can fly very quickly, but only for short periods of time. Popular culture details that their great desire to fly caused their cells to mutate and their wings to sprout. Because of this, these Pokémon have become symbols of achieving one’s desires: Bagon represent having dreams, Shelgon represent enduring hardships along the way, and Salamence represent finally achieving one’s goals.","Curiously, Beldum have no blood in their bodies, instead using magnetism to transport minerals within themselves. They generate magnetic forces that repel them from the earth’s natural poles, allowing them to float. All the cells in their bodies are magnetic, though they can control the strength of the magnetic forces they generate. They can communicate with each other over long distances by sending magnetic pulses. When close together, they can also use telepathy to converse. Because of this, Beldum in swarms will move together in perfect unison. They can sleep at any angle, even upside-down or sideways; they often anchor themselves to the faces of cliff when resting by using the claws on their rears. When threatened, Beldum will tackle foes head-on using Take Down; though this technique appears to be the only attack they can utilize in battle, their density and weight mean that their headbutts are usually more than enough to deter attackers. They will also use their magnetism to draw in and slash at metallic enemies, and will release a magnetic pulse if surrounded that can disrupt nearby electronics.","When two Beldum fuse together, they evolve into Metang. They join their separate brains via magnetic nervous systems to utilize psychokinetic powers at double strength. Like Beldum, Metang float above the ground using magnetic force. They can fly around quickly, easily reaching speeds of over 60 mph (100 km/h); when they do so, they rotate their arms so that their claws face rearwards like thrusters, streamlining their silhouettes. These powerful claws can tear through thick iron sheets like silk. Their bodies are incredibly hard; crashing straight into jet planes wouldn’t scratch them. Their two separate brains do not make them more intelligent than Beldum, but do make them think twice as fast; Metang are very useful for solving complex equations or cracking passwords through brute force, as they can use both of their brains to test possible solutions in half the time. In battle, Metang have can wield a much wider variety of attacks their pre-evolutions, using moves like Metal Claw and Zen Headbutt to take down foes. They will chase down prey and then grasp them tightly with their two claws to bring them down.","Like how two Beldum fuse to evolve into Metang, two Metang fuse to evolve into Metagross, granting them a total of four brains working in unison. This gives them more raw computational power than a supercomputer. They use this ability to analyze situations in battle, factoring in aspects such as accuracy, probability, and even physics to mathematically determine the best possible course of action. Physically, they aren’t lacking, either, capable of pummeling foes down with the powerful Meteor Mash. Their iron-hard bodies can weather most attacks with ease. They use their heavy bodies and sharp claws to pin down prey, consuming them with the mouths on their undersides. By tucking in their four legs, Metagross can hover in the air via magnetic force. Though this is faster than walking, it is also more tiring. Like Metang, Metagross are immensely useful to scientists for calculating difficult equations--Metagross can even compute twice as quickly as Metang. The crosses on their faces grow with age; the larger the crosses, the older their owners are.","Long ago, in the snowy forest of what is now Snowpoint City, Sinnoh, a great volcano threatened to erupt and destroy the forest. A mysterious bright blue light appeared, and four Pokémon emerged--Regigigas and its three guardians. Regigigas crafted each of its guardians out of raw materials, creating Regirock out of stone. The Pokémon stopped the volcanic eruption and saved the forest. After this, Regigigas sealed itself away and turned itself into stone, sending its protectors away to a distant region; anyone who wished to awaken it would have to bring back its guardians as well. This legend, taken from the Snowpoint Temple in Sinnoh, then connects to the Regi myth of Hoenn; Regirock was one of three Pokémon sealed away for being too powerful, transformed into a column of stone. The rocks making up its body come from all over the world, giving it a patchy appearance. If Regirock is injured, it simply repairs itself with any nearby stone it can find, hence its varied composition. Regirock communicates with others by flashing the lights on its head. ","The second of Regigigas’s three guardians, Regice also helped stop the volcano in what is now Snowpoint City and was sent off to Hoenn, where it was sealed away for being too powerful. As it patiently awaited for Regigigas to awaken, it transformed itself into a solid column of ice. Along with the other three Regis, Regigigas is said to have crafted Regice by hand, in this case using pure, tempered glacial ice. Regice’s body remains at a freezing temperature of -328°F (-200°C), cooling the air around it to a similar temperature. Regice can control this frigid air, using it to selectively freeze parts of its surroundings. Its body is so cold that it is said not to melt even when submerged in lava. The ice composing its body was curiously discovered to be identical to ice core samples taken from the South Pole, particularly the layers concurrent with the last major ice age. This has led to the theory that Regice, along with the other three Regis, was created some time during that period. Like its brethren, Regice communicates by flashing the lights on its head.","Registeel is the last of Regigigas’s three guardians, crafted by Regigigas from some unknown type of metal. Its body is harder than any known substance, believed to have tempered for thousands of years by immense underground pressure; it also expands and contracts easily. Curiously, though its body is so hard that it cannot be scratched, it is also hollow. More recent studies suggest that its body composition contains materials not found on Earth. It is speculated that Registeel was created from the metals found in fallen meteorites, which Regigigas then tempered underground. Along with its brethren, Registeel is fabled to have stopped the eruption at modern Snowpoint City before being sent away to Hoenn, where it was locked away for being too powerful. It is said to have transformed into a pillar of iron as it waited. Registeel communicates by flashing the lights on its head in varying patterns. To date, no one knows how Registeel or the other Regis feed, as all of them lack mouths or other orifices through which food may enter their bodies; they may not eat at all.","Latias is a rare Pokémon, very rarely sighted by people. It is capable of understanding human speech and is very sensitive to the emotions of others. It flies away from hostility, ruffling its feathers and emitting a shrill cry when threatened. Latias can communicate telepathically with others, but will only do so with individuals that have no intent to cause harm. Its body is covered in a glass-like down that curiously can bend in a way that refracts light and essentially makes Latias invisible. It can also use this ability to alter its appearance, often taking the form of a young human girl. Latias’s affinity for empathy allows it to use a strange ability known as “sight sharing;” it can allow others to see what it sees, and vice versa. It is capable of using the move Mist Ball in battle, a technique making use of its refractive down. It is said that Latias live in small herds, but no one knows how many exist (there may even be only one). Latias is said to share a strong, sisterly relationship with Latios as well as a connection with the Soul Dew, an orb said to hold the soul of a deceased Pokémon.","One half of the so-called “eon duo”, Latios can understand human speech and make use of telepathy, but is nevertheless rarely encountered by humans. It can also make use of “sight sharing” to allow others to see what it sees or thinks. Unlike Latias, who is rather timid, Latios is distant and aloof; it doesn’t often make deep connections with others, and is said to only share a deep bond with Latias (who is said to be like to a younger sister to it). It is said that Latios will only open its heart to the most compassionate trainers. Latios dislikes fighting, but in battle is more than capable of defending itself with a burst of light by using Luster Purge. By tucking in its forearms, it can streamline its shape and fly faster than a jet plane. Like Latias, it is believed that Latios can change its appearance illusorily. While Latias is guided mainly by its emotions, Latios relies on its intelligence; it is said that both Pokémon need each other to prosper because of this duality. Latios shares a strong connection with the Soul Dew; the orb seems to heighten its powers (or Latias’s) when held.","Kyogre is said to rest at the bottom of a deep trench. It is thought to be the ruler of the seas, bringing about torrential downpours and titanic tidal waves to expand the ocean’s reach. Hoenn legend details that when the earth was still young, during the Primal Age, Kyogre was locked in a cataclysmic battle with Groudon, ruler of the land. As Groudon summoned parching droughts to dry away the oceans and create a world of only earth, Kyogre created great storms to flood the whole globe with water. The two battled on endlessly; the entire world was in constant turmoil. It was not until Rayquaza appeared before the feuding giants to calm them that they ceased fighting. Kyogre retreated to a deep ocean trench to slumber and assumed a weaker form. The shape of the world today is the result of this great fighting. It is said that awakening Kyogre again will cause it to undergo Primal Reversion and drown the world endless downpours; some believe that this actually happened not too long ago in human history, forcing Rayqauza to reawaken and calm it.","Groudon is thought to slumber deep underground in a magma-filled cavern. It is said to be the ruler of the land, capable of summoning great droughts to dry up water and cause volcanic eruptions to expand the continents. Its mere presence is said to generate such an intense heat that all the surrounding moisture is immediately vaporized. According to the Hoenn legend, long ago in the Primal Age, Groudon was locked in a titanic battle with Kyogre. Groudon sought to expand the continents while Kyogre desired to widen the seas. Rayquaza is said to have ended the conflict by soothing both Pokémon. Groudon is believed to have retreated to a pool of magma in a deep subterranean cavern, assuming a form with reduced powers; some say that it has awakened once since, this time alongside humans. Groudon is responsible for the shapes of the continents today. It is said that awakening Groudon from its slumber would cause it to undergo Primal Reversion and summon eternal droughts, drying up the entire world into an uninhabitable wasteland.","Rayquaza is said to have existed for hundreds of millions of years, ever since the Primal Age. It is thought to dwell high up in the ozone layer over the clouds, rarely descending to the earth. Many speculate that it feeds on dust, water vapor, or even meteorites, which are through to fuel a Mega Stone-like “mikado” organ in its body. Due to its habitat, Rayquaza is almost never seen by humans; even when it is, it is often mistaken for a comet soaring through the sky. This Pokémon was only recently discovered, when modern technology enabled humans to travel into space; strange behavior in air currents and cloud patterns led to its eventual discovery. In the Hoenn myth, it twice calmed Kyogre and Groudon during their titanic conflicts (once at the end of the Primal Age and again after a crashing meteor released natural energy that revitalized them), clearing the skies of both drought and storm before sending them off. It is said that should something ever happen to Rayquaza, both Kyogre and Groudon would rise and resume their battle, destroying all life on the earth.","Jirachi is said to slumber somewhere deep in the mountains, only awakening once every 1,000 years. Its awakening coincides with the appearance of the Millennium Comet in the skies above, waking when it can first be spotted and returning to sleep when the last portion of it disappears. This period appears to last for exactly one week. Once Jirachi wakes up, it is thought to grant any wishes written on each of its three tags; this likely means that it can at most grant 3 wishes each time it wakes. While Jirachi is asleep, it covers itself in a large, crystalline shell. It can fend off attackers without waking by using powerful moves like Doom Desire. Jirachi is also said to awaken if one sings to it with a “voice of purity.” Once awake, some believe that it can grant any number of “small” wishes (conjuring trinkets and food items, for instance) to those pure of heart (though large wishes can still only be granted via its tags). Before Jirachi returns to its slumber, the third eye on its chest will open up and begin to absorb energy from its surroundings. It then slowly uses this energy up it sleeps.","Deoxys is said to have originated as an extraterrestrial virus that came to earth via a meteor crash. As the meteorite was being examined in a laboratory, a laser hitting the virus mutated it into Deoxys. Deoxys sports a number of abilities based on its curious origins. It can regenerate parts of its body with ease, for example. It can also morph its helical hands into prehensile arms. Deoxys can create clones of itself to carry out tasks, though the clones are weaker and lack crystalline organs on their chests (believed to be their brains). This organ can also shoot lasers for some inexplicable reason. It has psychokinetic powers, letting it use moves like Psycho Boost. Deoxys has an odd connection to auroras; one appears each time it changes forms, for instance. It is said that it uses them to communicate with its clones or even to extraterrestrial beings. In Attack Forme, Deoxys’s offenses are greatly heightened at the cost of its defenses. In Defense Forme, its cells mutate to absorb most standard attacks. In Speed Forme, it streamlines its body to move nearly as fast as sound.","Trainers starting out in the Sinnoh region may choose Turtwig as their starter Pokémon. As Very mild natured creatures, Turtwig are neither fussy nor egregious, making them popular choices among laid-back trainers. Turtwig rarely eat solid food (though they do indulge in Berries from time to time), gathering most of their energy via photosynthesis primarily through the leaves on their heads. The “shells” on their backs are actually layers of hardened soil. Turtwig must drink lots of clean water to keep their shells from becoming too dry and cracking. The shells of healthy Turtwig should feel moist to the touch, but not so waterlogged that they crumble when prodded. When Turtwig are thirsty, their leaves will wilt. Recently, researchers have discovered that their entire bodies can in fact undergo photosynthesis, allowing them to survive even if their leaves are damaged. Because of this, they are constantly enveloped in layers of clean oxygen. Thanks to their easygoing personalities, Turtwig have remained popular choices for trainers in Sinnoh for decades.","Grotle live in forests near springs, rivers, and other sources of clean water. They are heavily reliant on fresh water to keep their soil-based shells healthy; because of this, they will constantly search out new water sources in their forests. Each Grotle is said to have its own personal spring to reliably obtain water from. Grotle are benevolent Pokémon, often carrying tired, smaller Pokémon on their backs to their springs so they can rejuvenate themselves. Their bushes, which are rooted in their earthly shells, occasionally grow Berries or nuts. Avian Pokémon gladly perch on their backs to consume their fruit. Grotle don’t mind this, as they are easygoing Pokémon. During the daytime, Grotle will leave their shady forests for open fields and clearings. As they bathe in direct sunlight, the bushes on their backs photosynthesize energy for them to use. In cloudy weather, Grotle will forage for Berries in the forest as they wait for the skies to clear. It is said that Grotle have an innate ability to find clean water, making them popular choices for forest travelers.","Trainers who raise Turtwig into Torterra find that their thin, earthy shells have developed to support entire ecosystems. Torterra do not move around often, gathering most of their energy from photosynthesis via the trees and other plant life on their backs. Because of their sedentary nature, the environments on their backs often becomes the homes of smaller Pokémon who nest within the miniature ecosystems. Some Pokémon spend their entire lives on their backs, from birth to death. When groups of these Pokémon migrate, it looks like entire forests are moving. Some regions have myths detailing that the entire world in fact rests on the shell of a gigantic, immobile Torterra. Though typically docile, Torterra can retaliate powerfully when they or the inhabitants of their shells are threatened by using the devastating Wood Hammer. Thanks to their curious combination of peaceful demeanors and tremendous offensive and defensive capabilities in battle, Torterra have been and likely will remain reliable partners for Sinnoh trainers for years to come.","Chimchar are popular starter Pokémon in Sinnoh due to their vivacious, carefree natures. They are “balls of energy”, so to speak; they love to play around and have fun, even when in battle. They are very agile, capable of leaping across ravines and scaling up cliff faces in mountains. Chimchar are social Pokémon, almost always found with others of their kind leaping around on trees and boulders. The fires on their rears are fueled by gases within their bodies; as long as they can continue supplying gas, the flames won’t go out, even in rain. When Chimchar are sick, however, they have trouble producing enough gas to keep their fires burning; their flames will sputter and burn weakly as a result. Their fires will only go out when they are asleep, likely to prevent themselves from accidentally igniting brushfires while resting. Their playful natures also unfortunately carry into battle; they will often goof around and not take commands seriously. Despite this, their joyful attitudes and agility makes them popular choices as starters in the Sinnoh region.","Like Chimchar, Monferno love to play around. However, they have become much more perceptive of the situations they are in and have learned to handle themselves more seriously in battle. Monferno are adept fighters, using both their flames and fists to defeat opponents. They can take advantage of their environments to the fullest extent, jumping off of walls and ceilings to attack foes aerially from unexpected angles. By enlarging the flames on their tails, Monferno can make themselves appear bigger to intimidate attackers. They also use this technique for spacing, warding foes off by making their flames bigger or drawing them closer by feigning exhaustion and weakening their fires. In the wild, Monferno live in packs of roughly a dozen members each with rigid pecking orders. Individuals are ranked based on the sizes of their flames when fully lit and the brightness of the blue “masks” on their faces; Monferno with the largest flames and the brightest masks are ranked the highest. Monferno in troops train each other by sparring in mock fights.","Those who chose Chimchar at the beginnings of their journeys will find that their happy-go-lucky, carefree Pokémon have evolved into disciplined, skilled fighters. Infernape practices a unique form of martial arts involving all of their limbs. They use their great agility to toss foes around while pummeling them from all angles. They are capable of cloaking their limbs in flames to scorch foes with physical attacks. The crowns of fire on their heads burn more intensely as they become more heated in battle. These flames cannot be extinguished and are said to represent their undying, fiery spirits in combat. Outside of battle, Infernape retain the playful demeanors of their pre-evolutions. They will quickly assume more somber personas, however, when threatened, as their battling spirits overtake their bodies. They can assail opponents with powerful moves such as Flare Blitz and Close Combat in battle. With their vivacious natures and superb combat skills, it is no wonder that Infernape continue to be common choices for Sinnoh trainers.","Trainers who choose Piplup at the starts of their travels in Sinnoh will soon find that though cute, they are also very prideful. They will refuse to accept food or shelter given to them by others, including their trainers. Instead, they will adamantly find their own food and stubbornly sleep outside rather than indoors or within their Poké Balls. Piplup are far more adapted to aquatic than terrestrial life; they can dive for up to 10 minutes at a time without coming up for air. On land, they are rather clumsy, falling flat on their faces often. However, these tumbles don’t hurt their pride, and they will simply continue walking with their heads held high (literally). Piplup are covered in thick down that insulates them against their chilly northern environments. They almost always keep their chests puffed up as a display of pride. Piplup are difficult to train, as they are too proud to take orders from trainers, and it takes much effort to bond with such prideful Pokémon. However, their resilience and cute appearances make them popular starter Pokémon in the Sinnoh region.","Prinplup are solitary Pokémon; like Piplup, they are prideful and consider themselves too important to rely on others. Their wings are deceptively hard, capable of snapping trees with single blows. They are found in icy polar waters, spending their time diving beneath the ocean’s surface. They nimbly chase down prey underwater before bringing their meals back to the surface. When not swimming, Prinplup can be found resting on icebergs and ice floes. In the water, they use their hard wings to break apart ice as they swim. It is believed that their coloration makes them harder to spot in the water, allowing them to ambush prey. From below, their light blue feathers blend in with sunlit waters, the white spots breaking up their outlines. From above, the darker blue shades match that of deep sea waters. When two Prinplup meet, they will engage in displays of dominance to assert control over disputed territory. By puffing out their chests and waving around their wings, each Prinplup will attempt to appear larger than the other in order to “win” the fight.","Once Prinplup evolve, they retain their prideful personalities as Empoleon; trainers who have raised them from Piplup will have finally earned their respect and loyalty. Traded or wild-caught Empoleon, on the other hand, are notoriously difficult to train due to their pride. Empoleon live in small groups. While each member retains its own individuality and sense of self-worth, they have learned that teamwork in hunting yields far superior results when compared to solitary attempts. The Empoleon with the largest horns on their heads are the leaders of the groups. Empoleon can swim as fast as a jet boat, using their steel-hard wings to slice through ice floes. They are too proud to involve themselves in petty disputes, instead appearing aloof in most conflicts; however, they will viciously attack anyone that hurts their pride with the powerful Hydro Pump or devastating slashes with their wings. Though known for the hard work it takes to train one, their strength and willpower have made Empoleon mainstays for Sinnoh trainers able to handle the challenge.","Starly are quite easily one of the most abundant species of Pokémon. Though naturally found in forests and mountains, their hardy natures have also made them common sights above towns and cities as well. Starly fly in large flocks, with larger groups known to blot out the sun as they migrate through populated areas. Alone, Starly are rather unremarkable Pokémon; in flocks, however, groups of them can beat their wings in unison to whip up windstorms. Their small wings are strong in comparison to the rest of their bodies, enabling them to fly for long distances. There appears to be a limit on how large flocks of Starly can be, though researchers are not sure exactly what this number is. After a certain size, Starly will begin bickering and scatter in different directions, splitting off into separate flocks. The Pokémon have very strident cries; their cacophonous singing can cause large disturbances in urban areas. Though primarily insectivorous, Starly will also feed on fruits and nuts from time to time.","Like Starly, Staravia are rarely encountered alone, as they are almost invariably found in flocks with others of their kind. It seems that Staravia are aware of their weakness alone, hence their reluctance to engage in any kind of solitary activity. Staravia flocks stick together, with members being able to recognize each other on sight. They are territorial, staking out swathes of forest and defending their land from others. Should two flocks encounter each other, they will begin to bicker and engage in fierce aerial fights over disputed territory. The battles only end once all members of one of the flocks have been knocked out of the sky. Staravia feed mostly on insects. While Starly tend to go after slow, grounded prey like Wurmple, though, Staravia can seize aerial insects in mid-flight. They occasionally indulge themselves in fruits and nuts found within their forest habitats. Lone Staravia can easily be recognized by their shrill, harsh cries. They will not stop crying until they find their flocks, much to the chagrin of nearby residents.","Upon evolution, Staraptor leave their flocks to continue life as solitary hunters. They are aggressive Pokémon, known to challenge foes much larger than themselves. Their wing muscles and talons are very strong, enabling them to take down opponents with ease. Staraptor are territorial and will defend their land with all of their strength. Even when injured, they will continue to ferociously fight back attackers. Unlike Starly or Staravia, Staraptor are carnivorous, feeding on fish and small mammals. Their talons are capable of carrying smaller Pokémon all the way back to their nests. They pride themselves on the arrangement of their head feathers, called “combs.” They will viciously attack those who dishevel them with the powerful Brave Bird. During their spare time, Staraptor can be seen preening and adjusting the feathers in their combs. During mating season, these combs are used to attract mates. Larger, glossier combs are considered more attractive, which is why they spend so much time fussing over their looks.","At a first glance, Bidoof appear rather dull, clumsy, and aloof to their surroundings. A closer examination, however, reveals that they are in fact quite the opposite. Found nesting near streams and rivers, Bidoof are surprisingly agile for their size and shape. Though their swimming isn’t stellar, it still is respectable for non-Water-types. Perhaps their most important trait, however, is their industriousness. Bidoof are exceptionally hard workers, laboring from dawn to dusk as they build and repair nests on the riverside. Even when finished with this task, they will gnaw down logs for their evolutions Bibarel to use in their dams, still intent on helping out. It is no surprise, given this, that diligent workers are “as busy as Bidoof.” While Bidoof work, they focus all of their attention on their tasks, ignoring everything else around them. This has given them reputations for being unaware of things happening to them. Bidoof routinely whittle their teeth by gnawing on logs and rocks. Recently, it was discovered that their front teeth grow at the same rate as that of Rattata.","Upon evolution, Bibarel retain their industrious natures. They trade in some of their terrestrial motor skills, however, for aquatic agility; while clumsy and slow on land, they can swim swiftly through flowing rivers (roughly as fast as Feebas, which is impressive given their unwieldy body shapes). Bibarel make their nests by damming up rivers with logs and mud. They spend their days cutting down new trees to patch up holes in their dams while making sure that they will not overflow. This rigorous inspection process is highly effective; within the last decade, there have been fewer overflows in Bibarel dams than their have in human ones. Because of this, communities who live near or in former riverbeds greatly appreciate Bibarel populations, holding festivals in honor of these diligent Pokémon. Bibarel are sensitive to small changes in water currents, allowing them to sense flash floods before they occur. When they feel deluges approaching, they will quickly reinforce their dams to prevent the floods from overflowing over above them.","Kricketot are famous for the xylophone-like sound their hard antennae make when they clang together. By shaking their heads back and forth, they can make their antennae ring musically; this is how Kricketot communicate with others of their kind. Though their antennae are mostly stiff, Kricketot can adjust them slightly near the tips. By subtly curling and uncurling their antennae, Kricketot can alter the lengths of their exposed sections, thereby changing the pitches they make when they clang together. Altering the pitch and the rhythm of their clattering enables Kricketot to send complex messages to their peers. During the mating season, male Kricketot will compete with each other to compose beautiful melodies in order to seduce mates. As their mating season coincides with the beginning of autumn, many people associate Kricketot songs with the arrival of fall. Their short legs make them rather clumsy at walking; they often stumble about while traveling, causing their antennae to clang together inadvertently (but still pleasantly and melodiously). ","Kricketune have melodious cries that are easy on the ears. They are capable of composing melodies on the fly, often of a caliber rivaling that of professional musicians. Kricketune use songs to convey emotions, and are capable of making others around them feel similarly through their music. As they sing, they cross their knife-like arms across their chests. By allowing their cries to resonate within their bellies, they can produce a unique sound that is difficult to mimic with conventional instruments. Some villages hold Kricketune concerts in the autumn, where their wildly variable melodies are rated against one another. In battle, their musical capabilities manifest as the attack Bug Buzz. They use their sharp arms to slash foes that come too close, though they are also known to direct “symphonies” of Kricketot and Kricketune using their arms as well. When mating, suitors use size of their mustaches to display their virility. Then, pairs of Kricketune will compose duets they perform together to signify that they both have been “taken.”","Shinx generate electricity through the extension and contraction of their leg muscles, enabling them to charge up as they wander around fields and savannas. When threatened, they will light up their fur in bright flashes, temporarily blinding attackers and giving them time to flee. Shinx live in prides along with their evolutions. They rely primarily on Luxio to bring back food, though they will attempt to chase down smaller prey from time to time to hone their skills. Shinx are often seen playing around, chasing each other around in fields and transferring electricity to each other through small shocks. This play helps train their hunting and electrical skills. If Shinx wander too far from home, they will use electricity to make their fur glow in order to alert their families of their whereabouts. Though they can harness electricity to fire off attacks like Spark, they are rather inexperienced at doing so, often injuring themselves in the process. Because of this, their electrical use is mostly limited to emitting bright flashes and illuminating their fur.","Luxio live in small groups, with each group representing a pride. These groups do the bulk of the hunting for their families. By touching tails together, Luxio can generate more electricity within their bodies. This electricity can flow through their claws (which are sheathed when not in battle). Slashes from these electrified claws deliver strong enough currents to cause fainting in most foes. Luxio communicate with each other through electrical pulses transferred through their claws. They can utilized Electric-type attacks more effectively than Shinx, capable of launching moves like Discharge. Luxio groups spend much of their time away from their prides, prowling out in the wilderness for prey. When they take down sizable foes, they will bring them back to their prides to share among their families. Luxio are responsible for scouting on their journeys; should they spot anything dangerous approaching, they will immediately report the threats to the head Luxray of their prides. They will also aid in defending their families if necessary.","Luxray spend the day prowling around the vicinity of their territories. They have the ability to see through walls and other solid objects via x-ray vision; when their eyes gleam gold, they are using their vision to scan the area. Luxray use this skill to spot hidden threats and track down lost offspring. When their families are threatened, Luxray will attack back ferociously with the powerful Thunder Fang. One pride can hold as many as half a dozen Luxray, each with varying levels of dominance. The leader Luxray can be either of either gender, with their mates being second-in-command. The remaining Luxray are ranked based on their strength, challenging each other in battle to determine placement. This order determines who eats first at meals, leads the pack during prowls, and other aspects of life as well. Challenging leaders has the highest stakes of them all; losers are exiled from their prides, forced to start new ones on their own. A Luxray’s primary job in its pride is to care for offspring and defend the family. They will also occasionally aid in hunts to take down larger foes. ","Budew are found alongside clean water sources; they obtain most of their energy from the sun and water around them. Their buds remain closed throughout the winter as they endure the cold weather. Once the temperature rises in the spring, they will open their buds to scatter pollen. This pollen is in fact mildly toxic; it can trigger allergic reactions in many people and Pokémon, inducing harsh sneezing and runny noses. Budew rely primarily on their toxic pollen to discourage predators; they can also use Worry Seed to induce anxiety in foes via hallucinogenic plant seeds. Access to cleaner water seems to be correlated with more toxic pollen. Though they have historically been used as indicators of spring, recent studies have shown that Budew have begun opening their buds earlier and earlier in the season for the past few decades. Scientists believe that this trend is due to rising global temperatures, as Budew appear to open their buds in response to the climate rather than the time of year. Budew are keeping their buds open for longer periods of time because of the warmer weather, a nuisance for many people and Pokémon due to their pollen’s allergy-inducing effects.","Roserade are known for their grace and beauty, both in and out of battle. Their movements have been compared to that of dancers. Like Roselia, each of their two hands contains a different type of toxin, one that delivers a searing pain and another that leaves opponents essentially paralyzed. Both are fatal if not treated, however. The blooms on their arms emit a sweet, alluring scent that attracts prey towards them. However, they also hide whip-like vines lined with venomous thorns. Roserade use their scent to draw prey in, before unleashing their whips to attack, poison, and bind them. They can also jab their hands into foes to inject poison, thrusting with near-fatal force. In battle, Roserade dance around the field with their thorny vines out, whipping them around to constrict and poison opponents. Their aroma sweetens as their toxins become more potent, leading some to believe that the toxins are in fact what produce the scent. However, the toxin and the scent in fact do not affect each other; sweeter scents tend to come from healthier Roserade, who also tend to produce more virulent poison.","Cranidos can be revived from Skull Fossils, found primarily in sandstone. They dwelled in ancient tropical jungles about 100,000,000 years ago. Their skulls are as hard as steel; as they travel through forests, they simply headbutt trees in their way rather than going around them; fossilized trunks are plentiful in rock layers where Skull Fossils are found. Cranidos also tackle prey headfirst to take them down. They are omnivorous—when not hunting, they can often be found eating ferns and other low-growing plants. They also forage the Berries knocked out of the trees and shrubs they destroy while charging. Cranidos live in herds of 15 to 20 members, consisting both of Cranidos and their evolutions Rampardos. While not the smartest Pokémon these herds find strength in numbers, using their heads to fend off attackers like Aerodactyl from all directions. While able to attain high speeds, Cranidos require lots of room in order to accelerate properly. In cramped areas, they become vulnerable due to their inability to headbutt at full speed. Cranidos likely went extinct due to an extended glacial period that killed off most of the plants that made up over half of their diets.","Rampardos have skulls harder than industrial iron. They can pulverize even the sturdiest objects in single tackles. Their skulls are nearly a foot (0.3 m) thick, enabling them to withstand nearly any cranial blow. Consequently, however, this leaves little room for brain growth; as a result, these Pokémon are not very intelligent (their brains are even smaller that those of Cranidos). They will charge at anything they perceive to be threats. This occasionally even includes inanimate objects like boulders and trees; one modern incident involves a just-revived Rampardos pulverizing a skyscraper. Rampardos charge recklessly through forests when pursuing pursuing prey, leaving trails of fallen trees behind. Rampardos will ram heads together to compete for dominance until one gives; their thick skulls ensures that this process is a very arduous and time-consuming ritual. Archaeological evidence shows that some ancient cultures in fact unearthed Rampardos skulls and used them as helmets in combat. Though popular culture often portrays Rampardos as having gone extinct due to their low intellect, most scientists agree that they died out during an ice age that killed off much of the currently existing life at the time; a cooling climate destroyed most of the tropical plants that they relied upon for survival.","Scientists have successfully resurrected Shieldon from Armor Fossils found in hardened clay. These fossils are in fact remnants of their sturdy face plates; so far, no part of their softer torsos have been discovered in the fossil record. They lived approximately 100,000,000 years ago, making them concurrent with Lileep, Anorith, Cranidos, Tirtouga, and Tyrunt (some scientists also contest that Amaura also were alive during this time, though fossil record examinations have returned inconclusive). Their faces plates are very hard and are their main form of defense against attackers. They live in forests and woodlands, feeding on Berries and grasses in sunlit clearings. Their hard faces make them difficult targets for most predators, who generally avoid them due to their impervious armor (even their fossils are usually unscathed). However, smarter predators likely noted that they were very vulnerable from behind and exploited that fact. Scientists have recently postulated that Shieldon used leaves and bark to shine their faces, using the glare of sunlight to disorient foes. They likely went extinct during an ice age that killed off most of the plants that they required for food.","Bastiodon, though slow, are very defensively strong. They are virtually invulnerable to frontal attacks, as their steel-hard faces can withstand immense damage. Though their rears and sides are not nearly as strong, they still are relatively tough compared to other species. Bastiodon live in herds of 30 or so members. They raise their young until adulthood. When their herds are threatened, Bastiodon will line up side by side and barricade their offspring; these impregnable walls easily defend Shieldon from most predators. This defense, however, is notably weak to aerial attacks. Because their fossils are often found together, it is believed Bastiodon frequently clashed with Rampardos. Their facial bones are so hard and oddly shaped that scientists once thought they were sort of horn or spike until the first Bastiodon was successfully resurrected. Despite their imposing size, Bastiodon are docile creatures. They spend most of their time traveling with their herds in search of Berries and grasses. They are thought to have died out due to an ice age; the cooling climate wiped out many plants, and their sluggishness and herd reliance made remaining lone Bastiodon easy targets for predators.","Burmy are almost always seen covered in some kind of material, so few know what they look like bare (they resemble plain-looking, vertically-oriented larvae). They are very susceptible to the weather, so they will scramble to cover themselves if exposed. Their cloaks keep them insulated in cold winds; in warmer weather, they shed the outer layers of their cloaks to keep from overheating. Burmy seem to always find something to cover themselves in, no matter how barren their surroundings. In battle, their cloaks often shed off, forcing them to construct new ones out of nearby materials, using their silk to bind things goether. In forests, they will often be found in leaves and twigs. Near rivers, they will veil themselves in sand and pebbles. In cities, they scavenge refuse and metal scraps to make cloaks. Burmy have been recorded using other materials, as they are surprisingly resourceful when it comes to cloaking themselves; feathers, flower petals, and even discarded insect parts have all been used to make their covers.","Once Burmy evolve, their current cloaks fuse with their body and becomes permanent; unlike Burmy cloaks, Wormadam cloaks are never shed. In a rather extreme case of sexual dimorphism, only female Burmy evolve into Wormadam, never sprouting wings and instead remaining stationary for most of their lives. The variety of different cloaks Burmy use also transfers over to Wormadam. Like Burmy, most Wormadam are covered in either leaves and other plant materials, sand and gravel, or trash and metal scraps. However, these are hardly the only types of coverings found within the species. A Wormadam’s covering affects what attacks it can use in battle. Plant Cloak Wormadam can use leaves to execute Razor Leaf; Sandy Cloak Wormadam can utilize pebbles in Rock Blast; Steel Cloak Wormadam can manipulate metal scraps to use Mirror Shot. As Burmy alter the thickness of their cloaks to regulate their temperatures, Wormadam that evolve on cold days also tend to have thicker cloaks.","While female Burmy fuse their cloaks and become Wormadam, male ones shed their covers, grow wings, and evolve into Mothim. Mothim are nocturnal Pokémon, flitting about forests in search of floral honey. They have no stationary nests and are constantly on the move in search of food. Mothim rest wherever there is shelter, but do not return twice to the same place. Though their primary source of nutrition is honey, they are not well-adapted to obtain it themselves. Instead, they search for Combee hives around forests, sneakily stealing honey from them. This task is more difficult than it sounds, considering that Combee hives are actually made up of watchful Combee. It is thought that Mothim cloak themselves in a scent similar to that of Combee to avoid detection as they fill up on honey. Because they are active at night, when Combee tend to rely more on smell than sight to detect intruders, they can generally slip in unnoticed. This isn’t a guarantee, however, and it isn’t uncommon to see unlucky Mothim being attacked by huge swarms of Combee at night.","Combee are born as group of 3, with the lower heads being dominant. They dedicate their entire lives to pleasing their queen Vespiquen. Combee spend the entire day flitting from flower to flower, collecting nectar. They turns this nectar into honey and take it back to Vespiquen. Combee eat just enough to survive, giving all of the surplus to their queens; each head has a slightly different nectar preference. They are diurnal; at night, Combee colonies rest by stacking their bodies together to form hives protecting the queen. Their hexagonal bodies allow no space for intruders to slip through when they stack together. About a third of the Combee in a hive will be awake at any given time, keeping watch over their colony. Combee will attack any potential threats, not hesitating to give their lives to protect their queens. Combee are entirely subservient to their queens’ orders; should the queens go missing, their colonies will fly about worriedly in search of them, not eating or resting until they are found. Female Combee can be distinguished by a red mark on their main heads; only 1 in 8 Combee are female.","Vespiquen are rarely seen in the wild, as they are almost constantly cloaked by walls of very protective Combee. Though capable of making honey, they rarely do so, relying on their Combee to bring back food for them. The six-celled undersides of their abdomens serve as nests for Combee grubs, which they (or rather, their workers) will protect at all costs. Conversely, the grubs will also protect their mothers with their lives. Much of the honey Vespiquen colonies collect goes towards feeding these offspring. There is only one Vespiquen in a hive; should another female Combee evolve, it will immediately be exiled by the reigning queen to form a new colony. The primary job of a Vespiquen is to birth and protect new Combee. When their colonies falter, Vespiquen can produce pheromones to command their grubs to do their bidding; they can use Attack Order to wear down foes, Defend Order to strengthen their own defenses, or Heal Order to replenish energy. Individuals with stronger pheromones can command a larger number of grubs more effectively. Vespiquen will repay outsiders who help defend their hives from attackers graciously with generous amounts of honey. They will viciously attack those who steal honey, however.","Pachirisu are often found scurrying about forests, climbing up and down trees. They also sometimes makes their home in city parks and even power plants. Their fur crackles with electricity, which is particularly concentrated in their bushy tails. Their cheek pouches are responsible for their electricity, producing and distributing charge throughout their bodies. They are often seen rubbing cheek pouches together in an attempt to share their stored electricity. When endangered, they can fire bolts of electricity from their tails. Pachirisu eat nuts and Berries. They have a unique way of ​protecting their collected food; they save the fur they shed throughout the day, fashioning it into electrified furballs. When they stash food in tree hollows or the eaves of houses, they also throw in some of these puffs. If intruders attempt to steal food and touch a furball, they will instead get a nasty shock. When Pachirisu sleep, they curl their tails around to use as pillows. They are agile Pokémon that can of maneuver through tree branches with ease.","Buizel live in fast-moving rivers. The collars around their necks are actually adjustable, air-filled flotation sacs. When inflated, they let Buizel rest with their heads above water, allowing them to sleep without fear of drowning (Buizel can hold their breaths for long periods of time, but must still surface to breathe). They also inflate their sacs to keep their heads afloat as they scan for prey. When Buizel dive, they deflate their sacs so they won’t rise back to the surface. They swim by spinning their two tails around like propellers. This method enables them to swim very quickly and cut through weeds that would normally slow them down. Their are primarily piscine, though they will also feed on bivalves as well. Young Buizel are very playful; they can  often seen splashing together in the water. They outgrow this behavior as they age, but still remain very friendly. On land, though not as agile as they are in the water, Buizel are still relatively fast; they will sometimes venture onto shore should their sacs become damaged. They wrap their tails around reeds when sleeping to stay anchored.","Floatzel have highly-developed flotation sacs, letting them carry more than twice their body weight while still remaining above the water’s surface. They are often seen lounging lazily down rivers, floating on their backs. Floatzel are very swift, capable of using speed-based moves like Aqua Jet in battle. They deflate their flotation sacs to dive and use their twin tails to propel themselves. Scientists believe that Floatzel were once terrestrial Pokémon that adapted to aquatic life in order to catch underwater prey. This theory is supported by the fact that they can move around perfectly well on land, though they prefer to be in the water. Floatzel are often found around fishing ports, where they are seen as both nuisances and aids. On one hand, they sometimes snatch prey straight from the hooks of anglers. On the other, they can be helpful Pokémon, known to rescue drowning people and Pokémon by inflating their raft-like flotation sacs and carrying them to shore on their backs.  Generally, most anglers leave Floatzel alone because of this.","When Cherubi are born, they initially have two equally-sized heads. However, as they grow, the two heads compete for dominance, as they cannot photosynthesize enough nutrients to support them both. Eventually, one wins out, and the other withers away into a vestigial ball. The remaining heads then use their siblings to supplement their growth; the smaller heads are sweet and packed with nutrients, making them very popular treats for avian Pokémon like Starly. Though Cherubi can survive without their second heads, their growth will be severely stunted without the extra nutrients; thus, they protect these heads very fiercely, dashing away from would-be predators with surprising speed. If they don’t get enough sunlight, their vivid red coloration will dull, though it will intensify as they approach evolution. Once Cherubi have drained all of the nutrients they can from their second heads, they will bud and the heads will wither away; Cherubi are ready for evolution at this time. They are often seen on tree branches on warm, sunny days. They are attracted to Combee honey, but consuming too much can make them ill.","When in their standard forms, it is quite easy to completely miss Cherrim while examining the treetops. In the Overcast Form, Cherrim are quiet and immobile, waiting unassumingly in the shade. Once hit by beams of sunlight, however, they bloom into the Sunshine Form. In this form, Cherrim are very active and excitable, basking fully in the sun’s rays by facing all of their petals towards it. They uses this precious time under the sun to photosynthesize as much energy as they can, since they are unable to do so in its other form. Cherrim also becomes stronger under the sunlight thanks to this extra energy. They can take down foes much larger than themselves by using powerful attacks like Solar Beam during this time. They can store large amounts of sugars in their bodies, which they use to endure long periods in the Overcast Form. In the Sunshine Form, they appear eternally joyful, while in Overcast Form they seem constantly gloomy. Once the sunlight wanes, Cherrim close their petals and return to the Overcast Form, patiently awaiting for the sun to return. Their petals are deceptively tough, protecting them from pecking bird Pokémon.","Shellos are unique in that they and Gastrodon have two variants, a pink West Sea form and a blue East Sea form. Scientists believe that they are currently undergoing allopatric speciation, a process in which geographic isolation causes two populations to evolve into separate species. It is theorized that the rise of Mt. Coronet in Sinnoh divided Shellos into two sides, each of which then began adapting to their new habitats while being cut off from those on the other side of the peak. Research shows that Shellos in more fertile waters are more vibrant in color; this suggests that their colorations may be influenced by diet, climate, or water temperature. It is theorized that pink West Sea Shellos are associated with warmer waters, and blue East Sea Shellos are associated with cooler waters. Though the two variants can still currently breed as one species, scientists believe that this may not be case in the future, when the two forms may not even recognize each other as related. Shellos can extend their necks very far to reach algae and plankton in difficult places. When squeezed, they will ooze a slippery purple fluid analogous to mammalian sweat. This substance makes it difficult for predators to grasp them so they can flee. They can similarly exude a sticky, but harmless purple goo to slow attackers. Shellos also have remarkable regenerative qualities, and researchers are currently studying their cellular properties in order to discover the biological mechanism behind this.","Gastrodon exhibit evidence of allopatric speciation, with the rise of Mt. Coronet separating them into the pink West Sea and blue East Sea forms. The two are still considered the same species, as they will naturally breed in the rare chance that they meet, but it is believed that they will one day become distinct enough that they will no longer recognize each other. Scientists believe that Gastrodon once had shells like their relatives Cloyster based on DNA evidence. They likely lost their shells to adapt to habitats where the needed calcium was scarce, though they still maintain a thin but hard plate vestigial beneath their skin. Like Shellos, Gastrodon ooze a slick purple fluid when hurt to make themselves slippery. This substance is also very bitter and renders their meat nearly inedible. They have superb regenerative skills and can grow back torn-off parts of their bodies. They are pliable because they lack skeletal systems, letting them into squeeze into tight spaces. Gastrodon can also venture terrestrially for short periods of time, especially in areas of calm waves. While some researchers are searching for new Gastrodon variants, others are experimenting to see if their coloration is altered if they are raised in a different environment.","Ambipom live high up in the treetops in large colonies. Upon evolution, their single tails split in two. Like Aipom, their hands have become vestigial, as they exclusively use their tails for virtually all tasks. Ambipom eat fruits and nuts that grow within the trees they live in. They use their tails to deftly peel fruit and shuck nuts; rinds and shells often litter the ground below trees where Ambipom colonies dwell. They also use their tails to swing from branch to branch, and are capable of suspending themselves from branches using their tails as they eat or play. They can sometimes be seen “holding hands” as they link their tails together in rings. This gesture is a sign of peace and friendship amongst a colony. They communicate by holding tails with each other and making different gestures with them. In battle, Ambipom nimbly manipulate their two tails to attack foes with moves like Double Hit; many opponents find it very difficult to dodge both of their consecutive attacks. Ambipom colonies often get into territorial disputes with Passimian troops, with who they are evenly matched. To display pleasure, Ambipom will clap their tails together happily. They will express affection by clasping their tails tightly around others in a \"hug.\"","Drifloon float aimlessly in small groups, flying wherever the wind blows. They are more common in humid weather. They are believed to converse by expanding and deflating their air-filled bodies. They will explode as a last-resort effort to defend their groups; the shriek-like sound of a deflating Drifloon is said to be its escaping soul. Though considered cute by some, Drifloon also have quite a few dark legends surrounding them. In some regions, they are seen as “signposts for wandering spirits;” Drifloon are thought to be always be floating towards the world of the dead, so spirits lost on earth can follow them to the underworld. Another legend states that Drifloon will entice children into grasping their hands, pretending to be balloons. Some believe that Drifloon are filled with the souls of those they have led away into the unknown, growing larger with each spirit. They will then try to pull them to the underworld. Their lightness is said to be the only thing preventing their success, as they often end up being tugged around by the kids instead; it is also said that they dislike heavy children. In the past, cases of missing children were often blamed on wild Drifloon.","Drifblim have little control of their flight, as they rely entirely on winds to take them about. This makes their flight very erratic and unpredictable. However, Drifblim can inflate and deflate their bodies with gas to adjust their altitudes, and in that manner subtly alter the way they fly. Drifblim float in large groups across clear skies; during the daytime, they are often drowsy and lethargic, aloof to the weather and environment around them. They become more active at dusk, however. Mysteriously, entire groups of Drifblim seem to simply disappear when observed; no one knows where they go or how they vanish so suddenly, though according to folklore they are in fact traveling across the boundary to the spirit realm. Though capable of carrying others, their lackluster aerial control makes them poor choices for flying around. Some say that riding a Drifblim on the winds at dusk will result in a one-way trip to the afterlife. Famously, one researcher who rode his Driflbim to track its path never returned from the journey. Drifblim can summon mysterious attacks like Ominous Wind to weaken foes; they appear to be a docile species in the wild, however. No one knows how wild Drifblim feed, due to their tendencies to disappear suddenly, though legend has it that their bodies are in fact filled with the souls of those they have taken away, and that deflating Drifblim will search for new victims in order to reinflate themselves.","Buneary can be found in forests and on icy mountains. They feed on grasses, flowers, and other low-growing plants. Their ears are very sensitive, and serve as their main method of detecting predators. One can tell how Buneary are feeling based on the position of their ears; if both are perked up, they are on guard and alert. If they both are withdrawn, on the other hand, they are scared and nervous. Buneary defend themselves using their long ears. They rolls them up and then uncoil them quickly to “punch” attackers, hitting with enough force to shatter boulders. Needless to say, humans who have angered Buneary have described their thrusts as “excruciatingly painful;” their strikes have been recorded to leave bruises, welts, and even broken bones. Though docile, these Pokémon are also very timid and may strike out of fear when startled. Buneary can strike the ground beneath them with their ears to propel themselves surprisingly high, allowing them to launch aerial attacks.  When cold, these Pokémon tuck their heads into their fur to stay warm.","Like Buneary, Lopunny are very timid and are quick to sprint off at the first sign of danger. They run with high, graceful jumps that make it difficult for predators catch them while in motion. Their fluffy fur is shed twice a year, once in the summer and once in the winter. While their summer coats are light and airy, their winter coats are warm, soft, and fluffy; this makes them very valuable in the fashion industry for clothing, particularly for use in mufflers and hats. If cornered, Lopunny will become very skittish, cloaking themselves with their large ears to hide. Should foes continue to hound them, however, they will be met with nasty flurries of kicks to head. Their legs are very strong, thanks to their frequent jumping. This makes their kicks very powerful, much to the surprise of most foes. In their spare time, Lopunny can often be found grooming and cleaning the delicate fur on their ears. One of the few situations in which these Pokémon will become hostile is if their clean fur is sullied, causing them to lash out aggressively using their strong legs as well as attacks like Return.","Mismagius can occasionally be seen floating around dark forests in the dead of night. Their cries sound like ominous chanting. Those who hear their cries may experience symptoms like hallucinations and headaches. It is said that their chants can be cast as curses or blessings on others, depending on how they are feeling.  Those under their spells will remain entranced until the Mismagius that cast the spells are fainted, or until they decide to break the hexes on their own. Though feared in the past for their curses, desperate souls also sought out Mismagius for their rumored abilities to bless love, health, and fortune. It is said that somewhere deep in a mysterious forest, a trio of Mismagius that can predict anyone’s fate dwells. Their mysterious powers have led people in older times to fear them as demons or witches. Since Mismagius are repelled by light and fire, villagers kept burning stakes in the centers of their town to keep them away. In modern times, city lights generally keep Mismagius out of urban areas, and most prefer to stay away from humans anyways.","Though Honchkrow have large wings that let them fly long distances, they rarely leave their nests. They instead “hire” Murkrow henchmen to do their biddings, paying them with shiny objects (which Murkrow hoard compulsively) and food. Their Murkrow cronies collect food and valuables to bring back. Honchkrow will then dole out just enough pay their henchmen and take the rest for themselves. As they wait for their Murkrow to return, Honchkrow enjoy preening their feathers. When necessary, they can emit a distinctive cry to summon all of their Murkrow to them; over a 100 may respond to a single call. Some call them “Summoners of the Night” because of this. Though Murkrow cronies are rewarded generously, they are also punished mercilessly for errors; Honchkrow will take flight to hunt down disappointments in order to enforce total loyalty from their henchmen. They are extremely territorial, leaving their nests is to defend their domains from other Honchkrow in duels to the death. The Murkrow of losing sides are then subject to the winning Honchrow’s whims. Honchkrow will only ever dirty their feathers in order to deal the finishing blow on particularly troublesome enemies.","Glameow can be fickle Pokémon; despite this, they are very popular pets found in many homes. In fact, some find their difficulty appealing, likening it to the attitudes of young children. It is easy to read a Glameow’s mood; when happy, it will purr contently and twirl its tail around like a ribbon. When unhappy, though, it will unsheathe its claws and dig them into its trainer’s nose. Glameow will become displeased when hungry, thirsty, tired, too warm or cold, or just generally uncomfortable. Thus, they can be difficult Pokémon to keep content much of the time, and their trainers may often find themselves dedicating large portions of their schedules to pleasing their Glameow. Recently, it was discovered that their glares appear to have a mildly hypnotic effect, compelling those that they meet eyes with to do as they please. It is likely that this ability plays a part in their continued popularity as pets. Glameow can be spiteful creatures, remembering those who displease them with great clarity and exacting revenge at much later dates.","For lack of a better term, Purugly are what would normally referred to as “bullies.” They don’t build their own nests, but instead wander around in search of those of others to take over. They will unflinchingly barge into homes that aren’t theirs and assess them; if they find them sufficiently comfortable, they will seize them over and kick the owners out. If they are unsatisfactory, rather than simply leaving, Purugly will make sure to destroy the nests as well. They are even known to break into human homes to sleep in bedrooms, ransacking the houses once rested. When confronted, Purugly will stare down their foes aggressively. They staunchly refuse to be the first to break eye contact and will continue to glare until their foes look away. To appear more intimidating and brawny, they will constrict their forked tails around their bodies, squeezing in their flabby stomachs. They will aggressively attack anything bothering them, with “bothering” defined as “being within eyesight.” Despite their unsavory natures, some people find Purugly to be desirable, if difficult, pets.","Chingling can be found hopping around on the ground or in the treetops. They have orbs in the backs of their mouths that they can use to produce a ringing sound. As they move about, the orbs collide with the sides of their mouths, creating the distinctive, high-pitched ring recognized as their cries. Due to their body structure, they can resonate sound for long periods of time; once they begin crying, they will continue ringing for over fifteen minutes. By altering the shape of their mouths, Chingling can change the pitch of their cries. The sound can be melodious and pleasing when they are happy, but earsplittingly sharp if they feel threatened. In battle, Chingling cry loudly at very high frequencies to deafen foes. They can reach ultrasonic pitches that the human ear cannot detect. Chingling communicate through different volumes and pitches of their cries. The sound of many Chingling crying at once in a large squabble is said to be one of the most discordant sounds known to man.","Stunky are famous for being able to spray a noxious liquid from their rear ends. The smell is so horrid that Pokémon (and people) will refuse to go near anyone or anything that has been sprayed. In the past, people used Stunky fluids in place of modern Repels to keep wild Pokémon away, at the cost of smelling horrendous until the smell wore off. Once sprayed, it can take a full 24 hours for the stench to dissipate; the odor can be detected from up to 1.25 miles (2 kilometers) away. Stunky spray their fluid only as a defense mechanism; they can only shoot about a half-dozen times before having to recharge their scent glands, a process that can take up to a week. To make up for this, they will first give off a variety of warning signals to scare foes off without shooting; they will hiss, stamp their feet, and then finally raise their tails before spraying. Stunky will aim for the face, and can spray from up to 16 feet (5 meters) away. After being doused once, most foes learn to recognize the warnings and flee before getting doused. Oddly, Stunky seem to be unharmed by Combee swarms, walking right through them unfazed when searching for Honey.","Unlike their pre-evolutions, Skuntank have scent glands on the tips of their tails rather than the bases. This enables them to aim at foes much better, since they can actually see where they are shooting. Skuntank can spray their noxious fluids from a distance of over 160 feet (50 meters). Unlike Stunky, however, the smell doesn’t wear off after a day or so; instead, it only worsens the longer the liquid is allowed to fester on it target. The exact odor varies based on the Skuntank's diet. In older times, crushed Tamato Berries were the most popular remedy for Skuntank stench; while effective, the berries are also extraordinarily spicy and irritating to the skin and eyes. Modern Poké Marts usually carry Skuntank deodorant in areas where the Pokémon are found. As a side effect of their forward-oriented tails, Skuntank cannot see upwards very well, and are thus very susceptible to aerial attacks. The fluid produced by their scent glands is highly flammable; Skuntank can ignite the spurts of liquid that they spray in order to use the move Flamethrower in battle, much to the surprise of many opponents. Skuntank dig their nests into flat ground, marking the surrounding area to warn intruders of their presence.","Bronzor are ancient Pokémon believed to have been around since man first formed a civilization. Archaeologists have discovered bronze tools shaped like Bronzor buried in ancient Sinnohian tombs; no one is quite sure what the connection is, but some believe that ancient societies thought that Bronzor had some kind of mystical power and tried to replicate it through their implements. The herb-shaped pattern on their backs, it was said, is what held their power. Researchers speculate that the plant-like design indicate that Bronzor had some connection with harvests and fertility. Others believe that in the past, they reflected like mirrors, their mysterious powers letting onlookers gaze into the past. It is said that a shined Bronzor will always reflect the truth, though the Pokémon dislike being polished. Bafflingly, when scientists attempted to take an X-ray of a Bronzor to examine its body structure, the image came out blank. Alternative research attempting to solve the many mysteries surrounding them has also turned up inconclusive. In popular culture, many believe that Bronzor cannot be harmed by fire. This is untrue, though some Bronzor do seem to resist flames somewhat.","The first Bronzong was discovered entirely accidentally, found dormant during the construction of a high-rise building. It was buried deep beneath the surface, along with various other ancient artifacts (including Bronzor-shaped implements). Upon further examination, scientists concluded that it had been “asleep” for about 2,000 years. Historians believe that Bronzong were once revered as “bringers of plentiful harvests;” ancient civilizations thought that by ringing their gong-like bells, Bronzong could open portals to other dimensions and summon rain clouds. People would ​leave out offerings and complete ritualistic dances in hopes of appeasing these Pokémon during poor weather. In battle, Bronzong appear to be able to utilize this ability through the move Rain Dance. Like Bronzor, some Bronzong appear to demonstrate an odd resistance to fire. Bronzong can undergo long periods of dormancy. When in this state, their eyes turn white, they stop floating, and they become immobile. Scientists believe can remain like this essentially indefinitely.","Bonsly thrive in arid environments, as their bodies cannot tolerate much moisture. However, they stand out starkly against dull backgrounds, so they tend to camouflage with trees in wooded areas (albeit away from streams). They sometimes wander into parks for similar reasons; one may occasionally see Bonsly fleeing from gardens when sprinkler systems turn on. Bonsly are often found “crying;” in fact, they are not upset, but rather regulating their moisture levels by excreting excess fluids out of their eyes. They in fact exude two types of fluids this way. The first is salty and similar in composition to human sweat. The other is much more astringent, and is used as a bittering agent in some cuisines. The more humid their surroundings, the more they will weep. In battle, this skill also goads enemies into letting their guards down. Bonsly are relatively skilled at mimicking trees, capable of remaining still for long periods of time. They dig small holes in the ground and bury themselves halfway, posing as small saplings. Like Sudowoodo, however, attempting to water them will cause them to uproot and scamper away. When threatened, Bonsly will try to flee, but may throw themselves at foes as a last resort. Due to their weight, this can be a very painful maneuver. The dull luster of their green orbs increases as they dry out, acting as a sign of their moisture level.","Mime Jr. can be found wandering through crowded streets in urban areas. They are notable for relying heavily on humans, performing in front of audiences in exchange for food. They are can be mimics, potentially able to perfect copying the facial expressions and body movements of people and Pokémon. By doing so, they are also able to gain insight into their emotions; Mime Jr. may take advantage of this by focusing on more benevolent, compassionate spirits during their performances in hopes of earning more food. However, they make mistakes often, which will break the illusion. If attacked, they will mimic foes to confuse them, fleeing before they have a chance to react. If attackers are unfazed by their displays, they can also erect invisible barriers like their evolutions to keep them away. In battle, their ability to imitate opponents allows them to use moves like Mimic and Copycat against foes. One may occasionally find Mime Jr. scavenging through dumpsters in search of food; these Pokémon are known to raid trash bins when they fail to earn enough through performing. When Mime Jr. successfully enrapture a crowd through skilled mimicking, they may become so elated that they forget they were putting on an act to begin with, and continuing mimicking their subjects long after the end of their performances. In the Galar region, it is common to see Mime Jr. serving as apprentices and learning from veteran Mr. Rime.","Happiny have stretchy, rubber-like belly pouches that can hold various objects within them, such as spare food. They are most commonly found, however, with white, smooth, oval-shaped rocks in their pouches; they love round, white objects in general, and will carry them around in their pouches in imitation of their evolutions. The more the stones resemble eggs, the more valuable they are to them. Pebbles perfectly shaped and colored like eggs are known as Oval Stones; these are necessary to facilitate their evolutions into Chansey. They will hoard multiple of such objects if given the opportunity, sometimes becoming so heavy that they can no longer move. Taking a stone from a Happiny will upset it greatly and cause it to throw a tantrum, however--even if the weight of the stone is preventing it from walking properly. Happiny are very conscious about the curls of hair on their heads and will visit bodies of water to clean and adjust them as needed. Despite their sizes, Happiny are deceptively strong, capable of lifting heavy objects much larger than themselves. They have a quirky tendency to wander right between the feet of larger people and Pokémon, causing them to stumble. When Happiny make new friends, they will give them their stones as signs of trust; refusing the stones will greatly anger them, as doing so is a sign of disrespect to Happiny.","Chatot are very talented in mimicking the sounds of others. Their tongues are structurally similar to those of humans, enabling them to repeat nearly any word that they hear. They can also copy the cries of other Pokémon. Chatot use this ability to avoid predators and fool prey; by mimicking their targets, they can pretend to be members of the same species and thus avoid detection. Chatot have great memories and can remember any sound they hear. They add these noises to their repertoires, which they can pull out of to construct and sing patchwork melodies. They swing their tails back and forth like metronomes keep time. If many Chatot gather together, they will learn and repeat whatever the first one says until they all are saying the same thing. In battle, they can use Chatter to both deafen and confuse foes. These intelligent Pokémon can learn by observation and experience; for example, they may scare foes away by copying the cries of their predators, or draw prey closer by producing corresponding mating calls.","Spiritomb are mysterious Pokémon, with their true origins shrouded in mystery. Legend has it that the first Spiritomb was created 500 years ago when 108 wicked spirits were all trapped together in an artifact known as the Odd Keystone, punished by a mysterious spell for their misdeeds in the world. The Odd Keystone can be seen at the bases of their bodies, with their “faces” rushing out of fissures on their sides. The keystones are said to prevent any of the spirits from causing misfortune ever again; should they ever be released, they would wreak havoc on the world and its inhabitants. While Spiritomb can extend their faces short distances from their keystones, they ultimately are tethered to them wherever they go. This doesn’t stop them, however, from taking out their anger at being imprisoned on anything near them. The circular areas around their keystones are almost always devoid of any life whatsoever. They cannot move on their own, but some say they can persuade evil-hearted spirits who approach to transport their stones for them.","Gible are a hardy species, found in warm, remote areas. Long ago, they used to dwell in tropical areas, but they eventually adapted to farther (though still sweltering) latitudes. They are now found in caverns heated by geothermal activity and sun-baked badlands with little rainfall. Gible builds nests by digging small holes horizontally into the sides of cave walls. They wait for prey to pass by before instinctually pouncing onto and then biting them with their powerful jaws. Their jaws are spectacularly strong for their sizes; as a consequence of this, however, they will sometimes injure themselves or chip their teeth from the sheer force of their own biting. These injuries rarely bother them, as they have a high threshold for pain. Though solitary, Gible are not territorial; they play-fight with other Gible and will huddle together in cold weather to stay warm. Their dorsal fins are strong enough to support adult men. When rubbed one way, their skin feels as smooth as rubber, but when rubbed the other way, it feels as rough as sandpaper. They are not very nimble, as their stubby limbs make them rather clumsy when walking; this is likely why they are ambush predators.","Gabite are highly territorial, viciously defending their domains against intruders. Unlike Gible, Gabite are very swift, allowing them to actually chase prey instead of waiting for their approach. They enjoy collecting sparkly items, particularly gemstones. They will dig into cave walls in search of jewels (and Carbink), hoarding them in large piles in their nests. Gabite nests are constantly targeted by thieves due to the immense value of the jewels they hold. However, their hostility make infiltrating their nests a very difficult task. They will remain motionless for hours at a time keeping an eye on their hoards. Research shows that only Sableye, thanks to their stealthiness, can successfully and consistently sneak in and out of Gabite nests to snatch and eat gems; the victimized Gabite will give ferocious and relentless chase to them if spotted, however. Gabite scales are thought to have medicinal properties. Some people believe that grinding the scales and then consuming the resulting powder will cure any illness. Though illegal to sell, the difficulty of obtaining these scales make them very valuable on the black market in many regions. Gabite shed their scales along with their skins periodically as they grow, but these shed scales are regarded as lower quality in traditional medicine than \"fresh\" ones.","Garchomp are blisteringly fast; as they run,  their “wings” (the fins on their forearms) can create blades of wind strong enough to slice down trees. Though they may not seem like it, they are also capable of flight. When they fold in their limbs and extend their wings, Garchomp both look and travel like jet planes, capable of reaching sonic speed. Their scales are fine and all face the same direction. In flight, the scales are oriented in such a way that they reduce drag. When rubbed in the opposite direction, on the other hand, their skin is rough enough to leave minor cuts. Garchomp are very aggressive and territorial, not hesitating to attack intruders with the powerful Dragon Claw. Travelers that must pass through their territory should bring along a few Yache Berries as a precautionary measure; Garchomp can be calmed by the Berries for short periods of time, possibly long enough for trainers to escape unharmed. Their head growths help them detect heat signatures to hunt down distant prey; they are known to dive into flocks of bird Pokémon and swallow them whole. In remote badlands, Garchomp are even reported to even engage in midair battles with Salamence over prey.","Unlike Snorlax, Munchlax are very active Pokémon. They spend almost all of their time walking or running (or more accurately, waddling) around in search of food. They eat their own body weight in food every day, and they rarely chew food before swallowing. They hide leftovers in their fur to save for later, but often forget about them, leaving the morsels to rot on their bodies. Consequently, wild Munchlax frequently smell of decomposing refuse. They will still gladly consume these spoiled items, however, as they can eat just about anything without experiencing any ill effects thanks to their robust stomachs. In fact, a Munchlax sharing its possibly-rotten stored food with someone is a sure sign of trust. Despite how much they eat, Munchlax rarely are ever full; they constantly are looking for more to eat. Occasionally, they can be found wandering around houses; they will squeeze their way through small openings or windows to eat food left out for pets. Some people have even reported Munchlax raiding pantries, cabinets, and refrigerators in search of food, eating everything they can find in the process. Munchlax hate confrontation and will flee at the first sign of danger, though, so they are thankfully easy to scare off.","Riolu can detect a mystical energy known as “aura,” best described as the “essence” of all living things. Everything alive emanates aura; a being’s vitality determines the size of its aura, while its character determines its color and shape. Riolu can “read” the auras of beings around them to determine their emotions; the more passionate the feelings, the more easily they be sensed. They can detect strong feelings like joy and rage most easily. Since aura can travel in waves and pulses, Riolu can send long-distance messages to others of their kind via their aura without attracting attention from predators, varying their colors and shapes to do so. When endangered, they will intensify their auras to alert their friends around them with a “pulse.” Though small, Riolu are also very resilient; they have been recorded to be able to cross three mountains and two canyons in a single night. They are playful and energetic Pokémon, often found leaping around boulders or over ravines to train their agility. Riolu are also very loyal to their trainers, willing to defend them no matter how dangerous the situation. They will use their aura sensing to determine the strength of approaching foes and pick their fights accordingly.","Lucario have stronger aura abilities than Riolu. They can read the auras of foes to predict their thoughts and movements. Skilled Lucario can analyze auras and emotions from beings over half a mile (one kilometer) away. They can also harness aura into corporeal attacks like Aura Sphere, with enough strength to blast through stone. Few foes can evade Lucario, as their aura-reading abilities enable them to pinpoint even the most well-hidden foes in the area. When they harness aura, the four black appendages on their heads will rise in the air, supported by their powers. Due to their ability to read the thoughts of others, Lucario are essentially able to understand human speech; they can also manipulate their aura to respond to people. Lucario are very loyal Pokémon; they will give their lives to defend their trainers. They spend much of their time training alone, hiding away in mountains to avoid distractions, as distressed auras from others can also stress them out as well. They have strong senses of justice and will actively work to defeat foes whose auras read as “evil-hearted.” Oddly, these Pokémon seem to have an affinity for chocolate, despite the food’s scarcity in the wild.","Hippopotas tend to live and travel in colonies normally numbering around ten or so members. They live in arid deserts, as they dislike water and cannot tolerate much of it in their systems. They have a curious method of traveling, in that they do not walk on the sand like most Pokémon, but rather through it. They wade through sand with most of their bodies submerged, only leaving their eyes poking above the surface. They can travel in this manner just as efficiently as other Pokémon would walking. When Hippopotas wade through sand, they walk with their mouths open and their nostrils shut, surfacing every so often to breathe. They essentially filter-feed this way, catching prey hiding in the sand and then expelling the grains out from their pores; because of this, they are constantly cloaked in veils of swirling sand. The cloaks help keep germs away and also make it more difficult for predators to spot them. It is easy to tell male and female Hippopotas apart; while males have tan-colored snouts, females have darker brown-colored ones; additionally, their patch coloration is also inverted. These Pokémon are diurnal, spending nights burrowed in the still-warm desert sand.","Hippowdon are very ill-tempered Pokémon, prone to attacking anything that angers them on sight. They can open their jaws to a width of nearly 7 feet (2 meters) and bite down with enough force to crush cars. They will give only one warning sign before attacking, opening their mouths wide to display their power before rushing at foes to attack. Like Hippopotas, they are normally found with their torsos submerged in sand. As they sit, they store sand in their bodies through the large pores on their backs. When angered, Hippowdon can expel these grains to create powerful sand tornadoes. They are often seen with sand spilling out of their pores, having stored too much while submerged. As they walk, they leave trails of sand behind in their wakes. Despite their poor tempers, Hippowdon are sometimes seen dwelling in close proximity with each other; these pods are to be segregated by gender, only coming together to mate. Pods do not seem to develop close bonds, however, and individuals tend to act on their own during day-to-day activities. Curiously, these ferocious creatures have a mutualistic relationship with tiny Dwebble; Dwebble help dislodge stones that get stuck in the pores of Hippowdon, and then can use the stones to make their shells. For this reason, Hippowdon are often protective of local Dwebble populations.","Skorupi are found primarily in arid deserts, though some populations have been able to survive along the shores of marshes. They bury themselves in sand or mud and patiently wait for prey to wander by. Then, they lash out and grasps their victims with the pincers on their tails before stabbing them with their needle-like stingers to inject an immobilizing poison. They can go up to a year without food and can similarly survive for long periods of time without water. Skorupi that dwell in wetter environments can sometimes be found perched on stones bathed in direct sunlight, drying and warming their bodies. In deserts, they may burrow into the sand to stay cool during the sweltering daytime. It was recently discovered that Skorupi glow a striking electric blue when exposed to ultraviolet light. What purpose this serves is as of yet unknown, but some speculate that it may have to do with being able to detect others of their kind in the darkness; it is possible that Skorupi can see ultraviolet light, though further research must be done to confirm this speculation.","Drapion are aggressively territorial by nature, relentlessly attacking anyone that encroaches on their land. This has given them rather poor reputations as \"Sand Demons,\" as they are known for attacking desert travelers seemingly out of nowhere. In the past, desert caravans feared Drapion far more than they did thieves, keeping Cornn Berries on hand under the belief that they would keep them at bay. It was thought that their scent deterred Drapion and other poisonous creatures found in the desert. Drapion use their tough pincers to tear apart foes; they are powerful enough to turn cars into piles of scrap metal. In addition to their strength, their claws can also inject a fatal venom that leaves victims in excruciating pain before they succumb to it. Their sturdy bodies are a source of pride among the species; while their venom is very powerful, they prefer to defeat foes using only brute force to demonstrate their power. Their bodies are encased in durable carapaces that protect them from attacks. Drapion can rotate their heads 180°, allowing them to see virtually everything around them. Despite their strength, however, in areas where they are found together, Drapion will usually acquiesce to Hippowdon in territorial disputes.","Croagunk dwell in damp, dark areas away from direct sunlight. They are aloof Pokémon, preferring to ignore others as much as possible and only engaging in combat when their lives are in peril. When fighting, however, they are not above using “dirty tactics” to keep themselves alive; they are known for making liberal use of “cheap shots” in battle. By expanding and deflating the poison sacs on their cheeks, they can emit an unsettling blubbering sound that often causes foes to flinch. They take advantage of these moments to jab enemies with their poisonous fingers, which are toxic enough to kill smaller Pokémon upon contact. Croagunk can also spray poison straight out of their fingertips. Despite the poison’s toxicity, it is in fact an important ingredient in many folk remedies for lower back pain. In the past, tribal hunters in marshlands used to dip arrowheads in Croagunk poison to ensure they would be lethal. Croagunk are popular as mascot Pokémon for many teams and cities, notably including Pastoria City, Sinnoh as well as a major Galarian pharmaceutical company.","Toxicroak are generally laid-back Pokémon, found resting on damp rocks and boulders. They can become formidable foes, however, when provoked. Their flexible bodies let them weave through attacks in battle, drawing in close enough to deal their own blows. The large, vibrant poison sacs on their necks also doubles as vocal sacs; when they croak, the poison within the sacs is churned and becomes even more virulent. Even touching their skin can be fatal due to the powerful poison it is coated in. Toxicroak can regulate their poison levels to fit the situation, however, so trained ones are usually safe to touch. Tubes run down the lengths of their arms, connecting their poison sacs to their knuckles. One of their knuckles on each hand has adapted into a hollow, sharp “nail” that enables Toxicroak to viciously slash foes and penetrate their skin. When they cut, the knuckles can then secrete poison directly into the bloodstreams of victims, allowing the effects to become noticeable much more quickly than by touch. After a win in battle, Toxicroak will customarily let out a victory croak to celebrate their triumph.","Carnivine can be found in wetlands and damp forests. They use their tentacles to latch onto tree branches, dangling the rest of their bodies below. They remain immobile much of the time, disguising as plants. While waiting, they keep their mouths wide open and drool a sweetly scented saliva that attracts prey towards them. Victims approach expecting fruit or nectar, but instead are met with their jaws, which can shut closed in the blink of an eye. Once Carnivine manage to chomp down on victims, it can take a whole day for them to digest their prey, depending on its size. They can open their jaws 180º, acting like landing pads of sorts for aerial prey. They tend to dwell in areas with soil that is acidic and nutrient-poor; scientists hypothesize that they evolved to be carnivorous in order to cope with this. Poor soil quality and low levels of sunlight made it difficult for most Grass-type Pokémon to subsist solely on photosynthesis, so Carnivine evolved to consume living prey instead to survive where other Grass-types could not.","Finneon are nocturnal Pokémon, found both in shallow coral reefs and deep ocean waters. During the day, they rest at the surface to bask in sunlight. Their pink tail fin spots and side bands absorb light as they sunbathe. Then, when night falls, they travel to deeper waters as their markings begin to glow softly in a mesmerizing pink hue, releasing the gathered energy. Finneon swim in large schools; the glowing patterns produced as they swim beneath the water’s surface has been described by sailors as one of the most beautiful sights in the world. In the evening seaside resorts will often lay out food for Finneon schools in order to attract them for visitors. It is believed Finneon emit these array of lights to confuse predators. They swim by beating their two tail fins like wings in a Beautifly-like manner. This has earned them the nickname, “The Beautifly of the Sea.” They may leap out of the water when swimming, though this makes them easy targets for aerial predators. In some areas, freshwater populations of Finneon have been discovered. Some postulate that these Finneon may eventually evolve into an entirely separate species, though at this time this is not yet the case.","Upon evolution, Lumineon exclusively live in the ocean depths where little to no light penetrates. They are now able to produce their own bioluminescence and do not have to rely on the sun to gather energy. Lumineon flash light patterns on their four tail fins to attract prey; deep sea explorers have described the sight of schools of Lumineon flashing in the abyss to be akin to skies full of stars. This light also attracts predators, though; to avoid detection, they “walk” on the sea floor by using their pelvic fins as “legs,” sneaking beneath most attackers. In the deep, Lumineon’s main competitors for food are Lanturn, who are also bioluminescent hunters. The electrical powers of Lanturn put Lumineon at a disadvantage, so the latter will generally avoid confrontation with them. Curiously, perhaps due to their Beautifly-like wings, Lumineon can use a few Bug-type moves like Silver Wind in battle. They court mates by completing intricate dances involving flashing lights and flapping fins with their partners before mating.","Mantyke are very active, friendly Pokémon. They are most commonly found swimming besides or even within schools of Remoraid, skimming the surface of the water like jet skis. The patterns on their backs differ from region to region; due to their curious, playful natures, they will often approach ships to examine them, allowing passengers to glimpse their patterns. In fact, Mantyke-watching tours are common in some regions, with tourists paying money to observe them frolicking with schools of Remoraid. In some regions, swimming with them is also a popular activity for visitors. These Pokémon use their antennae to detect changes in water currents. As filter feeders, they follow these currents to find areas abundant in plankton. Once a Mantyke grow large enough, a Remoraid will attach itself to the undersides of one of its wings. It is only when this occurs that Mantyke can evolve; how this happens is as of yet unknown, though some believe that Remoraid secrete an enzyme that signals for evolution; Mantine are far less vulnerable to predators due to their size, so evolving their hosts would greatly benefit attached Remoraid. In colder regions such as Galar, these Pokémon become noticeably more sluggish in their behavior.","Snover generally live far away from humans, high up on snowy mountain peaks or deep in cold boreal forests. They are very inquisitive of people, however, and will approach human travelers with great curiosity. Large numbers of them will congregate around human footprints, attempting to discern where they came from. Snover migrate with the seasons; in the winter, they make their way down chilly mountain slopes, as the cooler weather enables them to dwell at lower altitudes. It is during this time where human contact is most likely. Once the weather warms again in the spring, they trek back up to their mountain peaks. Their bodies also grow edible white fruits along the borders of the white and brown areas of their torsos in the spring, described to taste like frozen candy; they are a favorite of Galarian Darumaka. In battle, Snover can summon blizzards that obscure the vision of foes with fog-like flurries of snow. Once their opponents are blinded, they will launch balls of ice at them before they have a chance to retaliate. In particularly harsh weather, these Pokémon will root themselves deep beneath the soil to weather strong winds as well as absorb nutrients and warm water from below, regulating their temperatures.","Abomasnow are far more elusive than Snover, with only a handful of sightings in the wild having been confirmed in the past few decades. For a long time, they were thought to be myths, going by names like “abominable snowmen,” “yetis,” and, most recently, “Ice Monsters.” Based on recent findings, Abomasnow likely only appear when snow flowers in their habitat bloom, for reasons unknown. Once the last petal falls, these Pokémon retreat back to some undiscovered location, not appearing again until the next bloom. Abomasnow can whip up terrible blizzards that make it virtually impossible to see; this is likely how they keep themselves hidden. They live exclusively on mountains perpetually covered in snow; whether Abomasnow choose to dwell in snowy areas or make the area they live in snowy is debatable. These Pokémon are surprisingly quiet, making little to no noise during their everyday lives. No clear photos of these Pokémon in the wild exist so far, due to the heavy snow that constantly surrounds them. It is said that though elusive, these Pokémon will appear to protect endangered Snover with their raging blizzards and hammer-like arms.","Weavile are vicious and ruthless; they prowl around cold forests and mountains in small packs of four or five members. They are devious and intelligent hunters, capable of devising and executing complex plans with their allies to take down foes much larger than themselves; they have even been recording hunting giant Mamoswine. They never bicker over splitting catches. To communicate, Weavile scratch markings into the frost covering trees and boulders, signaling when, where, and how to attack. Over 500 distinct markings as known. They also use these scratches to mark the boundaries of their domains. Weavile will work together to surround foes from all sides before closing in on their quarries. One Weavile may surprise the intended prey and pin it down to expose a vulnerable area while the others then strike in unison. Their main assets are their stunning agility and their razor-sharp claws, which are cold enough to inflict frostbite with their scratches. They attack foes with moves like Night Slash before they have a chance to react. Weavile also have excellent vision, letting them see even in strong blizzards. In battle, one of their claws may occasionally break off. These claws will grow back in time, though it may take up to a month to do so. The broken claws, known as Razor Claws, can be used to facilitate the evolutions of Sneasel.","Areas of high magnetic activity may alter the molecular structures of Magneton, fusing and evolving them into Magnezone. Their three magnetic apparatuses (known as “units”) generate their own magnetic fields, which Magnezone can harness in attacks like Magnet Rise and Magnetic Flux. Sometimes, when two Magnezone come together, their magnetism will be so strong that neither will be able to move; it takes an external force to separate the two. Though rare in the wild, Magnezone can be territorial; they prefer to use magnetism to repel foes rather than attack them outright. Their magnetic forces are strong enough to lift an adult human strapped into a metal harness. Strangely, Magneton can currently only evolve into Magnezone in natural magnetic fields; scientific attempts to trigger evolution through artificially generated ones have all failed. Because of their shape, many mistake floating Magnezone for UFOs. These creatures do seem to be receiving and transmitting unknown signals with their antennae, however; they also emit radar signals from these antennae to monitor their territory, honing in and blasting intruders with beams of energy.","Lickilicky have tongues drenched in saliva, which is abnormally acidic when compared to the saliva of other Pokémon; it can dissolve even stone given time. It appears to be a cocktail of many different, complex substances. The drool also contains a compound that causes numbness upon contact; this sensation does not fade on its own and requires medical attention to cure. The numbing substance appears to have a dulling effect on nerves under the skin, leading to the loss of feeling in affected areas. Their tongues are extremely long; they capture prey by constricting victims ​with their tongues like ropes as their saliva begins to dissolve and paralyze them. The current record-holding Lickilicky has a tongue that just barely extends over 82 feet (25 m). Their first instinct when they come across something unfamiliar is to lick it, as they associate and remembers things based on their textures and tastes. Consequently, drawing too close to Lickilicky may lead to becoming drenched in saliva. Their tongues are in fact quite dextrous, and are used to pick up small objects in place of their clumsier hands. Their mouths are very spacious, as they have enough room for their rolled-up tongues to fit within. Additionally, they have wells in their mouths to hold and store excess saliva.","Rhyperior live in areas with lots of exposed, loose rocks. They sometimes make their way into artificial quarries to use the mined stone in battle. They can shove rocks into the holes in their hands; by quickly tightening and expanding their arm muscles, they can launch out these rocks like missiles. This is how they use devastating moves like Rock Wrecker to overpower opponents. Sometimes, they may launch Geodude or Roggenrola camouflaging as boulders, mistaking them for real rocks. Their durable carapaces are capable of withstanding volcanic eruptions. In battle, they will often wait for the foe to strike first, letting the attacks bounce harmlessly off of their bodies before counterattacking with their drills. Rhyperior also use these drills to dig through mountains and cliffs. They can then use the rubble as more ammo for their attacks. If threatened without any rocks available, they are still more than capable of defending themselves. Rhyperior can use their powerful drills to use Horn Drill, for instance, to take down foes. They can also swing their club-like tails at opponents when threatened; their immense weight often makes such blows crippling, if not outright fatal.","Tangrowth hide within dense patches of shrubbery, disguising themselves as large bushes. They patiently wait for prey to wander by before ensnaring them with their long vines. These vines are surprisingly genetically similar to kelp. They grow at an amazing rate; during the warm springtime, the vines grow so quickly that it becomes impossible to see the eyes or feet of these Pokémon. Their arms also appear to be modified bunches of vines. They are capable of extending to twice their normal size, as much of their length is actually stored within the tangles of vines covering up the rest of the Pokémon’s bodies. Tangrowth rarely need to move, as they can bind and carry things they needs directly to them. Their vines have spectacular regenerative properties. Should predators bite off one of their arms, for example, Tangrowth would be able to grow them back quickly with no noticeable differences. In fact, they may even break off strands of their own, wriggling vines to distract foes as they flee; the vines will simply regrow later.","Electivire tend to be short-tempered, aggressive Pokémon. They also often act brashly without consequences; they are known to charge headfirst into the attacks of foes while attempting to land blows of their own. Electivire fry opponents to a crisp by touching their two tails to them; doing so completes the circuit between the tails, causing 20,000 volts of electricity to surge through their foes. They can also grab their own tails to charge up their fists and deliver electrifying punches. As they attack, blue sparks may be seen sparking through their two horns.  Electivire are very rare Pokémon in the wild, as their evolutions require a tremendous and sudden surge of electrical energy. This normally can only be achieved through the use of Electirizers to store the necessary energy. Lightning strikes have been known to trigger evolution in Electabuzz, however; additionally, some Electabuzz feeding at power plants have been recorded to siphon enough electricity to evolve, generally at the cost of compromising the power grids in the local areas. Conversely, a single Electivire can also produce enough electricity to power a city if harnessed properly. When excited, Electvire will pound their chests, letting loose showers of sparks and thundering roars.","Magmortar are rare in the wild due to their need for constant, intense heat. Evolution from Magmar normally requires the tremendous heat energy packed within Magmarizers, though natural evolutions involving eruptions have also been recorded. Magmortar are exclusively found deep within active volcanic craters capable of producing the immense heat they need; a single pair of mates will call a whole crater its own. To defend themselves, Magmortar can launch fireballs reaching temperatures of 3,600°F (2,000°C) from their cannon-like arms. When they do so, the sheer, blistering heat makes them briefly glow a whitish hue; they may even begin to melt their own arms when attacking (though magma will heal them). As this incinerates the opponent to a crisp, however, they rarely use this when hunting prey. Even their breaths are very hot, audibly sizzling when they exhale. These breaths can sear meat within seconds and have been known to start forest fires in drier areas. Despite their potential dangers, Magmortar are not a very aggressive species, likely due to having few threats in their volcanic homes; they generally will not attack unless provoked. In some older factories, Magmortar are still used to process raw metals.","Togekiss are very rarely sighted in the wild. They are believed to only appear during peaceful times, avoiding periods of strife. In folklore, they were seen as omens of good fortune by the poor and desolate. Togekiss are said to shower blessings onto those who respect the rights of others and avoid needless conflict. These Pokémon are highly intelligent and very in tune to the emotions of others. They are capable of recognizing the facial expressions and social cues of people and Pokémon alike, and will react to them accordingly. Little is known about how they mate or raise young in the wild, due to their elusiveness. Most wild Togepi are produced by Togetic. However, from studies of the species in captivity, it is likely that Togekiss mate for life and raise their offspring until they evolve and can leave the nest on their own. Both parents are thought to spend equal amounts of time raising their children. In the past few decades or so, sightings of wild Togekiss have become even less frequent than they have been in the past. Whether this is indicative of the state of the world today or simply a coincidence is unknown.","Yanmega are considered by some scientists to be “living fossils,” having remained virtually unchanged since prehistoric times. Ancient fossils and wing prints uncovered during excavations perfectly match with Yanmega alive today. In modern times, these Pokémon makes their homes in damp woodlands and swamps. They are brutal attackers, equipped with myriad abilities to take down foes (and often violently so). For example, they can rapidly beat their wings to create shock waves strong enough to dislodge trees; such blasts can easily cause internal injuries in surrounding life. They are also skilled at using their powerful jaws to tear apart foes in mid-flight. In battle, these tactics manifest as moves like Sonic Boom and Bug Bite. Yanmega are strong enough to carry adult humans into the air. They use the wings on their tails to keep balanced while flying. Yanmega are extraordinarily swift fliers, capable of nearing the speed of sound when unburdened. They are a territorial species and will defend their homes viciously when threatened.","Eevee raised in heavily wooded areas, particularly those with clean air and plenty of moss, will likely evolve into Leafeon. Leafeon gain almost all of their energy from the sun; all of their surface cells are photosynthetic, not just the dark green, leaf-like growths. Because of this, Leafeon are always cloaked in pure, fresh air. They can often be seen taking naps in sunlit clearings near clear streams, storing energy for the rest of the day. When the weather gets cloudy, Leafeon may consume Berries to tide themselves over until better weather, but they cannot survive entirely without the sun. They are pacifists that avoid confrontation at all costs. Though they can sharpen their tails and strike back with moves like Leaf Blade, they rarely do so except in dire situations or to protect their friends. Still, the cutting edges of their leaves are sharp enough to slice a tree in half. Leafeon can become ill from trips into polluted cities, as they normally are surrounded by clean air. Similarly, they cannot tolerate prolonged deprivation from sunlight. Because of this, most Leafeon trainers tend to dwell in or near rural communities or forests. Young Leafeon are said to smell like fresh grass, while older ones smell like fallen leaves. A popular Galarian perfume is distilled from this aroma.","Eevee that are trained in chilly areas, particularly those that are covered in ice year-round, tend to evolve into Glaceon. Glaceon have the ability to consciously control their body temperature; by lowering it, they can freeze their fur and make it stand on end like icy needles. They can then tackle or fire these needles at foes. They can drop their body temperature as low as -75°F (-60°C). Glaceon can freeze the surrounding moisture by cooling their bodies, creating beautiful flurries of suspended ice crystals. The flurries sparkle like diamonds in the sunlight. They use the glittering mist to cloak themselves from attackers, letting them flee while their foes are distracted. Alternatively, they can also freeze air moisture into larger pellets to shoot at enemies. Unlike most Pokémon that live in cold areas, their fur is not very thick. In fact, their bodies are often colder than the surrounding air, which is what lets them to freeze water vapor by absorbing ambient heat. In battle, Glaceon can launch the powerful Blizzard to freeze foes. Their tendency to absorb heat means that they don’t fare well in warmer cliimates; Glaceon trainers usually live in areas that are permanently icy because of this. Because of their snow-creating abilities, they are also commonly employed at mountain ski resorts.","Gliscor are nocturnal Pokémon; they spend the day hidden in shaded areas, hanging upside-down from tree branches by their tails. In this position, they will also cloak themselves with their black, cape-like membranes. When night falls, they will remain hanging silently until prey wander by. Then, they swoop down and grasp their victims with their tails before biting their necks to inject a paralyzing venom. Gliscor will then carry their meals back to their nests, where they will tear into them using their pincer-like claws. They do not flap their wings to fly, but rather catch breezes under their membranes. If there is no wind, they will leap off of trees and glide as far as they can. They are said to be able to soar around the entire world on lone breezes. Gliscor are adept hunters, skilled at targeting the weak points of foes to score critical hits.  They navigate through the darkness with echolocation. Shed Gliscor fangs are known as Razor Fangs and can be used to help Gligar evolve. Gliscor will grow the fangs back in time.","Mamoswine have been around since the last major ice age, during which they were thought to have roamed in large herds all around the world. They were a common subject of ancient cave paintings from the era. As the climate warmed, glaciers began to retreat, and their populations began to thin. Mamoswine are now very rare in the wild, found only in areas that are permanently frozen over. The species caused much uproar in the scientific community when a specimen found in frozen soil dating back 10,000 years was successfully thawed and, to the world’s surprise, woke up dazed but otherwise alive. Scientists already knew that Mamoswine could hibernate for long periods of time and withstand subzero temperatures (thanks to their thick fur and insulating blubber), but the frozen specimen was a testament to their hardiness. Their tusks are made of pure ice, fortunately making the already-rare Pokémon undesirable to poachers. In colder climates, these tusks grow even larger and more impressive. Despite their size, Mamoswine are not very aggressive. Because they rarely see people, however, human contact may frighten them and cause them to attack.","Silph Co. refused to acknowledge the existence of Porygon-Z for many years until their notoriety became too great to bear. Porygon-Z are obtained by upgrading the software of Porygon2 with Dubious Discs; as their names suggest, the discs have rather questionable origins. While no one is exactly sure who created the items, rumors suggest that it was the same group of hackers that had purportedly cracked Silph Co.’s improved DRM on Porygon2. Porygon-Z are thought to have been planned to be capable of interdimensional travel, for reasons unknown due to the lack of information regarding their creators. However, they failed in that regard (at least, the version available to the public did). Instead, they are far more powerful than Porygon2 at the cost of their stability. Porygon-Z are frailer and notably more glitchy. Their movements are highly erratic due to the numerous bugs in their programming, likely due to the haphazard nature of their creation. While Silph Co. remains adamant that Porygon-Z are unauthorized updates, it has ceased attempts to take action against them or their owners.","Gallade are known for their swordsmanship and chivalry. They refuse to attack foes weaker than them unless they have some sort of handicap to make the fights fair. They hold honor in the highest regard and will graciously accept losses as long as they fought courageously. Gallade will always fight for what they believe is right, no matter what the cost. They are very loyal and will gladly lay down their lives to protect their allies. In combat, they extend the blades on their elbows and brandish them like swords. They can use these blades to both slash at foes and parry incoming attacks. They can read their opponents’ thoughts, allowing them to fiercely strike at any given opportunity. They will fight most valiantly when defending someone they love. Due to their gallantry, Gallade will never slay foes in combat under normal circumstances. Should their honor be sullied, however, they may challenge offenders to duels to the death, going to great lengths to ensure that participants will be on even footing during such matches. Wild Gallade will roam the land, searching for opportunities to defend those in need.","Like Nosepass, Probopass are very slow and remain immobile most of the time. Their “mustaches” are actually iron filings attracted to their magnetic noses, pulled from iron-rich rocks in their caves. Probopass consume metallic objects, pulling them close with magnetic force. Their magnetism also enables them to freely control the three units surrounding their bodies, known as “Mini-Noses.” Unlike Probopass themselves, these Mini-Noses are very quick. Probopass use these units to scout their surroundings, as they are capable of sensing fluctuations in the local magnetic field. They can then use this information to determine where metal is most abundant and begin making their gradual ways to such areas. Probopass can also use these units to pester attackers and drive them away; since they can control each of their Mini-Noses individually, they can harass foes from three directions at once (four, if one includes the Probopass themselves) to make up for their own sluggishness. These units do almost all of the work for their main bodies, which primarily issue commands and do little else. However, they can get lost if they stray too far away, forcing Probopass to search (or send its remaining Mini-Noses to search) for them. Because of their powerful magnetic fields, electronics tend to malfunction around them.","Dusknoir are strongly associated with death in popular culture. They are thought to be able to travel freely between this world and the spirit world, taking anything or anyone within the mouth-like openings on their stomachs with them. They are believed to only take souls with them to the spirit world, discharging physical bodies from their orifices. The antennae on their heads are said to pick up electrical signals from the world of the dead; these signals are instructions for them to carry out in the physical world. Dusknoir guide lost spirits into the spirit world by placing them into the orifices on their stomachs and ferrying them out of this realm. They alway seem to have agendas to carry out, only leading certain spirits and certain times while leaving others alone. If their antennae are damaged, they will begin to wander about aimlessly in the physical world until they heal. Some say that these Pokémon have no wills of their own, instead only carrying out the orders they receive from afar. Many legends tell of Dusknoir taking living spirits to the world of the dead for various reasons: to reunite with lost loved ones, to punish dark souls, or even to show them glimpses of their inevitable futures. Some say that Dusknoir only ferry pure spirits, while the Pokémon Lampent burn evil ones.","Froslass are mysterious Pokémon, found in deep, remote areas constantly cloaked in snowstorms. Because of their habitats, Froslass are rarely ever encountered by humans. Their bodies are actually completely hollow; they move around by floating just a few inches off of the ground. They uses their frigid breath, which can be as low as -58°F (-50°C), to freeze unsuspecting prey solid. They have a macabre habit of displaying their frozen victims in hidden areas; though mountain travelers rarely ever encounter Froslass themselves (or at least, rarely survive such encounters), some have discovered icy caverns with frozen corpses gruesomely stuck onto the walls and littered around the floor. These display are generally not where Froslass nest (in fact, they are is often far away from them), so their purpose is unknown. A popular legend states that Froslass are the spirits of women who froze to death during mountain blizzards, possessing icicles to seek revenge on other mountain travelers and feasting on the souls of men. It is said that they only freeze male hikers they believe are handsome before carrying them back to their lairs. In mountain villages, children are sometimes warned that Frosslass will come down to visit human villages during blizzards; hearing knocking on the door during a snowstorm is a sign that a Froslass has come to visit.","Rotom are mischievous Pokémon that enjoy playing pranks on others. They have the unique ability to possess electronic devices and use them as they please; oftentimes, this means causing them to malfunction or act unexpectedly to bewilder users. Their bodies are composed almost entirely of plasma, giving them their electrical abilities. Recent research has led to a promising discovery; their ability to possess electrical appliances could possibly help power a unique motor that would work far more efficiently than any design that currently exists. Indeed, there has been much progress in the development of new and improved Rotom-efficient appliances. In battle, while their Electric-typings remain constant throughout all of their forms, their other type can be influenced by the machine they are possessing. While trained Rotom can possess electronics and leave them entirely unharmed, wild ones tend to short out the circuits of devices they enter. They appear to have affinities for old televisions; they will briefly flash their maniacally grinning faces for just a split second before returning to standard programming to frighten watchers. ","The rich mythology of the Sinnoh region has ingrained the three lake guardians—Uxie, Mesprit, and Azelf—with the success of humanity as a species. Uxie is known as “The Being of Knowledge” and is said to have been created by Arceus to gift humans with intellect; its creation was also the birth of knowledge as a concept. It was this that enabled humans to solve problems and improve their lives. Uxie is believed to reside in Sinnoh’s Acuity Cavern, though it is thought to venture out to places where people come to learn—schools and libraries, for example. As Uxie gifted humans with knowledge, it can also take it away; Uxie will open its eyes when threatened to wipe the memories of those who gaze into them. It is also able to teleport itself and others and as leave its physical body temporarily as a spirit. Legend has it that if one manages to capture and extract the jewels of the lake guardians and link them, the resulting Red Chain will be able to control any being in the world, commanding its thoughts, emotions, and actions.","Mesprit is the second of the lake guardians; like Uxie, it can also teleport those around it (as well as itself) and leave its physical body behind as a spirit for short periods of time. It is said that when Arceus created Mesprit, the concept of emotions was also born. Mesprit gifted humans with the ability to feel, and as such is known as “The Being of Emotion.” It rests in or around Verity Cavern in Sinnoh; it is said that a person experiencing passionate emotions may see its spirit shimmering on the surface of Verity Lake. It also is thought to make its way to places where humans tend to ​express their feelings most opening, joyful (like at festivals) or sad (like at memorials). People say that anyone who dares touch Mesprit will be robbed of all emotions and left unable to feel anything at all. It is thought that the jewels on Mesprit’s body can be combined with its siblings’ into the Red Chain, which can control any being in existence. Only the most evil-hearted being in the world, however, would be able to commit such a vile act.","Azelf normally makes its home in Sinnoh’s Acuity Cavern. It may also venture out into isolated areas that would take travelers tremendous determination to reach: mountain peaks, remote islands, and dangerous cliffs, for example. This is because Azelf is “The Being of Willpower,” created by Arceus along with the concept of determination. It gifted humans with the strength to endure hardships and weather pain. Like its siblings, it is able to teleport itself and others as well as temporarily leave its body as a spirit. Those who dare to try to harm Azelf will find themselves unable to move, having lost all willpower to do anything at all. In Sinnoh mythology, the three lake guardians were all born from the same egg. Extracting and linking Azelf’s gems with the other guardians’ is said create the Red Chain; the object is reviled in legends for going against everything Pokémon training stands for. By robbing the victim of its ability to make its own decisions, the Red Chain would destroy a critical bond dating back centuries.","Along with the other two members of the dimension trio, Dialga is said to be among the first beings created by Arceus. It rules over time itself; in fact, according to Sinnoh mythology, time only began to flow when Dialga was born. It is said that time flows in accordance to the tempo of Dialga’s heartbeat. This Pokémon is worshipped as an ancient deity in Sinnoh. It is believed to have the power to stop, start, slow down, and speed up time. Additionally, it is said to be able to freely travel temporally. Dialga is believed to dwell in a dimension separate from this world, and is ​thought to be capable of interdimensional travel. It is said to be constantly fighting with Palkia in this alternate dimension for control of the entire physical world. Sinnoh legend states that catastrophic consequences would follow if Dialga ever entered this world; the only way to subdue this Pokémon once it is angered is to enlist the help of the lake guardians; only a being with great knowledge, emotion, and willpower would be able to quell this rampaging beast.","Palkia is worshipped in Sinnoh as an ancient deity. Along with the rest of the dimension trio, it is thought to have been among the first beings Arceus created. This Pokémon presides over space and is said to be able to warp it at will. This allows it to travel anywhere in an instant, including through dimensions. According to Sinnoh legend, space becomes more stable with every breath that Palkia takes. In fact, the region’s folklore states that space was only created once Palkia was born. Palkia is thought to reside in a separate dimension, along with its counterpart Dialga. It is believed to be in constant conflict with Dialga for control over both space and time, and thus the physical world as a whole. It is said that in its quest to defeat Dialga, Palkia may make its way into this realm, where it will wreak tremendous havoc. The only way to calm the enraged Pokémon would be to request the aid of the three lake guardians, as it would take a being that possesses great knowledge, willpower, and emotion to undertake such a daunting task.","Heatran lives deep within the craters of active volcanoes, often found resting within pools of magma. Its body is made of hard steel; however, the immense temperature of its surroundings has deformed parts of its body and completely melted others. Heatran’s blood is constantly boiling from the heat of its environment, only contributing to its own melting; its blood is almost as hot as the magma around it. This Pokémon’s insides are so hot that when it opens its mouth, an orange glow can be seen emanating from within. Its cross-shaped feet are adept at digging into rocks, enabling it to scale vertical walls and even travel upside-down on cave ceilings. It is said that Heatran can only be controlled by a being wielding its Magma Stone, a rock with a molten core found within the very volcano in which this Pokémon resides. Removing the stone from its proper place, however, would cause Heatran to go berserk and cause its volcano to erupt. It is said to be able to trap foes who anger it or threaten its volcano in maelstroms of lava by using Magma Storm.","In Sinnoh mythology, Regigigas towed the continents into their current arrangement using nothing more than rope. It is thought to communicate via both telepathy and the flashing lights on its head. According to legend, Regigigas crafted three Pokémon in its likeness out of clay, ice, and magma. The three beings were entirely subservient to Regigigas and would obey its commands above all else. Along with its servants, Regigigas stopped a volcanic eruption in the area now known as Snowpoint City, Sinnoh. After that, it began a centuries-long slumber deep within Snowpoint Temple, sending its servants to a distant region (Hoenn). It is said that anyone seeking to awaken this Pokémon would need to bring its three guardians to it first. Regigigas is believed to be tremendously durable, capable of traveling through practically any terrain and withstanding temperatures both as low as -328°F (-200°C) and as high as 2,400°F (1,300°C). Some say that Regigigas will shoot beams out of its eyes at anyone attempting to awaken it without bringing its guardians.","In Sinnoh mythology, Arceus created Giratina alongside Dialga and Palkia. It is often excluded when discussing Sinnoh’s major deities, however; according to legend, it was banished into a warped dimension completely opposite of ours for some unknown act of violence. This dimension is referred to as the Distortion (or Reverse, in some texts) World. Giratina is said to take a different, freer form in this dimension, known as its Origin Forme. The stronger gravity of our world is thought to place confines on Giratina, forcing it to transform into a more restricted form known as its Altered Forme; an artifact known as the Griseous Orb is said to allow it to retain its Origin Forme in this world. Giratina appears to have a connection with death, often seen in visions by people visiting cemeteries. It also is believed to be able to use reflective objects as portals between dimensions. Though rarely mentioned in legends, the few myths that do refer to it describe it as spending eternity gazing enviously into this world and its inhabitants.","Cresselia resides on the mysterious Fullmoon Island near Sinnoh, only leaving the island on nights of the crescent moon. During this time, a beautiful aurora extends and undulates mesmerizingly from its tail. Cresselia is said to be the embodiment of the crescent moon itself. As it floats, the crescents on its body release a shimmering, star-like powder that trails behind it like a glittering veil. These particles reflect the light of the moon most strikingly, particularly that of the crescent moon. Cresselia is often seen as a counterpart—a rival, even—to Darkrai; while Darkrai has the ability to cause nightmares and embodies the new moon, Cresselia is able to dispel bad dreams and replace them with happier ones, and also symbolizes the crescent moon. In fact, holding one of this Pokémon’s feathers while dozing off is said to guarantee a blissful sleep filled with sweet dreams. Shed Cresselia feathers, also known as Lunar Wings, are thought to be the only way to wake up those put to sleep by Darkrai, save for the appearance of Cresselia itself.","Phione are unique in that they are the only known Pokémon to be born to a legendary. They float on the surface of warm seas, carried about by ocean currents. The bulbs on their heads are flotation sacs that keep them from sinking; they can deflate them when they wish to dive below. In warmer weather, groups of Phione may be found drifting together on the same currents. Despite exerting very little control while traveling, they have uncanny senses of direction that ensure they will always know how to find their way back home; indeed, during mating season, they will return to the places they were born to mate and lay their eggs. Whether or not Phione should be considered legendaries is a topic of dispute, even among top researchers. On one hand, they are related to the legendary Pokémon Manaphy and are generally considered legendaries among Sinnoh residents, the region where they are the most popular. On the other, they are not particularly rare or strong like other legendaries and can breed to produce other Phione; no other legendary can do so.","Manaphy is said to have been born on the cold sea floor. It is often called the “Prince of the Sea.” Manaphy’s body is 80% water, making it very susceptible to changes in its environment; its membrane-like skin allows water to pass in and out of its body easily through osmosis. Polluted water can make it very ill, so it only swims in clean, remote areas. Manaphy has the unique ability to bond with any living being, enabling it to understand the emotions of those around it with ease. By using Heart Swap, it can also switch the minds of any two individuals. Manaphy is said to seek out feuding companions and use its powers to swap their minds. It seeks to solve conflicts by forcing opponents to see issues from their foes’ perspectives. Like Phione, Manaphy remembers its birthplace and will return to it to give birth (consequently, all Phione will migrate to the same spot as well). Manaphy is also uniqeuly the only known legendary that is able to breed; the eggs it produces hatch into Phione, though, rather than other Manaphy, so most still consider it a legendary Pokémon.","Darkrai is said to dwell on Newmoon Island near Sinnoh, venturing into cities during the new moon. It is heavily associated with bad dreams and is believed to be able to cause unending, nightmare-filled slumbers through its mere presence. Those put to sleep by Darkrai are said to experience endless torment through their worst fears; seeing a mysterious, shadowy figure is a common theme among victims—many believe this figure to be Darkrai itself. Darkrai appears to be attracted to nightmares, and may in fact feed off of them. It has the ability to turn into a shadow and travel silently through the night. Its body is intangible and changeable; many sightings of this Pokémon describe long, spindly legs extending from its body. The light of the moon is said to scare this Pokémon away. Lunar Wings are thought to be the only way to wake Darkrai’s victims. Some believe that Darkrai only causes nightmares as a defense mechanism, and that it is not truly evil. It is believed to only actively put to sleep those who approach its island.","Shaymin is said to curl up in flower patches, camouflaging seamlessly into its surroundings. It is strongly connected with the concept of gratitude; the flowers on its back bloom when it senses gratefulness. It enjoys being picked up and hugged, though it can be very timid at times. Shaymin is able to neutralize toxins in the air and cause barren wastelands to turn into lush gardens overnight. In Sinnoh mythology, the settlement of Floaroma Town was once barren and inhospitable. One day, a young man who lived in the area expressed his gratitude for simply being alive despite the bleakness around him. Suddenly, the land bloomed into a field of beautiful flowers, turning Floaroma Town into what it is today. Shaymin has an affinity for beautiful Gracidea Flowers; the blooms’ pollen can turn Shaymin into its Sky Forme and grant it with the power of flight. In this form, it is much more passionate and active. It will revert back to its shyer Land Forme when the weather becomes cold or the sun sets, however.","Arceus is thought to be the creator of the world in Sinnoh mythology. It is said to have born into nothingness as an egg, and according to legend, fashioned the entire universe using its 1,000 hands. Arceus is believed to have created and preside over the lake guardian and the creation trios. Though virtually never seen, many believe that Arceus will appear when the world is in peril to defend its creation. Arceus can manipulate anything in the universe, including space and time. It is able to recreate objects that have been destroyed and remove items from existence. Mysterious ​items known as Plates appear to be related to Arceus, and are thought to allow it to assume any type it chooses. It is believed that Arceus can be summoned into this world by playing a mysterious artifact mentioned in ancient legends and known as the Azure Flute; to date, no one has discovered the flute, leading many to believe that it does not actually exist. In ancient texts, Arceus is rarely mentioned by its actual name, instead being referred to as “The Original One.”","Victini is said to be the embodiment of victory itself. Its body is thought to be overflowing with energy, which it is constantly transferring to others around it through contact. Many believe that having Victini on one’s side during a battle will guarantee success. For this reason, this elusive Pokémon has been long sought after by trainers. Victini never dwells in the same spot for long, however; its tremendous energy keeps it constantly flying about, using its wing-like tails to stay aloft. Legend has it that a selfish trainer once attempted to trap Victini on the secluded Liberty Island near ​Unova in hopes of guaranteeing his own perpetual success. The trainer, however, never won a battle for the rest of his life, because a victory must be earned to be true. Some believe Victini still returns to Liberty Island to this day. Victini is often depicted holding up two of its fingers in the shape of a “V,” symbolizing “victory.” It can ignite the crest on its head to unleash its near-infinitesimal energy in powerful, but draining, attacks like Searing Shot and V-Create.","Many trainers in Unova choose to begin their journeys with Snivy as their starter Pokémon. Unlike the Grass-type starters of other regions, however, Snivy are famous for their fickle natures and smug attitudes, contrasting the laid-back personalities of Pokémon like Chikorita or Chespin. Snivy will always keep their heads held up high. They are known to refuse orders they consider “unbecoming” or “unworthy;” in fact, Snivy may even persuade other Pokémon to complete tasks they do not want to finish for them. Despite their haughty personalities, however, Snivy are also very calm and intelligent. Though they dislike combat, they will stay collected when attacked and always think before acting. Though their arms are usable, Snivy are more adept at using vines to handle objects. The leaves on their tails photosynthesize energy, making Snivy faster in bright sunlight. These leaves will also droop when Snivy are ill. Despite their smugness, their calm natures and intelligence make Snivy popular amongst trainers in Unova.","When Snivy evolve into Servine, they maintains both their haughtiness and their impressive intellects. Their arms have withered from disuse, as Servine manipulate their surroundings almost exclusively with their vines. They photosynthesize energy using the various leaves on their bodies; however, they cannot do this well when their leaves are dirty, so Servine spend much of their spare time cleaning them in broad daylight to ensure maximum efficiency in energy production. Servine consider themselves “above” eating like most Pokémon do; as a result, even trained ones may refuse food in favor of basking in sunlight to photosynthesize. Though they can stand bipedally, Servine usually move around by slithering on their bellies. They defend themselves from foes with surprising agility, slithering swiftly between the legs of enemies to disorient them before lashing out with their vines. Servine are also known to use the shade of the thick foliage in their habitats to their advantage, hiding in the darkness to avoid attacks.","Like Snivy and Servine, Serperior are infamous for their smugness and intellect. They always keep their heads held high, even in combat; in fact, they may even use this stance to intimidate foes in battle. Serperior consider most opponents unworthy of their time, and as a result will often ignore or only halfheartedly retaliate against weaker foes. When confronted with opponents that prove to be their equals, however, they will let their true power show. Their glares are said to freeze weaker foes dead in their tracks. Though both their arms and legs have withered away from lack of ​use, Serperior are still very swift Pokémon. They use their entire bodies to photosynthesize and create energy for their attacks, amplifying this energy internally when faced with stronger foes. In battle, they can confound foes with moves like Leaf Tornado should they feel they are worth the effort. Even with their haughtiness, the great agility and cleverness of Serperior have made them mainstays in the teams of many Unova trainers.","Trainers who choose Tepig as their starters may be surprised to learn that Tepig actually resemble their evolutions very little, in terms of personality. While Pignite and Emboar can best be described as “feisty” and “outgoing,” Tepig can more aptly be referred to as “laid-back” and “bashful.” In the wild, Tepig wander idly through fields and grasslands in search of Berries. When they find some, they roast them with fire before consuming them. Tepig can be deceptively nimble when necessary, capable of leaping away of incoming attacks. They shoot fireballs out of their nostrils to deter foes. When ill, however, they will begin spewing black smoke instead. Though initially shy, Tepig are quick to warm up to new things and are very easily excited (foreshadowing the personalities of Pignite and Emboar). They have been known to burn Berries by snorting too much fire when roasting them due to enthusiasm. Thanks to their unique personalities and firepower, Tepig remain common choices for starter Pokémon in Unova.","Pignite spend much of their time eating; they have internal fires constantly burning in their bellies, so they must eat regularly in order to maintain these flames. Their attacks become stronger as their fires burn hotter. When in danger or upset, Pignite can force their fires to flare up and burn through stored lipids in order to unleash powerful attacks. Their movements also become sharper and more agile as their flames intensify. Pignite are also skilled fighters, particularly when it comes to wrestling. They are close-range brawlers; though capable of shooting flames from a distance, they prefer to attack foes using their limbs or even their whole bodies. When Pignite begin to feel hungry, their internal fires will weaken from lack of fuel. Consequently, they will become sluggish and their attacks will weaken. Letting a Pignite’s fire completely die out is extremely dangerous for the Pokémon, possibly even fatal. Because of this, Pignite trainers are advised to always carry around fat-rich snacks in case their Pokémon begin to feel famished.","Though they appear intimidating, Emboar are very friendly Pokémon—if a bit impulsive at times. They are very active, spending most of their days either eating or training. Their fists are highly resistant to heat; the red bands on their wrists secrete a highly flammable substance that coat their hands. In combat, Emboar touch their hands to their flaming beards, igniting them and allowing them to pummel opponents with flaming fists. Emboar are adept at many types of combat, switching between using their arms, feet, or entire bodies frequently to bewilder foes. They are capable of cloaking their bodies in flames to ram into foes by using Heat Crash and can also let loose streams of flames from their nostrils. Emboar are protective of their friends, often using their large bodies to shield them from harm. Their fiery beards flare up when they feel strong emotions. Their lively personalities and protective tendencies, along with their great skill in combat, have made Emboar popular Pokémon for many Unova trainers.","Many trainers pick Oshawott at the beginnings of their journeys in Unova based on their cuteness. Though these Pokémon may act tough, they are also quick to cower and flee when situations become too intense. Oshawott fight primarily using the shells on their bellies, often called “scalchops.” These implements can be detached at will, and can be reattached in a much like suction cups. Oshawott are born with scalchops attached; simple shells found on beaches will not suffice as substitutes. Scalchops consist primarily of a combination of chitin and calcium carbonate—their composition is nearly identical to that of an Oshawott’s claws (which are normally retracted). Scalchops are as sharp as blades; they are used to slash at foes and keep them at bay. Oshawott also use scalchops to slice open hard Berries when eating and thick vines when traveling. Because they rely on their scalchops so heavily, Oshawott will guard them with their lives. Their unique weaponry and charming personalities make them a common choice for Unova trainers.","Dewott are capable of wielding two scalchops at once. They take great care of their scalchops, spending much of their time cleaning them in the water or sharpening them on boulders. Dewott are very disciplined fighters. They will practice for hours at the same time every day, regardless of weather, sickness, or any other ailments. In combat, they are able to perfectly execute a wide variety of techniques thanks to their dedicated practice. In order to constantly confound opponents, Dewott will develop original fighting techniques exclusive to them. When two Dewott meet, they will engage in a friendly duel in which each will show off their signature techniques, hoping to earn the respect of the other in combat. Dewott tend to live alone, but are not territorial and will allow docile people and Pokémon to wander through without conflict. Even trained Dewott will often prefer to remain alone, particularly when practicing. Despite their solitude, Dewott are very protective of their friends and families and will not hesitate to aid their loved ones if threatened.","Samurott are famous for their valiant natures and fighting prowess. These Pokémon have a variety of weapons at their disposals. They can ram into opponents with their sharp horns to impale them, for instance. The two plated growths on their forelimbs are also actually “sheaths” concealing adapted scalchops that resemble daggers, known as “seamitars.” In battle, Samurott can stand on their hind legs and wield both of their seamitars to slash fearsomely at foes. They can use Razor Shell in battle to a similar effect. Their skilled fighting techniques have garnered them much respect ​in their coastal habitats; a single glare or roar from a Samurott is often enough to scare off enemies. Though intimidating, Samurott are very protective of their loved ones, always choosing to protect their friends and family over themselves. They will never attack foes weaker than themselves, and they are known to help fend off attackers from smaller or younger Pokémon. Their selfness natures and fearsome battling abilities have made them very popular among Unova trainers.","Patrat live in large groups known as “mobs” (or, in some areas, “manors”). They dig complex networks of underground tunnels with many openings to the surface, allowing them to covertly travel nearly anywhere without being exposed to aboveground predators. Each opening of these network will always have a Patrat standing on guard, no matter what time it is. Guard Patrat are intensely alert, sometimes not blinking for minutes. In their attentiveness, however, most Patrat tend to ignore looking behind themselves, and thus are vulnerable to attacks from the rear. Their great peripheral vision makes them quick to notice foes coming from the sides, however. Patrat will become anxious when even a single hole is left unguarded, and will refuse to leave their tunnels until an “all-clear” signal is given by every one of the guards. They wave their tails to communicate with others. They are able to store food in their cheek pouches to bring back to their nests; members of a mob will store their food communally in one large pile.","Watchog never blink or close their eyes, even when submerged underwater. Like Patrat, they live in large groups (though these groups are known as “clans” rather than “mobs”). These Pokémon can go for days without sleep and can remain standing completely still for similar periods of time.  Watchog are constantly on the lookout for danger. Members of a clan will arrange themselves so that they can see approaching foes from every angle. When Watchog spot trouble, their tails will stand straight on end and the fluorescent bands on their body along with their eyes will glow, both alerting their allies and unnerving approaching enemies; the initial flash of light has been known to temporarily blind attackers. Their friends will scramble back into their tunnels and shovel as many seeds as they can in their cheek pouches (like Patrat, Watchog keep their food in a communal pile underground), surfacing back up to shoot kernels at the foes. Watchog have great night vision, on par with their vision in broad daylight.","Lillipup are highly popular Pokémon, both in battle and as pets. They are known for their bravery, loyalty, intelligence, and adorableness. Lillipup use their long facial hairs to detect subtle changes in air currents and help them detect approaching foes. These Pokémon will fearlessly stand their ground when confronted. However, they quickly assess situations to determine risk and are smart enough to back down from foes that are too strong. Lillipup are very loyal and are quick to defend their trainers and allies. Though their senses of smell are above average, they rely moreso on their fur to learn about their environments. In wet weather, their fur becomes matted and begins to clump, severely hindering their abilities to analyze their surroundings. It is important to keep Lillipup dry in order to avoid this; such a task may be difficult, however, as they also enjoy swimming and jumping into puddles. Trainers with Lillipup are advised to carry around towels to keep their Pokémon dry. Lillipup do not bark, making them well suited to trainers living in small apartments.","The relationship between humans and Herdier dates back many centuries—some scientists even believe that they had begun cooperating with humans even before the practice of Pokémon training. In the past, Herdier aided hunters in pursuing prey, cutting off fleeing game and helping drag carcasses back to villages. They are extremely loyal Pokémon, perhaps even to a fault; Herdier will always obey their trainers’ commands, even if doing so would put them in danger. They are very wary of strangers, however. Today, Herdier remain common sights in both rural and urban areas.On farms, they help herd and defend livestock, while in cities, they are often kept as pets and hailed for their loyalty. Herdier are believed to have even helped people raise other Pokémon in older times, leading many to believe that the practice of raising Herdier was a precursor to modern-day Pokémon training. Recently, cave paintings depicting Herdier and humans working together have been discovered in Unova. The dark cape-like fur on their backs is tough and hard; Herdier will shelter smaller Pokémon under these capes to protect them from harm. This fur gets both longer and harder as Herdier grow older.","Stoutland have been closely connected with humans for quite some time. In particular, they are often associated with mountain villages, where they are most often found (Stoutland evolving from Herdier are also seen in urban areas, though their thick coats generally mean that they can only thrive in cooler climates). In past decades, travelers to remote mountain villages had reported that every household kept a Stoutland of their own. Their shaggy fur is excellent at retaining heat, allowing them to travel across snow and ice with ease; they are also adapted to cross rugged, rocky terrain. They are very wise and compassionate; in fact, Stoutland are often employed as hiking guides for mountain travelers thanks to their resistance to the cold and affinity for people. They are also known to lead rescue missions during blizzards to find stranded hikers. When they find lost travelers, they will wrap their long fur around them keep them warm. Their fur is so efficient at retaining heat that it is said a person stranded overnight in the snow during the dead of winter would be perfectly fine as long as he or she was wrapped tightly in it. Some parents even trust these gentle Pokémon to watch over their children.","Purrloin are often found in urban areas posing as a stray Pokémon in desperate need of food and water. When compassionate passersby stoop down to help, they will quickly steal their jewelry, wallets, or other valuable items before dashing away. Even when caught, Purrloin have the inexplicable ability to put on ruses of cuteness and cause victims to forgive them without trouble. Many believe Purrloin only steal for fun; unlike Pokémon like Meowth or Murkrow, Purrloin do not hoard what they thieve, and instead toss them away once sufficiently far from their owners. Though they normally stand on four legs, they are also facultative bipeds, much to the surprise of many of their foes. When threatened, Purrloin will act cutely in hopes of tricking their opponent into letting their guards down. Then, they will unsheathe their sharp claws and attack viciously with quick, successive slashes. Despite their negative reputation, however, many people still find Purrloin adorable, making them common pets in many cities. These Pokémon have a rivalry with Nickit in regions where both are found.","While Purrloin dwell in towns and cities, Liepard prefer to stay away from humans, instead living in flat grasslands and savannas. They are known for their beautiful fur, graceful movements, and stealthy hunting. They will always approach prey from behind; their paws are padded with special fur that silences their footsteps. Once Liepard draw close enough, they will use their powerful hind legs to pounce on victims, who often never even see them coming. These Pokémon are nocturnal and have keen eyesight even in the dark to help them see small prey. The spots on their bodies break up their outlines in shady patches of grass, further disguising them. Liepard are adept at climbing trees, spending most of their days resting lazily on branches. Because their fur is so prized for its beauty, it fetches a high price on the black market, where it is sold for use in the fashion industry. Liepard hunting has been outlawed in much of the world, though poaching still remains rampant. How this will affect the species’s numbers remains to be seen. In the wild, Liepard compete with Thievul for territory.","Pansage dwell deep in forests and thick woodlands, especially those in warmer areas. They are friendly Pokémon that often approach strangers; many of them sometimes congregate around travelers. They spend much of their time up in the treetops, though they will wander around the forest floor in search of their favorite food--Berries. Pansage are skilled in locating Berries and are very knowledgeable about their various effects. They are known to share Berries with injured Pokémon and humans, curing ailments like poisoning, paralysis, and burns with the different Berries they have foraged. they will also lead hungry travelers to Berry bushes and thickets where they can find food. The leaves in the small tufts on their heads contain a potent combination of various aromatic compounds that is highly effective at relieving stress and weariness. Pansage may offer one of their leaves to tired travelers after showing them Berry bushes, revitalizing them and allowing them to continue their journeys with renewed vigor.","Unlike the very friendly and docile Pansage, Simisage are highly unpredictable and potentially aggressive. They fearlessly approach those who enter their territories. Though they often harass trespassers by throwing Berries or screeching loudly, they will not attack unless enraged. However, they are erratic and can be set off by seemingly nothing at all; conversely, some travelers have reported that trying to attack Simisage only resulted in the Pokémon becoming amiable and offering food and gifts. They are also prone to sudden mood swings, being cheerful and enthusiastic at one moment and then irate and aggressive the next. Simisage attack by swinging their thorny tails at opponents like clubs. They are also capable of using moves like Seed Bomb. The leaves on their heads are very bitter, but they also contain tremendous amounts of caffeine. People have used these leaves in traditional energy drinks for centuries, steeping them in hot water to extract the caffeine. The bitterness is said to be an acquired taste, however.","Pansear curiously live not only in temperate forests, but also around areas of volcanic activity. Unlike some other volcano-dwelling Fire-type Pokémon, however, Pansear do not only restrict themselves to active or dormant volcanoes; they can also be found on or near the calderas of extinct ones as well, despite their lack of magma. This ability makes extinct volcanoes “hot spots,” so to speak, for Pansear colonies; as other species of Pokémon emigrate to new volcanoes once their current ones die out, Pansear in these areas can take over the abandoned territories and repopulate them. Pansear internally combust their food (mostly Berries) to provide themselves with energy. They are highly intelligent, capable of solving logic puzzles as fast as an average child. They mainly store heat in the tufts of fur on their heads, which can reach temperatures of up to 600°F (300°C). They often cook gathered Berries before consuming them, and are known to skewer them on twigs and roast them over their heads as they search for more food.","Simisear are very enthusiastic Pokémon. They will often approach foreigners entering their territories, holding out handfuls of Berries as peace offerings. Simisear are heavily reliant on sugar to fuel their internal flames; without it, they will become dull and unresponsive. As a result, they tend to consume only the sweetest types of Berries, such as Pecha and Mago Berries. Though generally rare where they live, Simisear are particularly fond of Custap Berries, due to their overwhelming sweetness. In artificial settings, Simisear have been shown to be intelligent enough to grow and harvest their own Berries if provided with the necessary tools and instructions. However, they appear to only be willing to farm their own food if no other options are available; they will let their crops wither as soon as a more available food source appears. Simisear are also fond of candy because of the high sugar content of such treats.  When threatened, Simisear can shake their heads and tails to release clouds of fiery embers that shroud and burn foes.","Panpour can be found in forests near sources of fresh water. Despite being adept swimmers, they spend most of their time on land foraging for Berries. Panpour can store water in the tufts of fur on their heads, allowing them to travel long distances while staying hydrated.  Flexible, hose-like structures run down their backs and through their tails, enabling them to shoot water out of their tails at varying pressures to defend themselves from enemies. In addition to storing water, these tufts also infuse the water they store with nutrients and minerals Panpour obtain from their food. This makes Panpour water very nutritious, particularly for plants. Though Panpour cannot plant their own sources of food (as they seem unable to make the connection between seeds and plants), they are smart enough to learn how to water plants in order to encourage their growth. Plants watered by Panpour grow exceptionally large thanks to the fortified water Panpour spray. In hot weather, Panpour may spray themselves in order to cool down.","Simipour can use their tails to siphon in and spray out water. They store water in the lengthy tufts of fur draping down their heads and can expel it out of their tails with enough force to pulverize concrete. Simipour are very mellow Pokémon that rarely become aggressive towards others. They are often found dwelling near clean, freshwater lakes where they can easily refill their tufts. Like Panpour, Simipour are known to water nearby plants (particularly their food sources, Berry trees) in order to foster their growth. Simipour are very closely related to the similar Simisage and Simisear, sharing physical characteristics as well as Berry-exclusive diets. It is thought that the three species evolved from a single, recent common ancestor that adapted to various different habitats; acrobatic Simisage can harvest Berries growing at high altitudes, hardy Simisear can dwell in extinct volcanic areas even after most other Pokémon have left, and semiaquatic Simipour can support their own food sources near most bodies of fresh water.","Munna feed on the dreams of people and Pokémon alike. They rest in abandoned buildings during the day, cloaking themselves in soporific Dream Mist as protection. At night, they wander about houses in search of sleeping individuals, siphoning their dreams into the holes on their snouts. Their floral patterns light up as they feed. This process is entirely harmless, though these individuals will wake up unable to remember exactly what they dreamt of. Once Munna consume what they can of the dreams, they then process the remaining substance into Dream Mist, a sleep-inducing fog that they use to protect themselves from predators. If the dreams they consumed were pleasant, then the Dream Mist will be bright pink in color and dissipate fairly quickly once released. Munna that siphon nightmares, however, will expel thick, grayish-purple or black mist and will likely become ill. Munna will aid those suffering from bad dreams by shrouding them in Dream Mist; inhalation of the mist will replace bad dreams with whatever dreams the Munna had consumed before. ","Musharna sleep through the day, only becoming active in the moonlight. Even then, they seem to float in states of half-consciousness, with their eyes remaining closed as they wander about. They very much dislike being disturbed from their slumbers. Like Munna, Musharna consume the dreams of people and Pokemon through the holes on their forehead. However, their Dream Mist is far more powerful and concentrated than that of Munna. Gazing closely at their Dream Mist will reveal fragments of the dreams the Musharna had consumed. Depending on the dreams eaten, their mists can take a variety colors, though pink is the most common. Dark, sooty Dream Mist is said to be especially dangerous. When threatened, Musharna can manipulate their Dream Mist to create physical manifestations of the objects, people, and Pokemon within the dreams they had eaten. The figures created are often indistinguishable from real ones. Because of this, Musharna Dream Mist is very valuable on the black market. The illicit capture of Musharna to exploit their mist has become a problem recently, so the species is now protected in most regions. ","Pidove are absurdly common Pokémon in most urban areas, found in or on nearly every park or building in large cities. They are often found in large, cooing flocks perched on telephone wires or tree branches. Pidove are used to the presence of humans, not even flinching when approached by people. In many areas, they have even become accustomed to being fed breadcrumbs by passerby. Though very loyal and compliant to their trainers, Pidove are not very intelligent. They will always obey commands, but have trouble remembering exactly what they were told to do for more than a few minutes. Pidove has been known to fly off to fetch items only to return less than a minute later empty-handed, having forgotten what they were searching for. In spite of their forgetfulness, Pidove have the uncanny ability to always find their way back to their nests, no matter how far or long they have flown. It is believed that these Pokémon can retain visual details far better than aural information, allowing them to navigate home unerringly despite not being able to remember spoken commands for extended periods of time.","Unlike Pidove, Tranquill prefer to dwell in solitary, quiet areas away from others. They are docile Pokémon that tend to keep to themselves; however, they known to attack viciously when bothered. Tranquill normally are found deep in forests, though some make their homes in secluded sections of city parks and gardens. While their pre-evolutions are known for their noisy coos, Tranquill rarely make much sound at all, except for a peculiar cross between a coo and a cluck during mating season. Even when trained, Tranquill prefer solitude over company. If given the chance, they will spend most of their time alone in quiet places. However, they are fiercely loyal to their trainers; they are always able to find their way back to them even if they have travelled considerably far since the last time they were together. Their uncanny senses of direction make them a popular partner for delivery workers. Tranquill are better at walking than most other avian Pokémon, and are capable of sprinting across flat terrain for short distances. They can still fly, however, though they must land to rest periodically while doing so.","Unfezant sport one of the more striking examples of sexual dimorphism in the Pokémon world. While female Unfezant are drably colored in black, gray, and brown, males are adorned with bright pink “masks” and vivid green splotches on their undersides. During mating season, females tend to choose mates with the brightest-colored masks and the longest tassels; consequently male Unfezant will fight viciously to become the most “desirable”, tearing off parts of their opponents’ tassels or sullying their masks with dirt and debris. Male Unfezant will also swing their heads wildly in order to both threaten opponents and attract mates, as the action makes their tassels appear longer. These adornments are cumbersome for flight, so females tend to be better long-distance fliers than males. Stronger wings allow males to fly faster over short distances, however. Both genders are equally adept at running, perhaps even more so than flying. Like Pidove and Tranquill, Unfezant are fiercely loyal to their trainers, refusing to become close with anyone (including potential mates, unless explicitly given permission) other than them. Female Unfezant tend to take longer to warm up to strangers, while males are more outgoing from the start. Unfezant are known for their great pride and sharp wit, a far cry from simple Pidove.","Blitzle can be found in small herds of roughly two dozen members on dry plains and savannas. They are especially common during thunderstorms, when large numbers of them congregate out in the open to absorb discharged electricity. The tips of the manes on their heads act as lightning rods, directing lightning to themselves and storing it for later use. Blitzle flash their manes with varying frequencies, rhythms, and intensities to communicate with others. When threatened, they can discharge large amounts of electricity at once in bright flashes of light, giving them time to dash away while foes are blinded. Blitzle have no way of generating their own electricity, however, so they rely largely on the weather to charge up. Because of this, Blitzle rarely use their electricity for anything other than communication unless the situation is absolutely dire. Scientists believe that their black bodies and white stripes help them avoid predators—when many Blitzle stand in a group, it becomes difficult to distinguish one from another due to their blending patterns.","Zebstrika are temperamental and unpredictable Pokémon. Like Blitzle, they can be found in herds averaging about 20 or so members. They can harness electricity from a variety of sources, including the atmosphere, friction, and lightning bolts during thunderstorms. Zebstrika are easily angered and will charge at full gallop at anything they perceive as threats. Once a single Zebstrika in a herd charges, the rest of the herd charges as well, leading to a stampede within a matter of seconds. As Zebstrika run, their manes begin discharging bolts of electricity in all directions, stunning everything nearby. The sound of a Zebstrika galloping at full speed is akin to a thunder clap, while a herd of them makes the ground reverberate as if a tremendous storm is approaching. Zebstrika, like their pre-evolutions, communicate by flashing their manes in a variety of patterns, though their stripes can now light up and flash as well. They often attack with little regard for their own safety, utilizing moves like Wild Charge that not only damage foes, but themselves as well.","Roggenrola were discovered relatively recently when an earthquake fissure revealed a cave where many of them were congregated. They require immense pressure in order to develop properly, so they are almost exclusively found deep within the earth. The crushing pressure of the underground allows them to develop dense bodies as hard as steel, with mysterious “energy cores” that—obviously—seem to provide them with energy. Their bodies are made up of compressed sediment dated to be hundreds of years old. Occasionally, older Roggenrola may make their way to deep caves closer to the surface, perhaps out of curiosity. They must return back into the earth, though, as their cores require pressure to run. The holes on their bodies are not eyes, but actually ears. They allow Roggenrola to hear sounds that reverberate in the rocks around them, alerting them to potential dangers like running water, which can cool their cores and erode their bodies; a long soak can even leave them soft and vulnerable for weeks. They follow sounds intently, toppling over from surprise if they stop abruptly. These ears also connect to and vent their energy cores, and these Pokémon will get quite angry if these orifices are messed with. Roggenrola seem to enjoy comparing body hardness with Pokémon like Carbink.","Once a Roggenrola’s core has sufficiently developed, it will evolve into a Boldore. Boldore still spend most of their time deep below, but they can now spend extended periods of time in caves near the surface thanks to improved core stability. The orange crystals jutting from their bodies are in fact hardened growths of their cores, which sometimes leak from cracks in their forms when they store too much energy. These outgrowths are signs of healthy Boldore, as they signal a surplus of energy. A single crystal holds enough energy to fuel 100 trucks; for this reason, they are quite valuable in the energy industry. These orange growths are also harder than diamond. Boldore cannot turn, so they scuttle back and forth or left and right. They use their ears to detect echoes and vibrations around them. Unlike Roggenrola, Boldore use their ears to find rather than avoid water; since their radioactive cores are now much stronger, they are also more prone to overheating. For this reason, Boldore must occasionally drink water cool themselves down to prevent potential meltdowns, though they still dislike getting their exteriors wet. Though Boldore are not yet specifically protected by any official legislation, increased pressure on Boldore populations due to their energy-rich crystals has led to many conservation efforts arising in multiple regions. These Pokémon are easily spooked and will charge straight forwards towards unfamiliar sounds. ​When a Boldore's crystals begin to glow, it is preparing to launch an energy attack.","With immense pressure and a sudden surge of energy, a Boldore can rarely evolve into a Gigalith. Though they spend most of their time deep underground, Gigalith will make their way to the surface to bask in the sun’s rays. The crystals on their bodies can convert sunlight into energy in their radioactive cores, allowing them to effectively survive off of nothing but the sun. Studies of how they store, release, and convert light energy have given way to commodities such as phosphorescent paint and clothing. Gigalith can also fire stored light from their mouths in devastating balls of energy capable of leveling mountains. They are often used in construction to demolish buildings. If they do not sunbathe for too long, however, they become unable to attack. Despite their destructive potential, Gigalith are peaceful Pokémon, as their nigh-indestructible bodies keep them safe without the need to retaliate. Additionally, when Gigalith fire off particularly powerful attacks, they in fact crack their bodies with thousands of tiny fissures from the recoil, and must hide themselves away until they recover. Scientists are currently researching their radioactive cores, particularly on how they can retain such power will little, if any, ill effects. Thanks to their sturdy bodies, Gigalith are a popularly employed in construction and mining alongside the likes of Copperajah.","Woobat have very poor eyesight; shaggy fur covers their near-useless eyes as a result. Instead of sight, Woobat rely on echolocation to find their way around. Curiously, they emit ultrasonic waves from their noses rather than their mouths, as they have sound-producing organs used exclusively for echolocation located within their heart-shaped nostrils. Woobat roost by attaching their noses to the walls of caves, using their nostrils as suction cups. When they fly away, they leave behind distinctive heart-shaped marks on walls. Some people believe that having a Woobat land on one’s body and leave a mark on the skin is a sign of good fortune, especially for one’s romantic life. Woobat are friendly Pokémon, and curious ones as well. Many of them can be seen flitting around spelunkers that enter their caverns, probing the travelers with their sound waves and noses. During mating season, Woobat engage in complex mating rituals that involve “kissing” noses with each other and flying around in a variety of intricate, interlocking aerial patterns.","Swoobat have sound-producing organs in their noses that can produce a large range of frequencies. Depending on the situation, they can alter the pitch and volume of their sound waves to achieve a variety of effects. Most of the time, these Pokémon use their waves to navigate; however, when threatened, they can instead produce frequencies capable of pulverizing stone and concrete. Releasing such strong sound pulses tires them out quickly, however, rendering them temporarily unable to fly. By shaking their tails vigorously, they can further increase the power of their waves. Despite their destructive potential, however, Swoobat rarely ever need to resort to using such attacks. They are very friendly Pokémon that are almost always found in pairs. Recently, researchers have discovered that the ultrasonic waves emitted by idle male Swoobat while courting (which they are almost always in the process of doing) have a positive effect on the moods of both people and Pokémon. In battle, Swoobat are known to use their innocent demeanors to their advantages, using their suction cup-like noses to attack foes with Heart Stamp while their guards are lowered.","Drilbur can be found in areas with temperate climates and solid, dry ground. They spend most of their time in underground caves and tunnels, primarily surfacing to supplement their diets with fruits and plant matter (they usually consume insects and other small invertebrates found in the dirt). Despite being mostly solitary, Drilbur tend to be very friendly towards other Pokémon and humans. They sometimes develop mutualistic relationships with people in suburban and rural areas, plowing backyard gardens and orchards in exchange for fruits and Berries. However, unruly Drilbur can easily damage entire fields of crops by tearing carelessly through plant roots, so trained individuals are heavily preferred for agricultural purposes. Drilbur burrow by clasping their claws together over their heads and rotating about at high speeds like drills. They can spin as fast as 30 mph (50 km/h) in this manner, nearly as speedy as an average car on a city road. Drilbur build their nests underground, constructing many tunnels passing through them for travel and ventilation. They leaves distinctive mounds of dirt on the surface directly above their nests to help them find their way back home.","Excadrill are rather territorial Pokémon, attacking intruders that enter their tunnels on sight. Known as \"Drill Kings,\" they dwell deeper in the earth than Drilbur and constructs longer, more complex networks of tunnels as well. Individuals have been found living more than 300 feet (91 meters) below the earth’s surface. By straightening out their bodies and clasping their claws and blades together in cone-like shapes, they can spin around rapidly to dig through the earth like drills at speeds reaching 90 mph (145 km/h); their burrowing is powerful enough to cut through iron plates. Excadrill intentionally construct maze-like tunnel networks that only they can navigate. Prey that stumble into their tunnels become lost in the labyrinths, allowing Excadrill to easily capture and drag them back to their nest in the hearts of these mazes. The burrowing of these Pokémon is beneficial for crop growth, as they till soil far more efficiently than most human processes. However, they are also known to cause severe damage to subway networks, drilling through steel wires and tunnels with ease.","Audino have one of the most acute senses of hearing in the Pokémon world. By touching the feelers on their ears to objects, these Pokémon can pick up even the smallest sound waves; because of this, Audino are common sights in hospitals and Pokémon Centers, where they are trained to use their feelers as stethoscopes to detect irregularities in the heartbeats of patients. Their hearing is so advanced that they can also use their feelers to assess other aspects of an individual’s health, including blood pressure, breathing, and digestion. Some Pokémon breeders and daycare centers also employ Audino to assess Pokémon eggs and determine when they will most likely hatch. Even without using their feelers, their hearing is still superb, being as sensitive as many artificial radars. Audino are rarely seen in the wild, as they are shy Pokémon that retreat and hide when they hear someone approaching—considering their extraordinary aural abilities, this means that they almost always are hiding from potential enemies.","Timburr are common sights in towns and cities, often seen working on construction sites alongside human builders. In the wild, Timburr are usually found in forests and wooded mountains. They use their strength to break down trees into more manageable planks and logs, which they in turn use to construct temporary shelters. Timburr are constantly looking for ways to improve the strength and stability of their homes. Every morning, they tear down the homes they built the day before to salvage materials for constructing new shelters, experimenting with different techniques and designs. This often leads to the creation of very strange-looking shelters, some of which are stable and some of which are not. It is said that these Pokémon enjoy building so much that they throw tantrums when unexpected rain halts their projects for the day. When Timburr are capable of lifting whole logs three times their size without having to splinter them into smaller pieces, they are close to evolution. Wild Timburr are known to visit human cities to examine the architecture of urban buildings; they will later attempt to imitate the designs they see in their own structures.","Upon evolution, Gurdurr begin to use a wider variety of materials in their constructions, including scrap metal and iron they find near human settlements and mountains. Like Timburr, Gurdurr are often seen near construction sites helping workers build; in fact, they seem to prefer working alongside humans to working alone, possibly because of the plentiful resources they gain access to by doing so. These Pokémon are often seen carrying steel beams as signs of strength, though they will carry just about anything heavy to display their power. When not building, Gurdurr will hold their beams over their heads in order to work on their strength and endurance. Their bodies are so sturdy that it is said a group of pro wrestlers pushing on them would not even make them budge. When tearing down buildings, Gurdurr will swing their heavy beams to pulverize them, often rendering the remains unsalvageable in the process. They are generally more suited at destruction rather than construction, though they perform their demolitions with skill and pride. Groups of Gurdurr and Machoke can sometimes be seen comparing their muscles with each other; \"losers\" will drop out of future comparisons in favor of additional training.","Conkeldurr are rarities in the wild; only the strongest, oldest Gurdurr can evolve into them. It is believed that Conkeldurr learned how to make concrete long ago in order to construct stronger structures, and taught the skill to humans about 2,000 years ago. Even today, an average Conkeldurr can mix a stronger concrete from natural materials than modern commercial brands. Their upper bodies are so massive that they have trouble staying upright, relying on their concrete pillars to stand up. Despite this, Conkeldurr are incredibly powerful and sturdy. In addition to their strength, they are also very knowledgeable in the fields of building and architecture. These Pokémon are employed at construction sites not to build, but rather to supervise and assess the stability and integrity of structures. In combat, instead of relying on brute force to overpower opponents, Conkeldurr spin their pillars at high speeds and smash them into opponents; the centrifugal force of the pillars enables them to strike with immense power. Conkeldurr can also swing their pillars about freely to attack, though doing so may occasionally cause them to lose balance. In dire situations, they will throw their pillars aside to pummel their foes with their fists, though they have great difficulty remaining upright while doing so.","Tympole live in large groups known as “circles.” The growths on either side of their heads can vibrate quickly in order to produce ultrasonic waves. These waves, though imperceptible to humans, are how Tympole communicate with one another. When threatened, a Tympole will emit a distinctive pattern and frequency of sound that only other Tympole can hear; once the rest of the circle hears the warning, they will all begin to produce the same sound. The circle will then, as a group, adjust the frequency of the sound waves they are emitting until they become audible at an earsplitting pitch to attackers. In battle, this tactic manifests as the move Round. Curiously if a single Tympole is isolated and put under stress, it will emit an initial warning sound as usual, but will not attempt to stun the opponent with a subsequent deafening pitch, instead only holding the first note. This seems to indicate that Tympole will not attack until their warning calls are “confirmed” by allies, which occurs when other Tympole replicate the starting pitch. Resonating ripples on the surface of a pond are a sure sign of a Tympole circle singing below.","Palpitoad live in groups of anywhere from six to twelve members. They are amphibious Pokémon, capable of dwelling both on dry land and in fresh water. They cannot stray far from the water’s edge, however, as they must keep their skin moist in order to breathe properly (as they essentially breathes through their thin skin). Because they lack arms, Palpitoad rely primarily on their tails for balance. They use their long, sticky tongues to catch flying insects in midair; their saliva contains a substance that paralyzes prey on contact. By vibrating the bumps around their bodies, they can create small tremors on land or ripples in water; this helps scare out prey for them to catch. In the evening during mating season, groups of Palpitoad are often found perched on rocks near the shore. They can be heard executing complex rhythms as a part of their mating rituals by vibrating their circular growths in various patterns. At the end of these songs, the individuals that created the most beautiful rhythms are the most likely to be chosen as mates. Palpitoad with larger bumps can produce a greater range of pitches, thus giving them an advantage in song composition. A few trained Palpitoad have even been able to compose songs aimed to please human listeners.","Seismitoad are solitary Pokémon; they are generally not very territorial or aggressive, however. This is because they rarely need to actively defend themselves from foes, as most are wise enough to avoid angering them. By vibrating the circular growths around their bodies, Seismitoad can create earthquakes while on land and large waves while in the water. Additionally, by vibrating the bumps on their hands, they can deliver powerful punches that send shockwaves through the bodies of foes. Such attacks have the ability to pulverize boulders. Even when idle, Seismitoad generate minute, barely-palpable vibrations beneath them that can cause dizziness and nausea in those nearby. In some regions, trained Seismitoad work as masseuses for the elderly, using their vibrating lumps to work out muscle soreness. The bumps on their heads can also shoot out a paralyzing substance; research shows that the compound is a more potent version of that found Palpitoad’s numbing saliva. Because their bodies are also coated in a thin layer of the same substance, touching a Seismitoad’s skin will also induce a similar effect; people sometimes use this compound in mild doses as a hallucinogen.","Throh are masters of the martial art known as judo. In particular, they are skilled at subduing foes in chokeholds and throwing them with great strength. Throh always travel in packs of exactly five. In the wild, they will tie sturdy vines around their waists as belt; trained Throh often use strips of cloth or actual belts instead. Throh can tighten their belts to become sturdier and stronger. As they train, they search for more resilient vines that can withstand their strength; A Throh will gauge another’s power based on the toughness of its belt, which grows darker over time as it absorbs its owner's sweat. Their primary method of defending themselves is to grab hold of threats and throw them as far away as possible. If enemies are too far away to grasp, these Pokémon are also known to chuck heavy objects like logs and boulders at them from a distance to scare them away. In battle, Throh can pull off rare Fighting-type techniques such as Storm Throw in order to overpower foes. They will usually wait for their opponents to try and attack them first before retaliating with defensive counterattacks. A Throh that cannot keep up with its pack's training will discard its belt and banish itself to train in solitude; the pack will then search for a new Throh to take its place.","Sawk live alone in secluded areas away from both other Pokémon and humans. They are experts in the martial art of karate. Sawk train relentlessly far up in mountains and deep in forests with the desire to perfect “flawless” karate chops. They will often go days without food or sleep during their brutal training. People living near the feet of mountains often report hearing distant thumping sounds in the middle of the night; oftentimes, they are the sounds of Sawk training their chops and kicks on tree trunks and boulders. Because their training requires such intense concentration, Sawk will become very angry if they are bothered during their practice. They may even retaliate by using Karate Chop if they are sufficiently irked. By tightening the belts around their waists, Sawk can increase the power of their blows. Sawk periodically replace their belts, which are usually made from sturdy vines that they find in the wild, as they get stronger. Because of this, the a Sawk’s strength can be discerned from the quality of its belt. According to folklore, Sawk strive to one be able to perform a karate chop so perfect that it is able to cleave the ocean itself in two.","Sewaddle live in thick, temperate forests with their families. They spend their time munching idly on the leaves of plants. They can spit durable silk from their mouths, which they use to bind chewed-up leaves into protective layers of “clothing” around their bodies. When Sewaddle are born, their mother Leavanny tailor their first outfits in order to keep them warm and protected. As Sewaddle grow, they periodically shed their clothing and sews new sets on their own, though their mothers will aid in proportioning and tailoring their outfits. The leafy hoods surrounding their heads make it difficult for predators to detect them. When they sense danger, they will wrap their hoods around themselves to hide from threats. The hoods also serve as emergency food sources for them if they become hungry; many Sewaddle have holes in their hoods for this reason, having nibbled at them while famished. Because of how Sewaddle fashion their own clothing out of leaves, they have become popular mascots for many designers and some brands in the clothing industry.","Swadloon spend the majority of their time on the forest floor under the shade of thick canopies, though they rarely stray far away from their mothers. Like Sewaddle, Swadloon construct their own clothing out of leaves. To keep warm on cold forest floors, these Pokémon sew together cloaks that help protect them from rain, wind, and even predators. They also help shield Swadloon from direct sunlight, as these Pokémon prefer to remain in dark, damp areas. Unlike some other mid-stage Bug-type Pokémon like Metapod, Cascoon, and Spewpa, Swadloon are restless—they are almost always on the move. As Swadloon travel, they feed on dead leaves beneath them on forest floors. In their natural ecosystems, Swadloon often serve integral roles as decomposers, turning dead plant matter into nutrients that nurture new trees and plants. In a perpetual symbiotic relationship with the local flora, Swadloon gather fresh leaves to protect themselves from outside conditions while in turn composting dead leaves into fertilizer for plant life.","Where Sewaddle and Swadloon can be found, Leavanny can almost inevitably be seen as well. Leavanny have very strong senses of parental responsibility, raising their children until they themselves evolve. The cutters on their arms are razor-sharp; they are used to tailor leaves into protective clothing for themselves and their children. When threatened, however, Leavanny will use these blades to defend their families with attacks like Leaf Blade and X-Scissor. Leavanny can produce sticky silk from their mouths that they use to bind leaves together while sewing. When they reproduce, they wrap each of their eggs in a cozy leafy covering. They use the warmth of dead, fermenting leaves to incubate their eggs. Their parental instincts are so strong, in fact, that they will gladly take in lost and orphaned Pokémon as their own, sewing them new clothing from leaves and providing them with some of the food they had gathered for their own children. Some urban legends even tell tales of human children lost in the woods being raised to adulthood by friendly Leavanny.","Venipede use their antennae to navigate around the forest floor. Their feelers are very sensitive, capable of detecting minute changes in the air currents around them. Venipede use this skill when hunting, sensing vibrations in the air to hone in on fleeing prey. Despite their compact bodies, Venipede are surprisingly fast. They are aggressive, territorial Pokémon that will attack travelers in their domains on sight. Additionally, their bites inject a moderate venom strong enough to completely paralyze larger avian Pokémon, or at least numb the muscles of people around the point of injection. Unlike other poisonous species that attempt to conserve their venoms and toxins, Venipede do not hesitate at all to bite and envenom both prey and predators--in fact, they use their toxicity as their primary method of offense. Their combination of speed, venom, aggressiveness, and general abundance in the dark undergrowth of forests make Venipede one of the most common causes of wild Pokémon-related hospitalizations in the world.","Like Venipede, Whirlipede are fast, aggressive, and venomous. They can easily bruise and cut those who anger them—an easy task, considering their hostility. Instead of biting, Whirlipede inject their poison through the various spikes and barbs on their bodies. They attack by rolling like tires at high speeds into foes, not only knocking them back but also leaving bruises and multiple scratches with their toxic spikes as well. Whirlipede do not eat, relying on the energy they had stored as Venipede for survival. In order to conserve this energy, these Pokémon will remain completely still until they are threatened; they are rarely ever attacked intentionally due to their venomous spikes, so they do not have to actively defend themselves often. As a consequence of their motionlessness, however, most travelers are unaware of their presences; this is only exacerbated by the fact that they often hide themselves in dense piles of leaves or bushes. For this reason, most Whirlipede attacks occur seemingly out of nowhere without any warning whatsoever.","Few Bug-type Pokemon are more feared than Scolipede. Scolipede are stronger, faster, more aggressive, and more poisonous than their pre-evolutions, who were already considered dangerous to begin with. Luckily, because of their extremely territorial natures, sighting a Scolipede in the wild is rather rare. These Pokemon are apex predators, chasing down avian and mammalian prey at speeds rivaling that of automobiles. When they near their quarries, they will jabs them repeatedly with the sharp horns on their heads, aiming to gore them enough so that they can catch up. When Scolipede reach their victims, they will grasp their necks with their (oddly short) front claws, injecting a fatal poison that will kill within minutes. Despite this, Scolipede have been known to begin feeding on their prey before they have actually died.When two Scolipede meet, they will battle fiercely using their horns to headbutt each other into submission. The winner gains control of the territory of both individuals, while the loser, if still alive, must relocate to a different area of the forest.","Cottonee travel in large groups on light forest breezes. Though rather weak on their own, these Pokémon finds strength in numbers. They float in elusive, cloud-like bunches with other Cottonee, keeping out of reach from most attackers. If isolated, they may become very nervous and frantic; they seems to be calmed, however, by the texture of cotton fabric. This is likely because the feeling of such cloth mimics that of the other Cottonee. If attacked, Cottonee will shoot out puffs of cotton from their bodies. These puffs act as decoys to confuse predators, giving them time escape. In larger quantities, these puffs also irritate the eyes and noses of attackers as well as hinder their movement. The puffs can be harvested and stuffed into pillows, or turned into fabric for clothing. Cottonee can also regrow it quickly, making it an abundant resource in woodland areas. These Pokémon cannot float well in the rain, as their bodies become too heavy to be carried by the wind when waterlogged. Consequently, when groups of Cottonee sense approaching storms, they will all attempt to cluster under large trees—oftentimes all together under the same one—in order to stay dry. In the Galar region, Cottonee fiber is weaved together with Eldegoss fiber in order to produce a composite textile that is stronger than either alone.","Whimsicott are notorious for their mischievous personalities. They conceal themselves in chaotic whirlwinds, riding gusts aimlessly as they travel about; they rarely stay in one spot for long. Whimsicott cause mischief wherever they travel. In the wild, this often entails summoning winds to strip rows of trees of their leaves or divert the flows of rivers. In houses and buildings, this may mean rearranging furniture with gusts or leaving thin layers of dust blown in from outside on every surface. Wherever Whimsicott cause trouble, however, they alway leave a telltale sign—cotton puffs. Handfuls of them can inevitably be found wherever they go, having been shed from their bodies. Especially strong winds may strip their whole heads of cotton. Their soft compositions enable them to squeeze and slip through even the tiniest of gaps; this lets them to infiltrate and cause mischief in virtually any building. Despite their fondness for trickery, however, Whimsicott rarely ever mean to intentionally cause harm; in fact, they will actively intervene in their own pranks if they believe that someone will be hurt. Whimsicott will constantly grow more cotton as long as they remain exposed to sunlight, and thus must groom themselves regularly by pruning off the excess and scattering it to the wind.","Petilil thrive in areas with moist, fertile soil. Consequently, places where they are abundant tend to be ideal for growing crops as well. For centuries, farmers used the size of Petilil populations to assess the value of land for agriculture. If the soil quality in an area worsens, the Petilil of the area will group up and migrate to a new patch of land. Due to their specific needs regarding soil fertility and plant life, however, the conversion of their natural habitats into farmland has also had devastating effects on their numbers. Many regions now protect the richly-soiled areas that wild Petilil call home in efforts to preserve the rapidly-declining species. The leaves on their heads serve as their sole method of defense; when attacked, Petilil will flee and shed these leaves as decoys for predators to eat instead, as they will grow back within a day. Petilil that shed frequently tend to be plumper. These leaves are exceptionally bitter, so most foes that taste them will learn to avoid attacking them in the future. Despite their bracing acerbity, though, Petilil leaves are reputed to be very rejuvenating for tired or nauseous people. They are often sold by herbalists as natural remedies for fatigue, and are particularly popular among the elderly.","Lilligant are rarely seen in the wild, as they evolve with Sun Stones and are only found in areas with exceptionally rich soil. They are most famous for the beautiful flowers on their heads; most of the time, they remain closed. They bloom under extremely particular conditions that, even today, researchers have trouble pinpointing; some postulate that the exact conditions may even vary between individuals.  It is said that it takes an incredibly skilled and dedicated trainer to coax one to bloom. Upon blossoming, though, they release one of the sweetest fragrances known to man; Lilligant are highly coveted in the practice of aromatherapy for this reason. Individuals each have their own distinct scent based on the soil in which they were raised. Neglecting Lilligant, however, may cause their flowers to wilt. These flowers help them attract mates and will also wither once one is found. They will also quickly dry up and rot if Liiligant are not properly cared for. Lilligant are mesmerizing dancers, spending much of their time dancing in the wild. In battle, they can perform moves like Teeter Dance, Petal Dance, and even Quiver Dance. Perhaps because of their grace and beauty, Lilligant are also popular Pokémon amongst celebrities.​","Basculin appear in two different variants, one with red stripes across their bodies and another with blue stripes. The two types have other, subtler, differences as well, such as the colors and shapes of their eyes and fins, so most scientists classify each form as a separate subspecies. Regardless of color, Basculin are particularly hostile Pokémon that will attack anything foreign in their waters, earning them the names \"thugs of the lake.\" Schools of Basculin are almost always made up of individuals of the same form (with a few, rare exceptions), and will viciously attack schools of the other color with their strong jaws. Consequently, most bodies of water where Basculin dwell will have an overwhelming majority of one form, with most individuals of the opposite color having been killed off. They are also generally hostile to other species, albeit not to the same degree as to rival Basculin (and even-more hostile Carvanha). Still, they usually are aggressive enough to drive off all Pokémon other than Corphish and Crawdaunt. Basculin appear to differentiate threats from allies by color; red Basculin will attack anything blue, while blue ones will attack anything red. Their flesh is widely regarded to be very tasty, so they are popular catches for many fishermen. However, there is much dispute as to whether red- or blue-striped Basculin are more delicious. Red-striped Basculin tend to be more fatty and popular with younger people, while Blue-striped Basculin tend to be leaner and popular with older diners. Despite their hostility, Basculin are a key food source for many freshwater predators. They are also popular amongst anglers for putting up a fight when fishing, leading to their illegal introduction into numerous fishing lakes around the world.","Sandile dwell in arid and sandy deserts. They spend most of their time submerged in the sand, leaving only their nostrils and eyes above the surface. Because Sandile are cold-blooded, they rely on the outside environment to regulate their body temperatures. During the sweltering heat of the daytime, staying buried in the sand keeps them cool. At night, however, when temperatures drop drastically, these Pokémon rely on the heat retained in the sand from the daytime to stay warm. Sandile also have dark membranes over their eyes; not only do they protect them from blowing sand, but they also shield their eyes from the intense light of the desert sun, absorbing its ultraviolet rays. Though Sandile are predators, desert scarcity and their small stature often leaves them with little choice but scavenging. They are ubiquitous in this role and are sometimes known as the \"cleaners of the desert.\" Sandile are known to be inquisitive towards human travelers, often walking beneath them or tearing holes in their bags to examine their contents. However, they rarely mean any harm, and may even befriend trekkers if they enjoy their presence. Though normally solitary, Sandile seem to instinctually protect others of their kind if they see any of them being threatened. In warm weather, they may occasionally venture out of their desert homes, though this is a rare occurrence.","When Sandile evolve into Krokorok, they seek out groups of five to seven members for aid in hunting and protection. These groups are led by females, who delegate hunting to males. They are nocturnal predators, though they are known to wander about during the day as well if they have not eaten for a while. As reptiles, though, they despise the cold, and will bury deep into the desert sand (where the day's heat is retained) on particularly chilly nights instead of hunting. The black membranes covering their eyes develop a new function upon evolution; not only do they protect them from sandstorms and light (though because they are rarely active in the day this is hardly ever a factor), but they also grant Krokorok with infrared vision. This makes them superb hunters, even in the darkness of desert nights, as they can detect prey by their infrared signatures rather than by sight alone. Using their heat-sensitive eyes to locate unwary victims, packs can easily surround and corner their prey before their targets even notice. They will bury extra food in the sand as an emergency cache in case they fail to hunt down a meal in the future. Because their masks vaguely resemble those of criminals, Krokorok are often portrayed as malicious in popular culture. In reality, though, Krokorok are not particularly sinister Pokémon despite how they are often depicted."," Krookodile have specialized black membranes over their eyes that shield them from sun and sand and grant them with infrared vision. In addition to these features, however, these membranes now also allow Krookodile to zoom in and out on objects up to 30 miles (50 km) away as if they was looking through pairs of binoculars, allowing them to see amazingly far into the distance. These Pokémon are known to be very aggressive and territorial; unlike Krokorok, Krookodile are solitary hunters that are active both during the day and at night. They can swim through sand as if it was water and sneak up on their victims. Then, they jump out and crunch their prey with their powerful jaws, which are strong enough to crush automobiles. Krookodile have a instinctively bite down on anything moving in front of them, no matter what size or shape. Once they chomp down on something, they will not let go until their victim appears unconscious; they will twist their heads violently to tear prey in half. Because of this, the best course of action when confronted by a Krookodile is to remain totally still, as these Pokémon tend to ignore things that are not in motion. It has recently been discovered that some Krookodile will in fact pair up with a lone Flygon when hunting; the Flygon will create a sandstorm to provide the Krookodile with cover, allowing the Krookodile ambushes the prey more effectively. The two then split the catch evenly.","Darumaka primarily dwell in arid deserts. During the day, these Pokémon are extremely hyperactive; the fires burning within their bodies keep them constantly running about. At night, however, their temperaments change suddenly. When Darumaka sleep, their internal fires cool down (relatively, as they still can reach temperatures of 1,100°F, or 600°C) and they withdraw their limbs into their bodies, rocking back and forth slightly in this state. They sleep in upright positions, with the majority of their masses located near their bottoms. This makes them nearly impossible to knock over, no matter how hard they are pushed or pulled. Oddly, sleeping Darumaka were once found congregating near the ruins of an ancient desert civilization, having been asleep for an unknown amount of time. Upon awakening, the creatures appeared dazed for a while, but were otherwise completely healthy. Because of their high internal body temperatures, their droppings are very hot. Nomads used to hold Darumaka dung in their pockets to keep warm during cold desert nights. These Pokémon were thought to be symbols of good luck in ancient times.","Most of the time, Darmanitan are absolutely bursting with energy. With internal fires burning at 2,500ºF (1,371ºC), they can hardly remain still for even a second. Their boundless energy also grants them impressive power in battle, increasing with their internal temperatures; they can crushing dump trucks with a single punch. When weakened, however, their bodies activate a survival mechanism that causes them to harden into a stone-like material. In this form, known as Zen Mode, Darmanitan become far more bulky and durable, though they are also rendered completely immobile as a result. Zen Mode Darmanitan are adept at meditation; they don’t need to eat or drink. However, their physical attacks are far weaker than when in Standard Mode; leading them to rely on their durability and mental strength to defeat foes. Many Zen Mode Darmanitan have been found buried in ancient desert ruins, dated to be as old as the structures themselves. It is believed that these Pokémon once served as guards of these ancient societies, entering Zen Mode as they awaited their next orders that would never arrive.","Maractus are commonly found in groups of anywhere from a dozen to two dozen in dry, sandy regions. They can survive on remarkably little water for Grass-type Pokémon, letting them to tolerate the aridity of barren deserts. Though they are capable of moving, Maractus remain rooted in place for the majority of the day in order to conserve as much energy as possible. They are a diurnal species that cease all movement once the sun sets. The spikes growing out of their bodies help deter predators from attacking them; however, their large size makes it easy for smaller, more agile creatures (like young avian Pokémon) to avoid their thorns and feast on their seeds. To deter this, Maractus rhythmically shake their partly-hollow bodies to rattle about the dry seeds stored within. This creates maraca-like sounds that startle such Pokémon away. The upbeat, rhythmic sounds of groups of Maractus “dancing” is thought to have heavily influenced the music of native desert cultures. When it rains, Maractus will gorge themselves on water to last until the next distant rainfall. Once a year, Maractus will all scatter their seeds at once, serving as a vital (if fleeting) food source in barren deserts.","When first born, Dwebble have no shells on their thin and fragile bodies. Their first instinct is to scramble about in search of adequate rocks, which they meticulously inspect for imperfections and weaknesses. When Dwebble find ideal stones, they will secrete a highly corrosive acid from their mouths onto the rocks, dissolving holes large enough for their bodies to fit into; they often make enemies of Geodude, Roggenrola, and Rolycoly by trying to dissolve them by mistake. Dwebble rely on their rocky shells for protection from predators, tucking themselves into them when threatened. Their hooklike tails latch onto crags within their rocks, making it difficult to dislodge their shells without great force. If their rocks break, Dwebble will become very agitated and not sleep or eat until they find new shells. In captivity, they have been known to use materials other than stone in order to construct their shells, including brick, asphalt, and concrete. However, most Dwebble prefer using rocks regardless of what other substances are closer or more abundant, perhaps because of the differing weights and densities of the materials. In deserts, shell-less Dwebble often make their homes in the pores of Hippowdon, cleaning out stuck rocks while searching for new abodes.","Like Dwebble, Crustle are almost never found without their shells. Their sturdy legs allow them to support enormous amounts of weight on their backs, letting them carry large blocks of stone nearly indefinitely. Crustle are able to survive for long periods of time without water, which is often scarce in their arid habitats. In fact, they dislike direct contact with the substance, retreating beneath their shells during even light rains. To fashion their shells, Crustle will carve blocks of dirt and stone from the solid earth directly beneath their feet. They are highly territorial and will compete with nearby Crustle for control of choice swathes of land. When fighting for territory, Crustle will attempt to shatter the shells of their opponents. Competitors with broken shells relinquish all of their land; they also become timid and weak, as they are unable to defend themselves until they can build new shells. Because Crustle carve their shells from the ground within their domains, Crustle from different areas will often sport rocks with differently-colored strata. Crustle appear to be able to distinguish foreign and native visitors from each other based on these alternately-colored layers. Though they dislike confrontation, their claws are strong enough to crack a Rhyperior's carapace, and they will wield them fiercely if they feel their shells are threatened.","Scraggy live in small gangs of up to a dozen members. They prowl around arid habitats in search of scarce food and water. Their most notable feature is the baggy skin around their waists; as Scraggy grow, they periodically shed their skins, as many other reptilian Pokémon do. Scraggy, however, do not discard their old skins. Instead, they allow them to hang around their waists. The intense heat of the desert sun dries the skins so that they are elastic, leather-like, and surprisingly resilient. When threatened, Scraggy will pull their skins up over their heads to protect themselves. Scraggy with baggier skin garner more respect amongst their peers. It is thought that Scraggy evolve once their skin has been stretched to its maximum limit. Though often seen playing with their fellow gang members in the wild, Scraggy can be very aggressive towards strangers. They will stare down foes that make eye contact with them, following by charging headfirst. Violent fights can break out when two Scraggy gangs come across each other. Scraggy are very proud of their tough skulls. They will butt heads with their allies to test their strength. Their heads are also very heavy, however, making them prone to tripping.","Like Scraggy, Scrafty form gangs with others of their kind to prowl around deserts. They are highly territorial, especially against other Scrafty gangs. Scrafty with the largest crests are the leaders of their gangs. When two gangs come across one another, the two leaders will attempt to intimidate each other by spitting and showing off their crests. If the leader with the smaller crest does not defer to the other, the two gangs will brawl viciously. Scrafty fight with powerful kicks strong enough to shatter concrete, though they appear deceivingly uninterested while brawling. As they kick, they pull their baggy skins over themselves to shield their bodies from harm; they can also cover their heads with skin “hoods.” Scrafty can also spit an acidic liquid from their mouths—actually regurgitated stomach acids—to deter foes. Though these Pokémon are notorious for their aggressiveness and territoriality, recent studies have revealed that Scrafty are in fact very protective of their fellow gang members, as well as of their family and of their territory. They will share food and water with injured allies, for example, and will deeply mourn the losses of comrades that have fallen in battle.","Sigilyph are ancient Pokémon that are believed to have lived alongside humans thousands of years ago. Carvings found in the Desert Resort of Unova depict these Pokémon flying around the perimeters of ancient buildings and cities. A Sigilyph will always fly back and forth along the same route, as if constantly patrolling. They will attack objects blocking their patrol paths, attempting to blast holes into them for them to pass through. Based on texts found in the buried Relic Castle underneath the Desert Resort, some archaeologists have hypothesized that Sigilyph used to guard this ancient city that once stood in the desert, and are to this day following the same paths (or perhaps teaching their offspring to do so, as exactly how Sigilyph breed is still unclear) around the fallen city. Others believed they may have served as emissaries of the city's true guardians, performing miscellaneous tasks around the perimeter. Sigilyph possess psychic powers that they use against those that approach them, perhaps as a reflexive attempt to defend their old cities. Recently, a giant geoglyph depicting Sigilyph was found in the Desert Resort; what significance it holds is still unknown.","Yamask are peculiar Pokémon that so far have only been found in the ruins of ancient civilizations, particularly within tombs plated with copious amounts of gold. They appear to be able to converse with others of their kind with quiet murmurings that sound uncannily similar to human speech. Wild Yamask have been known to attempt to speak with human explorers; they will answer questions with inflected, sentence-like cries, but the noises they make are incomprehensible to people. It is likely that this murmuring is the reason why historic archaeologists excavating burial grounds often reported “voices” emanating from the walls. Yamask always carry their golden masks with them at all times, and will become very stressed if they go missing. These Pokémon will often stare at their masks and begin to cry or mourn longingly for unknown reasons. Because of their enigmatic natures, many people believe that Yamask are in fact the spirits of deceased humans from an ancient civilization, carrying masks representing their faces from when they were still alive. It is said that these Pokémon wander aimlessly through ruins in search of someone who will recognize their faces.","Cofagrigus, like Yamask, are rarely-seen Pokémon that inhabit tombs and ruins with copious amounts of gold. These Pokémon consume solid gold in order to repair their own bodies. When deprived of the metal, their bodies become dull and a muted brown in coloration. Cofagrigus remain entirely still most of the time, disguising themselves as an inanimate sarcophagi. To travel, they extend their ethereal limbs and crawl quadrupedally; they are capable of transversing vertical walls and even ceilings in this manner. Popular legend states that Cofagrigus live in tombs to punish grave robbers that attempt to steal burial structures. They are said to wait and pose as solid gold coffins until robbers approach, at which point they grab them with their ghostly arms, open up their bodies, and trap them within, turning them into mummies. Some believe that these Pokémon once used to be ancient kings, whose spirits have forgotten that they were human. In reality, while these Pokémon are not yet fully understood, Cofagrigus have never been seen opening their bodies, let alone trapping people inside. The myth was likely fabricated to deter tourists from sneaking into and disturbing ruins. Curiously, ancient, ornate tombs sometimes depict gilded Cofagrigus on their walls, indicating that their existence had already been known at the time; archaeologists suggest they may have been seen as symbols of wealth by ancient royalty.","Once-extinct Tirtouga can now be revived with modern technology from  Cover Fossils. These Pokémon were alive about 100,000,000 years ago, meaning that they lived in concurrently with many other known fossil Pokémon like Lileep, Anorith, Cranidos, and Shieldon. Why fossils are found so frequently from this time period is unknown, but scientists hypothesize that some sort of massive storm or other disaster may have caused a mass extinction at the end of this era, wiping out many species and disturbing large amounts of sediment that quickly buried and fossilized their remains. Tirtouga can withstand intense pressure and can dive half a mile (0.8 kilometers) beneath the water’s surface. Though slow and clumsy on land, they nevertheless could beach themselves onto shores in order to capture unsuspecting prey. Indeed, some studies suggest that a sizable portion of their meals came from terrestrial prey. Tirtouga are thought to have gone extinct because they was unable to compete with similar chelonians; although their competitors were slower, they also required less food to survive and reproduce.","Carracosta can survive for long periods of time both on land and in the water. Their large lungs can store enough air for them to dive for over half an hour before having to resurface.  They have extremely powerful front flippers, which are capable of breaking through the hulls of oil tankers in a single slap. Carracosta also have very strong jaws, which they use to chew up rocks, shells, bones, and metal ore. They periodically consume these materials in order to strengthen their thick shells, which can withstand bullets fired from point-blank range. It is believed that these Pokémon preyed primarily upon relatives of Omanyte and Omastar, deriving much of the calcium for their own shells from their meals. When Carracosta were first revived in modern times, scientists were unaware of their unusual diets and did not supply them with sufficient iron for their shells. Consequently, they chewed through steel beams supporting the research facility. Like Tirtouga, Carracosta went extinct because of competition from other Pokémon. Though sturdy and strong, they also needed a lot of food to survive, so they could not compete with smaller, faster Pokémon for limited resources.","Archen are once-extinct Pokémon that can be revived from Plume Fossils. The discovery of these fossils sparked an uproar in the scientific community because they presented the first known evidence of ancient feathered Pokémon that, unlike other known avian Pokémon, also had scales and developed tails. Many scientists even thought that Plume Fossils were merely hoaxes, perhaps the fossilized footprints of Pokémon mistaken for feathers. With DNA testing and the subsequent revival of Archen themselves, however, their existence was finally, undoubtedly, proven. Today, Archen are widely believed to be the ancestors of all modern bird Pokémon. They dwell in the treetops of warm jungles; despite their wing-like arms, however, Archen are unable to fly. Instead, they hop from branch to branch to get around. They are known to be very cowardly; though aggressive at first, they will quickly retreat when threatened. Archen are thought to have gone extinct as more adept fliers evolved and outcompeted them for resources. A recent publication has suggested that the connection between Archen and modern avian Pokémon may in fact be false, but the scientific community has yet to reach a consensus on the issue.","Archeops, like Archen, are relatively poor flyers. They can stay aloft for short periods of time by running quickly on the ground and leaping as high as they can, but they are unable to travel more than a few hundred meters in this fashion. Archeops are far faster on land than in the air, reaching speeds of up to 25 mph (40 km/h). Unfortunately, they are still very clumsy terrestrially, as their numerous feathers and heavy, wing-like arms make it difficult for them to stay balanced. Archeops compensate for their lack of agility with their high intelligence and ability to cooperate in flocks. Groups of Archeops will work together to surround and take down prey or gather fruit; they are able to innovate unique strategies in order to do so. Because of their clumsiness, though, any prey that do manage to outsmart them are almost guaranteed to escape. This likely was downfall of these Pokémon; though smart and cooperative, their ungainly movements made it difficult for them compete as faster, more agile predators evolved. A recent excavation revealed a  Helix-like fossil with Archeops bite marks on it, suggesting that not only did Archeops likely hunt relatives of Omanyte while extant, but also that these Pokémon frequented coastal environments to find food as well. Because Archeops feathers are so delicate, it takes a seasoned professional in order to properly restore their fossils; many Plume Fossils have accidentally been destroyed by shoddy work.","Trubbish are found in polluted urban areas, especially in landfills and dumps where solid waste is abundant. They eat whatever trash they can find laying around and incorporate it into their bodies. They are a hardy species that can live nearly anywhere as long as they can find sufficient food. In forests where campers have left trash, for example, one may find groups of them gathered around abandoned campsites. Trubbish are also known to follow people who litter frequently. Some people believe that Trubbish are inorganic Pokémon created from the interaction of toxic waste with industrial garbage bags. Despite their appearances, though, DNA analysis has revealed that Trubbish have organic origins, though their true histories are unknown. Their breaths are putrid due to the garbage they eat; their burps can literally be toxic, depending on what they have eaten recently. The gas they expel when they belch can be knock a person out for a week, or even cause life-threatening issues in young children and Pokémon. Trubbish have gone nearly extinct in Alola due to predation by Alolan Grimer and Muk, who are attracted by their putrid stench. In Galar, however, they have a more benign relationship with Galarian Weezing, who harmlessly feed on the fumes that Trubbish belch out.","Garbodor consume vast amounts of refuse daily. Their bodies contain potent toxins undiscovered by science, developed from the rancid waste they eat; a Garbodor's poisonous cocktail will change daily based on its last meal. They have adapted to consume garbage so efficiently that they do not even have to chew; they simply inhale and swallow trash whole. Though peaceful, Garbodor are more than capable of defending themselves when threatened. They will grab foes with their left hands, spray them with virulent poison from the fingertips on their right hands, and then belch in their faces to knock them unconscious with poison gases. Due to their unpleasant smells and appearances, Garbodor are maligned by many. Some cities have even tried to remove them from their landfills. Despite this vitriol, Garbodor are in fact integral residents of urban areas; they consume waste far more cleanly than any machine, and without them many cities would become exceedingly filthy. An exception to this is in Alola, where they have been driven nearly to extinction by both competition and predation by Alolan Muk. Recent studies suggest, however, that the the Garbodor that do remain in Alola are possibly stronger than their mainland counterparts in evolutionary response to this predatory pressure.","Zorua are wily Pokémon that are skilled in the art of illusion. They can disguise themselves as nearly anything to hide from danger. Zorua are capable of veiling themselves as both humans and Pokémon; unlike Zoroark, however, their tails will remain no matter what guise they take up. Zorua also uses their abilities to trick others and steal their food. They disguise themselves as duplicates of their targets, so that even if they are caught, their victims will be too stunned to react. Zorua also seem to enjoy tricking others purely for fun. They often will assume the forms of human children, pickpocketing passerby while feigning innocence if caught. Their illusions can be broken if they are startled or injured while disguised. Unlike the transforming Pokémon Ditto, however, Zorua do not alter their bodies when disguising themselves; instead, they simply create illusions to fool onlookers. This means that Zorua do not assume the powers of their disguises. Zorua disguised as humans, for example, are unable to talk intelligibly. Zorua are quite cowardly when exposed, and thus always remain disguised expect when around friends.","Zoroark have mastered the art of illusion. In addition to being able to disguise themselves, these Pokémon can conjure entire landscapes and beings around themselves to fool onlookers. Their illusions are highly realistic; they can even make people believe that they have been physically hit by attacks that had in fact been illusory. Zoroark will protect their lairs with false scenery that conceal their entrances, luring potential intruders away without their knowledge. They normally live in packs, the members of which are highly protective of one another.  They are especially defensive of their young, which they will often carry within their thick manes. Zoroark are very intelligent Pokémon; some have even learned human languages in order to produce more convincing human disguises. These Pokémon are known to be very vengeful, trapping anyone that harms their friends or families in eternal, frightful illusions. The only way to break a Zoroark’s illusion without its consent is to harm the Zoroark itself, a task that is nearly impossible for the unfortunate being trapped within it.","Minccino live in large herds in woodlands and on rocky mountains. These Pokémon are obsessed with cleanliness and will not rest until their surroundings are absolutely spotless. They use their soft tails as brooms to sweep the ground and clean dirty rocks and leaves, which they will also organize into neat, symmetrical patterns. Afterwards, they will spend as much as much as an entire day washing their tails in clear spring water. Two Minccino will greet each other by rubbing tails together and then using their tails to groom each. The Minccino with the fluffier tail will assert itself as the more dominant of the pair. These creatures also loves shiny objects; they will obsessively polish any metal that they find until it sparkles in the sunlight. Herds of Minccino ​can be found crowded around broken glass discarded by hikers in the wild, attracted by the glimmering shards. Minccino fur is highly coveted for its luxurious feel, said to be akin to soft velvet. Unfortunately, this has led to extensive poaching of Minccino, despite efforts by many regions to curb such activity. These Pokémon have become critically endangered in the wild due to poaching and the incessant demand for their fur.","Cinccino are rare sights in the wild, since they need Shiny Stones to evolve. Their fur is just as soft as that of Minccino, but it has a few additional properties that make it unique. Firstly, the hairs of Cinccino fur are arranged in such a way that they prevent static electricity from building up; additionally, the fur is also coated in oil that repels dust and water, which beads and slides right off their bodies. This special oil also helps them deflect and blunt attacks, both physical and ranged. This helps them resist harm from other Pokémon as well as slip out of dangerous situations even when cornered. Cinccino will coat their nests in this oil to keep them spotless, as they will not tolerate even the smallest speck of dust. Unlike Minccino fur, there is little demand for Cinccino fur on the black market despite its strange properties. This is because the oil coating the fur makes it unsuitable for clothing and most other uses. Additionally, the rarity of Cinccino make them poor choices for economic profit. However, the oil that they secrete is popular, if a bit expensive, as a skin treatment. Like Minccino, Cinccino also are focused on cleanliness; they use their scarf-like fur to wipe down surfaces before touching them.","Gothita are odd Pokémon found primarily in run-down areas of human towns and cities. Unlike many first-stage Pokémon, Gothita have extremely long attention spans; when they notice something new, they will stare at it intently for minutes or even hours on end. Gothita sometimes forget to blink as they stare and occasionally even fail to notice when they are being attacked in battle due to how closely they are examining their opponents. Sometimes, these Pokémon will even stare out into thin air, focusing on what appears to be nothing to most onlookers. They have also been observed \"speaking\" in muted, inaudible tones when doing so. Groups of Gothita are known to congregate around and fixate upon the same spot in the air, leading some researchers to suggest that these Pokémon may be able to see and talk to things that no other beings can. No scientific studies have successfully proven this theory, however. The bow-like feelers that adorn their heads amplify their psychic powers. If these feelers are disturbed while Gothita are examining something, they will lose their concentration and snap out of their trances.","Whereas Gothita are sometimes seen as unsettling due to their piercing stares, Gothorita are feared in many rural communities due to the many urban legends surrounding their behavior. Gothorita are nocturnal and are said to derive their psychic powers from starlight and constellations. These Pokémon will arrange stones to match the positions of the stars overhead and then levitate them in the air for unknown reasons. Many legends say this practice is a ritual that grants Gothorita the power to hypnotize and control the minds of unwary people and Pokémon nearby. Gothorita are believed to lead people away from their homes and into forests in this manner, wiping their memories along the way. Some legends even tell stories of how lonely Gothorita will hypnotize young children while they lay asleep on starry nights, manipulating them to play with the Gothorita as “friends.” For this reason, Gothorita in some areas are known as \"witches of the night.\" Despite these haunting tales, there is no scientific evidence that these Pokémon engage in such activities, and it is likely that these wild stories were simply spawned by their odd, inexplicable behaviors.","Gothitelle are respected by people and Pokémon alike because of their tremendous psychic capabilities. They can emit intense psychic powers capable of momentarily distorting space thousands of light-years away. These Pokémon are amazingly adept at reading star charts and examining the night sky, observing the positions and movements of celestial bodies in order to predict the future. Because of their foresight, people in ancient times used to consult Gothitelle for advice, predictions, and warnings. Many pieces of ancient literature around the world allude to translated prophecies given by these Pokémon. Gothitelle are also capable of showing cryptic images of their predictions to onlookers by projecting them onto the empty space surrounding them. They can predict the lifespans of other living creatures, including those of themselves, their friends, and their trainers. As a result, despite their great power, Gothitelle are often seen sad or crying because of what they know is ultimately inevitable for both themselves and their loved ones. It is said that if one ever manages to glimpse their true fate through a Gothitelle, one would go mad from the revelation.","Solosis are believed to be a very primitive species, having remained unchanged for thousands, perhaps even millions, of years. They are enormous single-celled organisms that have developed specialized organelles analogous to the more complex organs of multicellular Pokémon. Their cell membranes enclose their green, gelatinous cytoplasm; the two substances guard Solosis from a staggering range of conditions, allowing them to survive virtually anywhere. Their membranes shield them from radiation and harsh weather, while their cytoplasm regulates their temperature and internal pressure. Because of these properties, Solosis cytoplasm is currently being researched for use in volcanic and benthic submersibles. Similarly, scientists are trying to replicate their membranes for applications in space travel. However, extreme blunt force is capable of tearing the membranes and allowing some fluid to leak out. Solosis have highly-developed, spiral-shaped organelles on the left sides of their heads that function like brains. They allows Solosis to wield moderate psychic powers and also enable them to communicate telepathically with others of their kind.","When Solosis evolve into Duosion, a curious process occurs. They undergo mitosis to divide in two, but stop halfway; this leaves two sets of organelles in their bodies, but only a single cell membrane to contain them. Duosion are still technically a single cell, but because of their arrested development, they sometimes seem to act as two separate beings. This is because they quite literally have two separate “brains” (really the spiral-shaped organelles they had as Solosis, which have migrated into their heads from outside prior to mitosis). The two structures often act independently from one another, forcing Duosion to attempt to execute both actions simultaneously. This usually renders their movements jerky and erratic. Occasionally, both of their brain-like organelles will have the same thought, often due to experiencing a shared threat or initiating an innate reflex. The psychic powers of Duosion are strongest when this occurs--able to reach over half a mile (0.8 kilometers) away--as both organelles are able to act in unison rather than independently in order to focus their abilities.","Reuniclus are unique in that though they are single-celled organisms, their organelles have developed so exceptionally that they are able to consciously shape their cell membranes, cytoplasm, and nuclei (which have adapted to become their main bodies) at will. The brain-like organelles they had as Solosis and Duosion have developed into networks similar to the nervous systems of multicellular beings. By connecting hands with other Reuniclus, these Pokémon can also connect their organelle networks and greatly amplify their psychic powers. Their pseudo-nervous systems enable them to manipulate their membranes and cytoplasm like quasi-muscular systems; they can grasp objects with their “hands” that, with the aid of psychic power, are strong enough to crush boulders. In fact, they seem to prefer fighting in this pseudo-physical way, with reinforced punches, rather than relying solely on psychokinesis. Reuniclus are capable of regenerating torn cell membranes and lost cytoplasm over time; however, damage to their nuclear membranes or their contents, as well as the organelles floating in their “arms,” is almost always permanent. Their cytoplasm is designed to cushion these vital structures. A popular urban legend states that drinking a Reuniclus's cytoplasm will grant one great wisdom. However, this legend is patently false, as the fluid is in fact highly toxic to most creatures if ingested; a famous ancient philosopher is said to have died attempting this very act.","Ducklett inhabit slightly acidic ponds, though they can also sometimes be found splashing around in large puddles. Their favorite food is peat moss, which is abundant in their habitats. Ducklett never leave their mothers’ sides, walking behind them in single-file lines with their siblings. Ducklett are excellent divers. They will spend long periods of time completely submerged as they search for food. Ducklett are poor fliers, however, so they rarely take to the air, even when endangered. If attacked in the water, Ducklett will splash about wildly to distract opponents as they escape. The splashing also alerts their mothers and siblings of approaching danger. Ducklett store water in flexible sacs within their bodies; on land, they can then spray this stored water from specialized feathers on their wings at the eyes of foes, briefly obscuring their vision as they frantically waddle away. Their distressed quacking will signal to their siblings to aid them in spraying more water as well, potentially blinding threats from all possible angles.","Swanna are very protective of their offspring, who follow behind them in single-file lines at all times. Despite their elegant appearances, Swanna are very territorial and deceptively powerful. Their long necks contain powerful muscles that allow them to lunge back and forth very rapidly in order to pierce intruders that enter their domains with their sharp beaks. Their wings are also very strong. In the winter, Swanna without offspring will migrate south, potentially flying thousands of miles in order to reach warmer areas. Swanna are unique in that, despite being territorial, theywill still meet in “flocks” during specific times of the day. At dusk, they will congregate together in the middle of ponds or lakes to complete a ritualistic dance. The Swanna in the centers of these dances are the leaders of the local populations; all of the other Swanna will cede their food or land when confronted by these individuals. Once these rituals are completed, the individual Swanna will return to their own territories and resume being hostile towards others. ","The origins of Vanillite are unclear. In Unova folklore, children are told that they arose from icicles that were bathed in the morning sun but wished with all of their might that they would not melt. However, their bodies do not truly resemble icicles, as they have ovoid heads covered by slush. This slush is very sensitive to heat and will melt almost immediately once the ambient air temperature rises above freezing point. Touching the slush with a finger will cause it to melt at the point of contact, exposing the icy heads that they cover. To keep their slush from melting, Vanillite will sleep buried within piles of snow. It is unclear what purpose this slush serves, however. Their breaths can reach a freezing -58°F (-50°C), keeping them cloaked in frosty air; they are sometimes sent out for mere seconds in warm areas to lower temperatures. Any longer than this, however, and their icy bodies will slowly begin to shrink. Their breaths can also freeze water in the air to form snow. Casteliacones, which are sold in Castelia City, Unova, are a popular regional version of soft-serve ice cream that superficially resemble Vanillite. The design was chosen because of how Vanillite are associated with cold weather.","Vanillish and their relatives have been around for thousands of years, but have only been discovered a few centuries ago because of the bitter coldness of their habitats. Vanillish can freeze water in the air into icy mist that can blind and even freeze foes solid in this manner. They drink water from glacial streams and store it within their bodies, simultaneously expelling and freezing it from pores in their bodies to freeze enemies solid before headbutting and shattering them. Vanillish cannot tolerate temperatures even slightly above the freezing point of water, as the slush covering their heads would melt and leave their icy cores exposed. Because of this, they are naturally confined to frozen peaks and glaciers. Despite this, they are very popular in the tropics due to their air-chilling abilities; trainers in regions like Alola must treat their Vanillish periodically with insulating spray to keep them cold; such individuals also tend to be smaller than those found in polar areas. Though once widespread during a past ice age, areas suitable for Vanillish and their relatives shrank and became isolated from each other during a warming period, separated by bands of warmer temperatures that they could not cross. Today, they can only be found in the icy parts of the southern hemisphere and a select few other chilly areas. Vanillish are surprisingly kind Pokémon; they dislike violence and prefer to immobilize attackers just long enough for them to flee without harming them any further.","Vanilluxe are two-headed Pokémon that only dwell in the coldest parts of the world. Their heads are slightly different than other multi-headed Pokémon because they appear to share certain portions of their brains, whereas other polycephalic Pokémon have separate brains entirely. For example, their heads will experience the same emotions at the same time; they may, however, express the emotions differently with their facial expressions and behaviors. They can survive with only one head, however. It was once believed that Vanilluxe formed when two Vanllish, partially melted from the day's heat, stuck together and refroze together during the night. Vanilluxe drinks large quantities of glacial water to store within  their bodies. When both heads feel threatened , Vanilluxe will freeze and violently release their stored water as snow clouds or blizzards. This attack is indiscriminate and can freeze both friend and foe. The pipe-like structures growing out of their left heads constantly emit icy mist that shrouds them, keeping the ambient air sufficiently cold to prevent their slush from melting and concealing them from attackers. This icy mist eventually settles to create piles of snow, making these Pokémon incredibly popular amongst snowboarders and skiers. When Vanilluxe stop producing this mist, it is a sign that they are thirsty need more water to freeze and release.","Deerling are found primarily in montane forests, though they are known to venture into lowland areas from time to time as well. They are herbivorous Pokémon that graze on low-growing vegetation. They are also very timid, hiding in tall grass at the slightest indication of danger. Deerling are most famous for their ability to change color in accordance with the seasons. These Pokémon are pink in the spring (to blend in with budding flowers), green in the summer (to camouflage with verdant vegetation), orange in the fall (to match autumn leaves), and brown in the winter (to hide against bare trees).Their scents also change to match that of the vegetation of each season, in order to further conceal themselves from predators. Their fur’s hue is also affected by temperature and humidity. When near the equator, where seasons are less pronounced than in temperate areas, Deerling may only change color slightly or even not at all. These Pokémon were used in the past to mark the changing of the seasons.","Sawsbuck live in herds in montane forests. Their most striking features are their antlers, which host a variety of different plants throughout the year. These plants obtain nutrients from the vegetation Sawsbuck eat, and in turn provide them with camouflage to hide in the surrounding environments. In the spring, the flowers budding on their antlers match those growing around them. In the summer and autumn, vivid leaves grow and change color to let Sawsbuck blend in with the trees of the forest. Finally, in the winter, white moss grows over their antlers and fur to allow them to conceal themselves in snow. Sawsbuck herds are led by the individuals with the largest antlers and most beautiful plants growing on them. These Pokémon migrate to different areas each season; because of this, people often refer to them as the “harbingers of spring,” because they return to their initial habitats once spring comes around again. Like Deerling, people often use the antlers of Sawsbuck to determine the season.","Like many Electric-type rodents, Emolga produce and store electricity within their cheek pouches. They have cape-like membranes under their arms that allow them to glide from tree to tree in forests. Emolga are also able to ride winds with their membranes; they can even ascend upwards and soar when weather conditions are ideal. These membranes discharge electricity as they glide. Though rather clumsy on the ground, Emolga are agile both in the trees and in the air. To avoid predators, Emolga will leap from one tree branch and glide to another while attempting to shock them from above in hopes of knocking them to the ground. Their aerial agility allows them to escape from the vast majority of terrestrial predators, though unfavorable weather conditions and storms may hinder their abilities. Emolga nest in the nooks of tree branches or the hollows of tree trunks in holes made by Pikipek. These Pokémon will collect nuts and Berries and store them near their nests in preparation for winter. Emolga will defend their nests very fiercely with electric shocks; this keeps most avian Pokémon away from their otherwise-vulnerable food caches. When thunderstorms arrive, whole populations Emolga will take flight, sometimes amassing in large enough numbers to blot out the sky.","Karrablast dwell in wetlands where Shelmet can also be found, though they may also wander into grassy fields. They are very territorial, butting heads with other Karrablast using the horns on their head to compete for space. Karrablast can spit a mildly corrosive acid from their mouths to deter predators. This acid rarely has a lasting impact on larger foes, however (unless it makes contact with the eyes or other vulnerable locations), so Karrablast often choose to hide in trees or grasses instead to avoid detection. These Pokémon feed on soft-bodied mollusks, dissolving their vulnerable insides with acid while leaving their shells intact. They spend much of their time searching for Shelmet to facilitate their evolutions. When they find them, Karrablast will use their horns to pry the Shelmet out of their shells, which they steal for themselves. With some sort of electrical stimulus, such as a trade, both Pokémon can then evolve. In the wild, competition for Shelmet can be fierce between Karrablast, who will invade each other’s territories and spar with rivals for Shelmet. Shelmet have been known to use this time to sneak away from the danger.","Once Karrablast successfully steal the shells of Shelmet and experience some sort of electrical stimulus with their victims, they can then evolve into Escavalier. Upon evolution, their stolen shells becomes part of their own bodies; they sacrifice speed for power and durability. Escavalier are able to adjust their armor so that it protects their whole bodies. In addition to piercing foes, they can also use their lances to parry incoming attacks. Though very slow in practice, Escavalier have been known to reach surprisingly high speeds by charging to gain momentum and then leaping so that they “fly” at foes, piercing even the toughest armor with their lances. Because of how much time and space Escavalier need to charge up, however, they rarely are able to execute this technique in battle. Escavalier have a reputation for being brave and courageous Pokémon. They will not give up in fights until they are defeated, no matter how bleak the odds appear to be. Escavalier are often depicted in medieval artwork fighting in battle alongside humans. This is especially true in Kalos and Galar, where they are popular Pokémon; in the latter, they are commonly painted as dueling with Sirfetch'd.","Foongus are known for their oddly-patterned caps, which resemble the faces of Poké Balls. For years, these curious adaptations baffled scientists because the caps did not have the gloss, size, or shape of true Poké Balls; laboratory experiments have revealed that the vast majority of wild Pokémon, when showed a real Poké Ball and then a Foongus cap, did not mistake one for the other. A recent, promising hypothesis regarding the cap pattern postulates that while the design is unconvincing from close range, it is sufficient for deterring avian Pokémon—one of their major groups of predators—flying above. In addition to this questionable camouflage, Foongus also have the ability to release poisonous spores to defend themselves from foes. Unfortunately, Foongus spores are one of the most common poisons traveling trainers are afflicted with. Because they resemble Poké Balls when seen from above, many careless trainers approach them and are subsequently doused with their poisonous spores.","While the crypsis of Foongus is arguably useful in certain situations, that of Amoonguss has been proven to have no use at all, even possibly being detrimental to their survival. While their caps resemble Poké Balls, their texture, shape, and size make them difficult to mistake for the real thing from any angle at all. In the damp, dark areas where Amoonguss dwell, low light levels make such camouflage even less effective, as the red coloration of the caps are dulled and made even less recognizable. Rather than providing a survival advantage, their cap designs appear to be remnants of their pre-evolutions’ survival tactic; because Amoonguss can protect themselves in other ways, their Poké Ball patterns have survived as well despite contributing little to their survival. Like Foongus, Amoonguss are capable of spreading poisonous, incapacitating spores in the air around them. They sway their arm caps and bodies around in intriguing dances to lure in prey, spraying them with their spores once them draw near to paralyze them. ","Frillish live in the deepest, darkest parts of the ocean, where no light ever penetrates. They can be found as deep as five miles (8 kilometers) beneath the surface, resting in trenches and underwater caves. At dusk, Frillish float to higher oceanic zones in search of prey. They float slowly, but silently and stealthily in the ocean currents. Victims almost never notice these Pokémon approaching until it is too late. To capture prey, Frillish wrap their ribbon-like tentacles around their victims, paralyzing them with an incapacitating poison injected by the near-invisible spines lining these appendages. Females tend to have slightly longer spines. Then, Frillish drag their prey down into the ocean depths and back to their lairs, where victims succumb to the crushing pressure of the water above and drown. Because of their eerie natures and vaguely humanoid appearances, some believe that Frillish are actually the reincarnated souls of sailors lost at sea, or perhaps the residents of an ancient sunken city. Small swarms of these Pokémon sometimes congregate around boats in the middle of the sea at night; according to legend, this is because Frillish recall their memories of sailing in their past lives.","Jellicent spend much of their time in the deepest parts of the ocean. These Pokémon mate for life and tend to be social amongst others of their kind. Swarms of Jellicent are often found in ocean trenches and abysses. When night falls, Jellicent venture to the ocean’s surface to feed. By absorbing and then expelling seawater from their bodies, they can propel themselves and swim about. In fact, their body compositions are almost exactly identical to the composition of seawater. Many seafaring legends warn of Jellicent swarms, cautioning that no ship or crew has ever entered a Jellicent habitat and returned. Indeed, Jellicent do seem to have an unusual affinity for human ships; between these Pokémon and Dragalge, nearly all cases of “vanishing” vessels are accounted for. They tend to be found more frequently near cruise ships and tankers full of passengers. Jellicent feed on life force, leaving victims as empty husks that sink down into the ocean depths. They even seem to congregate at the ocean's surface on nights of the full moon, when ships are most plentiful. Their crowns are thought to grow larger the more life force they consume. It is said that on the ocean floor lies a Jellicent castle made of sunken shipwrecks. Superstitious sailors purport that this castle is an attempt by Jellicent, believed to be the souls of people lost at sea, to reclaim their old lives in an undersea civilization. ","Alomomola live in the pelagic zone of warm seas. They are often seen by fishermen leaping out of the water in graceful arcs. Alomomola enjoy “sunbathing,” lying down horizontally just beneath the surface. They are covered in mucoid membranes that are famous for their healing properties. These altruistic Pokémon will bring injured creatures they find close to them and envelop them in their membranes while in their “sunbathing” positions before carrying them back to shore like rafts. Many ocean Pokémon congregate near them because of this. There has been at least one reported case of an Alomomola carrying a drowning human child to safety in this manner. Scientists believe that this altruistic behavior may have evolved to help Alomomola defend themselves from nearby predators; though slow, these Pokémon stand a better chance against predators when partnered with newly-healed allies. Unfortunately, because of their special membranes, Alomomola have become targets for oceanic poachers in recent years. Perhaps due to their healing membranes, Alomomola are oddly immune to many common poisons, including that of marine Pokémon like Frillish and Tentacool. Alomomola in fact primarily prey on these species, which most other Pokémon avoid due to their incapacitating toxins. These Pokémon were, and still are, a favorite amongst long-distance sailors, helping treat injuries while out at sea and away from professional medical care.","Joltik are some of the smallest Pokémon in the world. Because of their size, Joltik are unable to hunt prey like their evolution Galvantula. Instead, these Pokémon drain electricity from sources around them. In most cases, a Joltik will attach itself to a Pokemon’s fur using its bristles to keep itself latched on, feeding on the static electricity that the fur generates as the Pokémon moves. Joltik store this electricity in small pouches within their bodies; they can release it to stun opponents when threatened. Joltik cannot generate electricity, so they require hosts charge. The relationship between a Joltik and its host is usually mutualistic; the Joltik feeds on generated static electricity while defending the host from predators with stunning shocks. Joltik attached to Electric-type Pokémon, however, can be problematic, as they will begin to drain the internal electricity of their hosts alongside the static electricity they naturally generate. In cities, Joltik have been observed feeding from power outlets or directly from generators, occasionally causing minor blackouts. They are also a common parasite of Electrike and Yamper, attaching to their hindquarters and draining them of electrical energy.","Galvantula live within forests and caves in large swarms known as “clusters.” The borders of a Galvantula cluster’s territory is clearly marked by a netting of electrified webs that deters foes from approaching. Their primary weapon against enemies is the technique known as Electroweb, in which they release threads of electrically-charged silk that entangle and shock opponents. Galvantula use these webs to immobilize prey when hunting as well as to slow down attackers pursuing them. They will lay down stunning webs near the nests of avian Pokémon to catch chicks that are still poor at flying. As a secondary measure, these Pokémon have very strong mandibles and are capable of pinning down struggling foes until they succumb to paralysis in their silk prisons. Additionally, they can even fire charged bristles from their abdomens to paralyze fleeing prey, leaving them stunned for up to three days. After taking down prey, Galvantula will then proceed to consume their meals over the course of a few days. Despite their menacing appearances, Galvantula are not aggressive Pokémon. They tend to ignore anything that they do not consider prey, including humans. However, Galvantula are fiercely protective of their clusters; angering a single individual in a group will cause the entire swarm to attack the aggressor.","Ferroseed are one of the main hazards spelunkers face when exploring mineral-rich caverns. These heavy Pokémon can be found stuck to the walls and ceilings of caves, absorbing minerals through their spikes. When they have finished draining one location of nutrients, they will roll (on walls) or drop down (from ceilings) to new locations—hikers must constantly be aware of what is above them, since Ferroseed can and will drop without any notice; in Chargestone Cave of the Unova region, injuries from falling Ferroseed actually are the most common cause of harm. Though unintentionally dangerous, Ferroseed are acutally rather docile Pokémon. They won’t attack unless attacked first, and even when faced an aggressor, the most a Ferroseed will do is release a burst of spikes being rolling away to safety. Their aim is quite poor without practice, however. Though their spikes make them very poor movers, Ferroseed can actually spin in place quickly by balancing themselves on the point of a single spike like a top. They have been known to lodge themselves into rocks in this manner. Recently, scientists have discovered that Ferrossed not only absorb minerals from stone through their spikes, but also vital nutrients from the moss that covers cave walls and ceilings.","Ferrothorn dwell in mineral-rich caves, using their three spike-tipped feelers to cling to cavern ceilings and floors. To hunt, these creatures hang idly from the tops of caves, waiting for unsuspecting victims to pass underneath. When they come along, Ferrothorn fire barrages of spikes to subdue them before dropping down below to claim their meals. Ferrothorn will also scrape away at cavern walls to siphon exposed minerals and ores using their spikes. Their feelers are deceptively strong, capable of supporting their weight and allowing them to “stand” upright on the ground. In this stance, Ferrothorn can swing their feelers like flails to attack foes. The tips of these feelers are strong enough to pulverize stone. Their hard, spiked bodies protect them from most attackers; however, they are also very sensitive to heat. Ferrothorn will seek shelter in the damp recesses of their caverns if they feel the air warming. Excessively heat can cause their normally-sturdy bodies to soften slightly, rendering them vulnerable to further attacks. Spelunkers in Unova’s Chargestone Cave are advised to use torches instead of lamps in order to scare off wild Ferrothorn.","Klink are odd Pokémon that were first discovered within Chargestone Cave in Unova. According to the region’s premier Pokémon researcher Professor Juniper, the earliest evidence regarding their existence dates back just over a century. While their origins are unknown, today, these Pokémon can be found in industrial areas in addition to Chargestone Cave. The two units that comprise a Klink are each known as “minigears.” Though they appear identical, no two minigears are alike; each one fits into exactly one other minigear, while any others ones that attempt to interlock are rejected. Once two minigears join to form a Klink, they will begin to spin effortlessly to generate energy, jumpstarted by magnetic force. The spin from one unit pushes the other, which pushes back, and so on as a perpetual motion system. If Klink become separated after interlocking, both minigears will enter an inert state. By interlocking them again and setting them in motion, however, they will reanimate as if nothing had happened. Some modern archaeologists believe that Klink inspired ancient peoples in the Galar region to design primitive gears based on recent evidence; they hypothesize that Klink disappeared from subsequent historical records alongside the people that had worked with them.","Upon evolution, Klang gain third gears that spin in tandem with their first two. These additional gears give these Pokémon a greater range of abilities; by spinning each of their gears at varying speeds, Klang can communicate with each other. Direction appears to indicate emotions, while speed relates to the intensity of these feelings. Like Klink, Klang are powered by the perpetual spinning of their minigears. The loss of a gear will cause them to become inert; in the wild, this is essentially akin to death, as it is unlikely that minigears will be able to reattach themselves without the ability to move (though this problem is less distressing for Klang under the command of trainers). To attack, Klang will fire one of their minigears in such a way that it will hit the opponent and then arc back to its initial location. The two unfired gears continue spinning during this period thanks to their angular momentum. After their minigears hit their targets and return, these Pokémon will expend energy to return their spinning to normal speeds. In extreme situations, Klang will adjust their minigears such that all three connect and spin in tandem; this sharply increases their rotation speed and combat prowess. Klang are commonly seen as symbols of industrial progress and are a popular logo in Galar.","Klinklang gain fourth gears upon evolution, which unlike their previous three minigears, are not sentient. The red cores of these gears functions as energy tanks that stores the energy generated while these Pokémon spin. These additions enable Klinklang to stay active even when missing gears or not spinning. Their energy cores will glow more weakly when they are nearly drained; if a Klinklang’s light goes out, it means that it has exhausted all of its stored energy and will enter an inert state just like its pre-evolutions. The fourth gears also serve secondary purposes as weapons in battle. By spinning these gears quickly, Klinklang can rapidly charge their cores and cause them to glow brightly. Then, they can release the stored electrical nergy through the spikes on their large gears to blast opponents. Their multiple gears also grant them a number of exclusive techniques, such as Gear Shift and Gear Grind. Though they appear unintelligent, Klinklang have demonstrated considerable ability to comprehend language and emotion, expressing this through changes in the spinning of their gears.","Tynamo live in large schools. Though technically amphibious, these Pokémon can live their lives either entirely on water, on land, or both with no ill effects. When not in the water, Tynamo levitate by generating weak electromagnetic forces beneath them. These Pokémon tend to congregate in damper areas where they can easily access water to keep themselves hydrated. They have tiny organs that generates minute electrical charges they can use to shock foes, though the weak voltage fails to significantly hinder opponents. Tynamo, however, find strength in numbers; while individually weak, many Tynamo emitting their shocks together can create jolts as strong as bolts of lightning. When threatened, a school of Tynamo will ball tightly together so that any foes that attempt to attack will be met with discharged electricity from the entire group. In some regions, the tiny shocks of electricity from a lone Tynamo were traditionally used to numb small regions of the body prior to invasive medical operations.","Like Tynamo, Eeletrik dwell either in marine waters or damp caves where they do not run the risk of being dried out by the sunlight. These serpentine Pokémon slither about in the water and in the air in constant search of food. The spots that run down the lengths of their bodies can also release electricity in short bursts. When they come across suitable prey, Eelektric will rush at their victims and quickly coil their bodies around them, paralyzing them with electricity to prevent their escape. Eelektrik will begin searching for another meal immediately after eating, as they are voracious eaters. If unable to find small prey for long periods of time, these species will even go after larger, slow-moving Pokémon such as Alomomola or even Wailord. Instead of constricting and shocking them, however, Eelektrik will dart in and sink their teeth into their sides, tearing out circular holes of flesh and swimming away before the larger Pokémon are able to react. Such Eelektrik attacks can leave distinctive round scars on their victims.","Eelektrik exposed to Thunder Stones evolve into Eelektross. Because of this requirement, these Pokémon are scarce in the wild and rarely seen outside of the command of trainers. In areas where there are wild Eelektross, however, they serve as apex predators, both in and out of the water. Eelektross use their sucker-like mouths to draw in smaller prey and swallow them whole. To subdue larger victims, they latch onto them with their teeth and let loose powerful electric shocks. Capable of both levitating and waddling on land with their flippers, Eelektross will ambush unsuspecting prey on the shore. They will grab victims with their arms before sinking in their fangs, electrocuting them, and dragging them into the sea. These Pokémon are territorial, claiming large swathes of shoreline as their own. They engage in displays of dominance using the crest-like fins on their heads to assert themselves. Notably, both male and female Eelektross engage in this behavior, unlike in most species where only the males do so.","Elgyem are the focus of many conspiracy theories involving space travel and extraterrestrials. Many link their discovery in the early 1950s to a purported UFO crash on Unova Route 4, since these Pokémon appeared suddenly after the time incident is said to have occurred. While many amateur UFO enthusiasts have took it upon themselves to research the origins of Elgyem, no concrete evidence has been found pointing to them originating from outer space (curiously, despite the media commotion these Pokémon caused upon discovery, no public large-scale or government-funded research has been conducted regarding Elgyem). These Pokémon appear to communicate by flashing the lights on their hands. They seem to be highly inquisitive about novel objects, examining and playing with them using their psychokinetic powers. Though not inherently aggressive, Elgyem will use their powerful psychic abilities to give foes crippling headaches when threatened. Those afflicted often wake up with no memory of what had occurred. It is said that when Elgyem pass by media devices, the electronics will begin to display an image of their true home--though it is unlikely that anyone who sees the image will remember it for very long.","Beheeyem are very rarely reported as seen in the wild; they tend to be reclusive and shy away from human contact. It is difficult for researchers to even estimate the number of wild Beheeyem—using their psychic powers in tandem with the flashing lights on their hands, these Pokémon are able to control and manipulate the memories of others; they appear to erase the memories of those that discover them. Based on the behavior of Elgyem, Beheeyem likely use these lights to communicate with each other. Also like Elgyem, many conspiracy theories surround the origins and even existence of Beheeyem. One of the most popular proposes an explanation as to why the UFO they supposedly arrived on was never recovered—the Beheeyem erased the memories of witnesses immediately after the crash, disposing of the debris and leaving nobody with any recollection of the event. Some also theorize that Beheeyem use their abilities to thwart research on themselves and Elgyem, which is why there have been no major studies on these Pokémon to date. Beheeyem are thought to be fond of visiting rural areas, especially wheat fields and pastures; it is said that when a lone Dubwool or Miltank disappears from a farm, a Beheeyem is the culprit.","At a first glance, a distant Litwick may appear to simply be an ordinary, unlit candle. However, approach it and it will suddenly spring alive, its wick bursting into flames as it smiles cheerfully. This is the primary hunting strategy of Litwick; when living beings approach, they light up and pretend to guide them through dark areas, or provide them warmth during a cold night. They are actually absorbing and burning the life energy of these beings as fuel, eventually sending them into the spirit world. Litwick will intentionally take wrong turns and go in circles to stall time as they continues to burn life energy. If a Litwick runs out of this energy, its flame will go out, and it will need to absorb more lifer force in order to light up again. Litwick are said to especially prefer luring away children, as younger lives give them more energy. They will even take young children by the hand to ensure that they follow along to \"play.\" When under the control of trainer, assuming that the Litwick is well-fed and trained, it will likely not attempt to burn the life energy of others as fuel. For confirmation, look at flames of these Pokémon; they will glow an ethereal, ghostly blue if they are burning life force, but will remain a dull purple when they are not.","Lampent are feared in many cultures around the world for being omens of death, and for good reason. These Pokémon can sense when death is imminent; they will appear on the deathbeds of beings to steal their spirits as fuel for their fires. Lampent used to be found primarily in the deepest parts of dark woods, but now can also be seen in urban areas, oftentimes clustered near hospitals with deathly-ill patients. They are also found wandering dark alleys near the houses of the sick and elderly. Lampent are so strongly associated with death in some areas that lanterns in graveyards have been modeled after them. In modern times, Lampent have even been known to pose as lamps while trailing behind those not long for this world. Lampent appear to be the mortal enemies of the Pokémon Dusknoir, who similarly appear to people and Pokémon near death. However, while Dusknoir take spirits within their bellies to ferry them to the spirit world, Lampent consume them in their flames. Some say that those who are kind and benevolent while alive are taken by Dusknoir, while those who were malicious and cruel are burned by Lampent.","Chandelure are exceedingly rare in the wild, as Lampent require Dusk Stones in order to evolve. They primarily inhabit abandoned mansions and large manors. These Pokémon are frightening hunters that are willing to go after just about any living being as prey. When Chandelure finds victims, they will begin to wave their flames around in mesmerizing dances. These movements are, for unknown reasons, very hypnotic and compelling, putting anyone who sees them in a deep trance. As they continue to dance, they will begin to cloak their prey in mysterious, bluish-purple flames. These flames do not feel hot or painful and do not leave any physical traces of harm; instead, they burn the life energy of victims and transfers it to themselves to burn as fuel. After the process is complete, the Chandelure float away, leaving lifeless husks drained of their spirits behind. It is said that those consumed by Chandelure in this manner are doomed to wander this world in a state of limbo, where they no longer have a spirit to enter the spirit world nor a physical body for this one. It is said that houses that experience frequent tragedy may in fact be home to a furtive Chandelure.","Axew are territorial Pokémon that tend to live in caves near rivers. Their most distinctive features are the two tusks protruding from either sides of their mouths. Axew use these tusks to leave gashes on tree trunks to mark their territories. Initially, these tusks are very brittle and prone to breaking off. However, when an Axew’s tusk breaks, it will grow back stronger and sturdier than it was before. This gradual strengthening encourages Axew to test their tusks on increasingly hard objects, from wood to stone to even metal. Axew tusks grow back quickly and are primarily used to defend the Pokémon as well as crack open hard Berries for them to eat. Young Axew will compete with one another to crack the hardest Berries as displays of strength. Axew ivory jewelry, crafted from the tusks of these Pokémon, has been recently popularized as a sustainable and ethical alternative to traditional (and now illegal) Donphan ivory. Since Axew tusks not only break off harmlessly but also grow back quickly, Axew ivory is constantly in abundance. The ivory is often treated with chemicals before crafting into jewelry to make it less brittle.","Eventually, after going through a specific number of tusks (the true number is unknown, since tusks may break off incompletely or only on one side but not the other), an Axew will grow its final set of tusks and evolve into a Fraxure. Unlike Axew, a Fraxure’s tusks will not regenerate; if one breaks off in combat, the Fraxure will be rendered handicapped, not only in battle but in simple movement, as the tusks also provides these Pokèmon with balance. For this reason, Fraxure spend much of their time whetting their tusks on river rocks, sharpening them as much as possible to ensure clean slices instead of dull hits. These tusks are capable of shattering boulders without breaking. Fraxure are fiercely territorial; a fight between two Fraxure over land can be very gruesome, as neither will back down until the other is either maimed or without a tusk. These Pokémon will become anxious if they are not able to sharpen their tusks; they sometimes will even forgo searching for food in favor of looking for suitable stones to whet their tusks on. A Fraxure's carapace is as hard as armor. These Pokémon prefer tackling opponents with their sturdy bodies while simultaneously goring them with their tusks as their go-to attack.","A Haxorus’s tusks are virtually indestructible. They are capable of slicing through steel beams like butter and are resistant to dulling even after prolonged use. Additionally, these Pokémon are covered with thick, plated armor that shields them from most attacks. Like their pre-evolutions, Haxorus can be very territorial, particularly towards other Haxorus of the same gender. They will engage in fights for control of land, though individual Haxorus are rarely harmed significantly due to their thick armor. Despite this territoriality, Haxorus are actually very docile, even kind, when it comes to others that they do not view as threats. These Pokémon have been known to cut down trees to help smaller Pokémon cross fast-moving rivers or slice open hard Berries and nuts for weaker Pokémon to eat. In battle, Haxorus can use a number of physical Dragon-type attacks to batter foes. In addition to standard moves like Outrage and Dragon Claw, Haxorus can also use their two blades to execute techniques like Dual Chop against enemies. Oddly, Haxorus will lick up dirt from the ground in order to obtain minerals to strengthen their tusks.","A Cubchoo’s defining characteristic is  the mucus-like substance constantly dripping out of its nose. This substance is actually a molecularly complex, supercooled viscous colloid that serves as the source of their ice powers. By sucking this substance back into their noses, Cubchoo can freeze water within their bodies to utilize in Ice-type attacks. Cubchoo will spread the snot on enemies to chill them and slow them down; they are also known to do this to people and Pokémon they dislike. Like mucus, Cubchoo “snot” consists primarily of water and glycoproteins in addition to the chemicals that give it its supercooling properties. Glycoproteins are what give both mucus and Cubchoo snot their characteristic viscosity; when Cubchoo are sick, they produce fewer of these thickening glycoproteins, making their snot less sticky and more watery than usual. This consequently also makes their Ice-type attacks weaker.  Thus, trainers can easily discern the health of their Cubchoo based on the viscosity of their this substance; thick and sticky snot that holds together well indicates healthy Cubchoo, while thin and runny snot indicates ill ones.","Beartic inhabit icy caves and glaciers, particularly those near northern polar oceans and seas. They spend most of their time on four limbs, though they will stand bipedally in order to intimidate foes or reach higher ground. Beartic are capable of exhaling air at subzero temperatures, freezing the surrounding moisture. They use this ability to encase their paws and mouths with claws and fangs of ice, respectively, to attack foes. To cross large stretches of ocean, these Pokémon will freeze the waters beneath their paws, creating pathways of ice for them to walk on. They are also adept swimmers that spend much of their time hunting in the water; when tired, they will simply freeze the water beneath them to rest, creating new ice floes. With their thick fur and wide paws, Beartic are adapted to moving and living in icy environments. They are often the focus of studies regarding changes in global temperatures because of how heavily they depend on large expanses of ice. A warming climate has caused many scientists to focus closely on the Beartic population, which has been slowly but steadily dropping every year.","Cryogonal are made nearly entirely of ice crystals. Unlike normal ice, however, their bodies undergo sublimation from gas to solid and deposition from solid to gas, completely skipping a liquid form in either direction. Cryogonal are unable to control these transformations; if their body temperatures drops below 32°F (0°C), the freezing point of water, they will assume a solid form, and if they are above that point, they will become gaseous. Trainers can give their Cryogonal the same anti-melting “medicine” many Ice-types are treated with in order to raise their melting points considerably, though these Pokémon still dislike heat. Because of they can seemingly appear from thin air in cold weather, some believe that Cryogonal are born in snow clouds; many of them suddenly appear alongside snow as the air temperature drops. Cryogonal hunt by ensnaring prey in chains of ice released from their mouths that reach -148°F (-100°C), freezing them in seconds. They then pull their victims back in to consume them.","Shelmet live in wetlands and fens; Karrablast are almost always found in the same habitats as Shelmet. Karrablast are the main “predators” of Shelmet, if one could call them that. Most attackers are unable to pierce the thick shells of these Pokémon, but Karrablast horns are adapted to pry their fragile bodies out from their armor. In fact, Karrablast must they steal the shells of Shelmet in order to evolve. Similarly, Shelmet that have lost their shells to Karrablast while simultaneously being stimulated with electrical energy—for example, a trade—will evolve into Accelgor. Shelmet tend to be vey cautious and aversive towards novel stimuli, however, so they will often attempt to flee from Karrablast despite needing them for evolution. To deter attackers, Shelmet can spit a sticky, poisonous substance that adheres to and irritates skin upon contact. They will then close their shells to protect their vulnerable bodies from damage. These Pokémon can sometimes be found buried beneath the mud to avoid aggressors.","If a Shelmet has its armor stolen by a Karrablast while both Pokémon are stimulated electrically, then the Shelmet will evolve into an Accelgor. Without heavy shells weighing them down, Accelgor are very fast and agile; however, they also are rather frail, as they have lost their main form of protection as well. These Pokémon live in wetland areas and need to keep moist to prevent their skin from drying out. To facilitate this, Accelgor wrap their bodies in mucus-soaked membranes that help them stay moisturized. A thirsty Accelgor will be weak, clumsy, and even more fragile than usual. Despite their lack of legs, Accelgor can move very quickly, looking as if are soaring through the air when they attack. They strike with lightning-fast, ninja-like movements that can leave opponents dazed before they even realize what hit them. In addition to these physical techniques, Accelgor are also capable of spitting poison like their pre-evolutions. They use a combination of both of these abilities in order to hunt effectively in the wild. Accelgor are especially popular characters in media aimed at young boys.","Travelers in wetlands and marshes should always be wary of Stunfisk. These Pokémon lurk on the muddy beds of stagnant bodies of water, waiting for victims to step on top of them. When they sense pressure, Stunfisk will let loose paralyzing jolts of electricity to immobilize targets and hopefully cause them to fall and drown. The muscles responsible for releasing electricity are also connected to their jaw muscles, causing these Pokémon to express what many perceive as sadistic smiles upon successfully shocking victims. Stunfisk are capable of withstanding enormous amounts of pressure on their bodies; they can support the full weight of a sumo wrestler on top of themselves. These Pokémon do not intentionally attack humans, but they will shock them regardless if stepped upon. If a Stunfisk attempts to shock something that cannot be paralyzed (for example, a fellow Ground-type Pokémon or a hiker in rubber boots), it will swim and flop away with a surprising amount of speed and agility. Recent studies have shown that Stunfisk in fact generate electricity with the aid of microorganisms that live alongside them in the mud, who then inhabit their electrogenic organs. Stunfisk hatched and raised in sterilized mud are unable to produce electricity. ","Mienfoo attack with flurries of quick, constant slashes. They can unsheathe sharp claws from their paws to lacerate foes. These Pokémon excel in executing precise combos of hits to take down enemies before they even have a chance to react. Though each individual strike in a chain of attacks is weak on its own, the combined damage from such combos altogether is enough to overwhelm most opponents. Mienfoo rely heavily on maintaining concentration in order to properly execute their attacks. When particularly focused, the combos of these Pokémon become more accurate and powerful. Conversely, however, an inattentive Mienfoo will often miss blows and fail to hit its opponents in critical areas. Mienfoo can be distracted by a variety of different stimuli, including loud noises, sudden and unexpected movements, or even the smell of food when hungry. They will become angry when disturbed, but this irritation often further disrupts their focus. These Pokémon train in packs on high mountains where such disturbances are rare in order to hone their concentration, where they can be spotted slowly transitioning between a series of poses. There are slight differences in fighting style between Mienfoo packs.","Mienshao are peaceful Pokémon that prefer to avoid conflict whenever possible. However, they are incredibly skilled fighters that can take down most foes with ease. Mienshao fight using the long fur hanging off of their arms as whips to lash continuously and repeatedly at foes in lightning-fast combos that can knock out opponents in mere seconds. When attacking, these whips often move so quickly that they cannot be seen by the human eye. Mienshao are incredibly focused; when they begin combos of precise whipping and kicking, nothing is able to stop them from completing them. They will build up strength over the course of smaller hits before delivering powerful finishing strikes. These blows are also incredibly accurate, striking opponents at vulnerable weak points on their bodies. Mienshao are honorable fighters that do not attack unless they are hit first or are defending weaker Pokémon. They never use any more force than necessary to incapacitate aggressors and will back down from fights they know they cannot win. When angered, they will emit a bizarre wailing  sound before beginning their assault. Mienshao take great care of and pride in their long, thick fur, dedicating much of their time when not training to grooming this fur.","Druddigon are ectothermic (cold-blooded) Pokémon that spend most of their time underground. These Pokémon build their lairs in the abandoned tunnels of Dugtrio, Onix, and Excadrill, darting through complex networks of caves and burrows with surprising speed. They use their sharp claws to hunt prey and rely on their rough, rocky skin (particularly on their ruddy faces) to protect themselves from intruders. Druddigon will lie patiently in waiting for hapless prey to wander into their lairs. Then, they will charge headfirst through their narrow tunnels to take their victims down. Because they are unable to regulate their own body temperatures, Druddigon must periodically sunbathe in order to regain heat. Their wings, with their broad surface area and ability to lay nearly flat against the backs of these creatures, are specially adapted to maximize the amount of heat absorbed from sunlight. These wings are useless for flight and are primarily used for this purpose. If Druddigon are unable to stay sufficiently warm, their muscles will begin to stiffen and become as hard as stone, rendering them unable to move. For this reason, Druddigon will dig holes periodically into the ceilings of their tunnels to allow for easy access to sunlight.","Golett are mysterious Pokémon that are most often found in ancient ruins and vaults. They were first discovered by archaeologists excavating a buried temple in Unova. Analysis of their body compositions have found that these Pokémon are made primarily of a substance that is strikingly similar to clay, particularly that of the pottery often found in the ruins that Golett inhabit. Additionally, carbon dating has traced individual, living Golett back nearly 2,000 years—again, roughly the same amount of time as the earthenware they were found with. The ages, composition, and habitats of Golett have left many scientists befuddled as to their origins. Some more “creative” scientists have speculated that Golett were once inanimate clay statues, brought to life by the lost technological methods of an ancient civilization to defend the society from harm. These creatures seem to compulsively line up nearby boulders into neat rows, forming precise geometric patterns. Some say they are following their ancient masters' orders to build walls or geoglyphs. One final mystery regarding Golett is their energy sources, which are located within their torsos. This energy glows brightly when the Pokémon attack; to this day, no one has been able to identify exactly what it is. Because of their age, scientists hypothesize that unless their energy is somehow infinite, Golett must run out of energy at some fixed point in time, either in the near or distant future. ","Like Golett, Golurk can be found in the ruins of past civilizations, standing guard in old vaults or patrolling decaying hallways. Some believe that these Pokémon were crafted from clay by ancient people and Pokémon in order to protect their cities; they follow orders unwaveringly and unceasingly until told to do otherwise. Ruins of ancient fortresses sport artillery platforms believed to be perches for defending Golurk to fire attacks from. Though it may not seem like it, Golurk are capable of flight; they can reach Mach speeds by pulling their arms and legs into their bodies and expelling their internal energy to propel themselves like rockets across the sky. They can create sonic booms in this manner upon breaking the sound barrier. The mysterious energy inside these Pokémon appears to be infinite, though this has yet to be proven—Golurk can fly for extremely long periods of time without eating or even tiring. Indeed, this energy appears to be so powerful that their bodies can barely contain it; almost all known Golurk have cracks running across their torsos that indicate this energy attempting to escape, held back by seals patching the seams shut. Some believe that removing these seals will cause Golurk to release all of their energy at once, leading to disastrous results. According to legend, removing a Golurk's seal is the only way to stop it from following it's master's orders, though the Pokémon will also begin to rampage uncontrollably as a result.","Pawniard prowl around in packs on rocky badlands and highlands. They are always led by a single Bisharp to which they are entirely subservient. These Pokémon essentially exercise no judgement on their own; they only act when commanded to do so by their Bisharp. Pawniard viciously attack foes using the many blades on their bodies. They will latch onto their victims by jumping onto them and sinking their torso blades into their flesh before swinging their hands and heads around to further slice foes. They will clang their blades together following a successful strike. While a single Pawniard alone can do significant harm to a foe, the work of a pack can easily be fatal to unprotected opponents. Pawniard do not react to their own injuries or wounds, as they are entirely occupied in taking down the victims their Bisharp have selected. These Pokémon will sharpen their blades on river rocks when they dull; this can be an arduous process, given the number of blades they possess. Each Pawniard has its favorite sharpening stone, and will become quite upset if it is touched or otherwise moved. If the Bisharp leader of a pack goes missing, the strongest Pawniard of the pack will be quickly promoted to leader by evolving. Though they would never dream of betraying their leader, individual Pawniard in a pack will train tirelessly to achieve this spot should their Bisharp ever fall.","Bisharp are merciless Pokémon that are almost always found surrounded by a pack of Pawniard. They command their Pawniard to savagely maim prey, but will always deliver the finishing blows to victims; they will not even blink when doing so. Though completely capable of overwhelming and taking out foes much larger than themselves, packs of Pawniard will cease to attack opponents once they are rendered immobile so that their leader Bisharp can finish them off. There can only be one Bisharp in a pack; if a Pawniard in a pack evolves, it will have to fight the leading Bisharp for control of the the group. Losers are exiled and left pack-less, forced to roam in search of stray Pawniard to recruit (or another Bisharp with Pawniard to duel). Bisharp demand strict obedience from their Pawniard and are ruthless in retribution if crossed. Bisharp whose head blades are chipped will retire permanently and become lone hunters, unable to hold command a Pawniard pack. Many urban myths surround these Pokémon, warning that they order their Pawniard to practice their hunting skills on unsuspecting human and Pokémon travelers in the mountains at night. While these cautionary tales are present wherever Bisharp are, there have been no confirmed cases of such an event ever occurring to date. Bisharp often compete with Fraxure for choice sharpening stones near rivers.","Bouffalant are short-tempered Pokémon that have the tendency to charge at the slightest provocation. They can be found roaming plains and savannas in herds. Once an endangered Pokémon, continued conservation efforts have greatly increased the number of Bouffalant in the wild. Bouffalant herds are territorial; they will break into stampedes when intruders draw near as they all attempt to charge at the invaders at once. The thick tuft of fur on a Bouffalant’s head is incredibly shock-absorbent, allowing it to headbutt with enough force to derail a train without feeling any significant knockback. This fur is also a symbol of dominance among Bouffalant. Individuals with the largest and most luxurious head fur have the first choice of mates during breeding season and are the first to graze if food is scarce. Interestingly, these Pokémon also respond to similar-looking hair among other beings, including humans. Herds charging at travelers have been known to suddenly stop upon noticing that one of the visitors has a particularly voluminous afro.","Rufflet can be found in coniferous forests near wetlands. Though they appear weak, Rufflet are in fact very courageous and resilient. Braviary usually lay three Rufflet eggs at a time, but only the strongest hatchling can catch the attention of its parents with raucous calling and receive food to survive. Slightly older individuals may even challenge their guardians to a fight in order to prove themselves worthy of care. For the first few weeks of their lives, Rufflet are fed by their parents. Afterwards, however, they are pushed out of their nests to forage for food (though they return afterwards). They use their strong talons to grasp and crack hard nuts and Berries as well as peck at prey; they prefer meat and seafood, but they cannot always obtain it easily. Their powerful legs and claws do enable them to crack the carapaces of crustaceans and shellfish, however. While on their own, they must fend for themselves against predators. Rufflet will fearlessly stand their ground against foes much stronger than themselves. They are even known to initiate battles with larger Pokémon when unprovoked (though they will often begin crying if they lose). Rufflet become stronger through this frequent fighting. As they continue to grow, Rufflet will leave their nests for longer and longer periods of time, until one day they simply do not return.","Braviary are symbols of valiance worldwide; this is especially true in Unova, where are the unofficial regional Pokémon and represent patriotism. Alolans also refer to them as “heroes of the sky.” Braviary are aggressive fighters, but they are always motivated by loyalty and kinship. They will battle opponents in spite of danger and pain in order to defend their loved ones. In fact, scars are a sign of dedication among Braviary, and individuals with more front-facing scars are held in higher regard--however, those with many scars on their backs are mocked as cowards. Their talons are very strong and can dig into solid steel. Additionally, Braviary can lift objects as heavy as cars with their talons. Though strong and capable of long-distance flight, their belligerence makes them poor choices for public transportation (a role that Corviknight fills better in regions like Galar). Because of what Braviary represent, their feathers are often used as decorations in a number of traditions. Soldiers wounded while defending their nations in war, for example, are honored with badges depicting stylized crests of Braviary feathers; the number of feathers depends on the extent of the bravery the soldier displayed. It is said that Braviary were once endangered by humans, but fought back to reclaim their land.","Vullaby live in harsh badlands that few other Pokémon can be found in. They cannot fly because their wings are small and underdeveloped. Consequently, they have to resort to other methods of protection; their mothers will gather the skulls of deceased Pokémon for them to use as protection, using larger ones as they grow. Siblings will squabble with one another for comfy bones. Partially due to their voracious appetites, Vullaby undergo multiple growth spurts and require new bones each time, with the old ones being passed on to younger chicks. The bones also protect their rears, as these Pokémon are clumsy and often fall while waddling around. However, they are also heavy, so when Vullaby near evolution and prepare to fly, they will discard their skulls. Vullaby are not picky eaters and will consume whatever their mothers bring back to them or wanders close enough for them to chase. Vullaby almost always try to pursue prey weaker than themselves, sometimes purely for enjoyment; they quickly will give up chase, however. They do not enjoy walking much, so they will only finish hunting down prey when food is scarce. Despite this, they can often be seen hopping excitedly as they try in vain to take flight. Sometimes, a Vullaby may follow its mother out to scavenge or hunt; this is where it learns to discern weakened prey and salvage bones for later use.","Mandibuzz are both scavengers and hunters, often seen circling the skies in desolate badlands. Their use their keen senses of sight and smell to locate weakened or sick prey. When they find food, they will circle around their victims before diving in. Mandibuzz then carry their prey back to their nests. These Pokémon have an affinity for bones, which they collect to decorate their own bodies as well as build their meticulously-crafted nests—ominous-looking piles of bones in badlands are almost invariably abandoned Mandibuzz nests. Many of these bones will invariably be those of Cubone and Marowak, due to their shared penchant for bone-collecting. They will root through carcasses already picked clean of flesh by other scavengers for desirable bones. Mandibuzz (as well as Vullaby) have abnormally strong stomach acids that allow them to consume rotting flesh without becoming ill. These Pokémon are often regarded as omens of death in popular culture; the sight of a Mandibuzz circling overhead in a barren wasteland is a harrowing symbol for tired travelers, indicating that the end is near. Despite their opportunistic natures, these Pokémon are quite maternal and will adopt orphaned Vullaby from other mothers and raise them as their own. Mandibuzz were one thought to adorn bones to attract mates, but it is now it is more commonly believed that they serve simply as protection. Still, populations Mandibuzz do seem to observe some form of \"fashion trends\" when it comes to bones, with different types and methods of adornment falling in and out of style over time.","Heatmor can be found in tropical rainforests rooting about the undergrowth in search of their favorite prey, Durant. Heatmor and Durant are famous for being prime examples of co-evolution and the evolutionary “arms race.” Scientists believe that Heatmor did not always breathe fire—rather, they evolved to do so when their prey Durant evolved steel exoskeletons. Heatmor breathe through holes in their tails. To attack, they pass some of the air they inhale through a special organ in their bodies that combusts the oxygen in the air, allowing the Pokémon to spew out flames. If these organs clogs up, then Heatmor will quickly fall ill from a lack of sufficient airflow. The insides of a Heatmor are constantly burning, much like a furnace. The tubular structures that run across a Heatmor’s torso facilitate the flow of air within their bodies for respiration and combustion. Heatmor can also spew smoke out of their tails to create diversions against opponents. When hunting, Heatmor use their flaming “tongues” to snake through Durant colonies and melting right through their prey’s metallic exoskeletons with ease--though they still must watch out for their powerful mandibles.","Durant live in large colonies in the dirt of tropical rainforests and the sides of mountains. These underground colonies consist of complex, interconnected tunnels that allow for fast access to many different areas of their territories. Their fearsome jaws can snap the bones of victims much larger than themselves, while their hard steel armor is difficult for most foes to penetrate. Their mandibles are strong enough to crush stone, helping them dig tunnels with ease. In a colony, each Durant has a specific task—gathering food, protecting the hive, or raising young, for example. Even in certain tasks there are further divisions, such as gathering food only from certain quadrants of land. When their colonies are threatened, Durant will lay down their lives to defend their egg-laying queens (there is only one in a colony). Their main predators are Heatmor, who scientists believe evolved the ability to spew fire solely to consume Durant. Other species, such as Sandaconda, also enjoy feasting on Durant eggs. Durant work together to defend their colonies against Heatmor, strategically blocking certain areas of with damp mud and leaves and biting their attackers in particularly vulnerable areas.","Deino live in deep caves where little to no light penetrates. Because they live in total darkness, these Pokémon have little use for sight; consequently, they are functionally blind. Though they still have eyes on their heads, they are severely underdeveloped and almost always covered by fur. Unlike some other troglobites, however, Deino do not have particularly acute senses of smell, hearing, or even taste to make up for their lack of vision. They wander aimlessly about caverns, tackling and biting randomly in hopes of knocking down or injuring unwary prey. Deino will often tackle at nothing, or conversely, headbutt straight into cavern walls or boulders. They are usually covered in wounds because of this behavior. Deino are a very hardy species that can withstand many injuries. They are also not very picky eaters; if they tackle anything that even appears to be moving, they will attempt to consume the object or creature in question. However, if they do chomp on something they like, they will develop a strong association between what they are currently smelling and what they are tasting. If their poor senses of smell detect the same odor again, these Pokémon will begin snapping ferociously all about. Carelessly approaching wild Deino is a poor idea because of their tendencies to ram about and try to bite anything moving.","Like Deino, Zweilous are functionally blind because their eyes are underdeveloped. They utilize a haphazard “hunting” method similar to that of their pre-evolutions. By tackling into thin air and biting viciously at seemingly-random, Zweilous hope to catch nearby victims off-guard. The hard skulls and strong jaws of each of their heads make quick work of most prey. Zweilous are absolutely voracious eaters that virtually never stop hunting. They will “search” for food in one area and attempt to completely clear it of anything that is moving before simply wandering to another area ​and doing the same. Their heads even compete with each other for food; the heads that manage to eat more become the leaders of the pairs and are able to pick which direction to wander into in search of more food. The only thing that Zweilous appear to do nearly as much as look for food is bicker amongst themselves; their two heads can commonly be seen attacking each other in vicious arguments. Zweilous will often bear more scars from themselves than from outside attackers.","Hydreigon are widely regarded as some of the most brutal, ruthless Pokémon in existence. They scour caves and highlands, attacking and consuming anything and everything they can see moving; luckily, their poor eyesight allows for smaller, faster, or smarter prey to avoid detection from these voracious Pokémon rather easily. Hydreigon have three heads, each with their own functioning tracheas and esophagi. However, the two on either side of the center heads lack brains. As Zweilous, the two heads of these Pokémon competed for dominance and food; the “dominant” heads become the central heads upon evolution while the others wither away and becomes hand-like appendages for the Pokémon. Despite the lack of a brain in either head, Hydreigon can still use these heads to eat and breathe. They will wield all three mouths in tandem to viciously and relentlessly bite foes until they have fallen. Hydreigon are popular opponents in the mythology in many regions; oftentimes, the heroes of regional legendary epics have to battle and defeat a rampaging Hydreigon in a demonstration of strength and courage.","Larvesta make their homes at the feet of dormant and active volcanoes. They can be found nestled in crags of hardened lava, warmed by the heat of the magma underneath. Larvesta are voracious eaters that feast on plants growing in the nearby rich, volcanic soil. The five horns protruding from their heads can each spew flames reaching up to 5,500°F (3,000°C) to protect Larvesta from predators; these horns are also usually very hot, sometimes glowing from the heat and further deterring opponents from bothering these Pokémon. Because the arrangement of a Larvesta’s horns somewhat resembles rays of sunlight, many cultures connect these Pokémon with the sun. Traditional folklore holds that Larvesta are somehow born from the power of the sun, an idea that stems from the mythology of older ancient cultures. A popular variant purports that Larvesta in fact nest on the sun's surface. When Larvesta near evolution, they will use their horns to cloak themselves in flames as “cocoons” of sorts. When the flames dissipate, they emerges as Volcarona. The evolution of a Larvesta was regarded as a sacred event in the past, depicted in many ancient wall carvings.","Volcarona are almost never seen in the wild; in ancient civilizations of regions like Unova, they were worshipped as deities. Translated tablets and wall carvings found in the Relic Castle of Unova detail a myth in which, after a disastrous volcanic spewed out enough ash to blot out the sun, a (though the stories refer to the Pokémon with a singular “the”) Volcarona appeared in the sky and “replaced” the sun, providing light for the people and Pokémon below. Another, more modern tale regarding these Pokémon has them appearing to freezing travelers in the winter to provide them with warmth. In a few regions, though, the mythology is somewhat darker; in Alola for instance, Volcarona is feared and referred to as \"the rage of the sun.\" Today, Volcarona continue to be famous symbols of the sun—in particular, their six wings are often used to symbolize the sun in contemporary artwork. In battle, Volcarona can create fields of flames simply by flapping their wings, shedding trails of shimmering, ember-like scales that set the ground ablaze. The sight of these scales fluttering in the air has been described as “breath-taking” and “mesmerizing” by those who are blessed enough to see it firsthand.","Cobalion is one of the fabled Swords of Justice; it is regarded as the leader of the group as well as its original member. Along with the other Swords of Justice, Cobalion fights to defend wild Pokémon from the actions of humans—the destruction of natural habitats, cruel hunting of Pokémon for sport, and abuse of wild Pokémon are all problems that Cobalion and its allies work together to combat. Cobalion is famed for its composed demeanor. It is said to have a heart and body of steel, with its gaze capable of coercing those around it to obey its commands. Compared to the other three members of the Swords of Justice, Cobalion seems to be the most distrustful of humans. It also appears to never show emotion, unlike its more expressive comrades. People lucky enough to spot the Sword of Justice together, however, have reported that Cobalion appears to have a special affinity for the group’s youngest member, Keldeo. Many legends regarding the Swords of Justice portray Cobalion as Keldeo’s adopted father of sorts.","Terrakion is a member of the Swords of Justice. Physically, it is the strongest Pokémon in the group. Many legends emphasize how Terrakion is capable of destroying an entire castle wall or fortress in a single blow. Unova legend tells of how long ago, during a war amongst two disputing groups of humans (likely the very same war in which Reshiram and Zekrom emerged), Terrakion and the two other Swords of Justice at the time, Cobalion and Virizion, fought to protect innocent Pokémon caught in the crossfire. Though rarely sighted today, many believe that the Swords of Justice still fight to protect all wild Pokémon from the actions of humans. In literature, Terrakion is often depicted as being less perceptive and more impulsive than its fellow Swords of Justice, sometimes causing problems for the other members because of this; however, its loyalty and dedication to its allies as well as its unrivaled compassion for the small and weak are often praised as some of its most noble traits. In most stories, Terrakion is the second member to join the Swords of Justice, partnering with its leader Cobalion. ","As a member of the Swords of Justice, Virizion fights to defend Pokémon from human actions. It is extremely agile, using the horns on its head—which are are sharp as knife blades—to take opponents by surprise, slicing them with a whirlwind-like flurry of attacks. Along with Cobalion and Terrakion, Virizion protected wild Pokémon from being injured during a human war long ago. In literature, Virizion is generally thought to be the final Pokémon to join the original Swords of Justice (thus, the third overall); many stories depict it as initially ambivalent about its allies and hesitant to fully embrace its role in the Swords of Justice. However, such tales always reveal in some way or another that Virizion truly does care about its companions, but simply does not enjoy expressing it. Some works give Virizion a particularly close kinship with Terrakion within the Swords of Justice. When Keldeo joins the group in most versions of the myth, Virizion is at first the most hesitant about the new member, but eventually grows closer to the protégé.","Tornadus is known as the bringer of winds; its presence is heralded by powerful gales and gusts. This Pokémon is said to be able to summon tornadoes and windstorms strong enough to blow away entire houses. Because of this, people of many cultures, particularly agricultural ones, fear Tornadus and have developed a number of different traditions thought to help keep it away from their homes. In its Incarnate Forme, its lower body is cloaked in a mysterious cloud that generates incredible energy, which it channels with its tail to unleash winds. Tornadus can fly in the air at a speed of 200 mph (300 km/h). In mythology, Tornadus and Thundurus both soar across the world to wreak havoc with their storms. They are only calmed down by the Pokémon Landorus, who punishes them for their troublemaking. Tornadus’s humanoid form is thought to be merely a disguise for its true appearance—a mysterious item known as the Reveal Glass is said to be able to allow those who peer through it to examine Tornadus in its true Incarnate Forme.","In mythology, Thundurus is referred to as the bringer of lightning. The cloud surrounding its lower body in its Therian Forme generates a spectacular amount of electrical energy, which it concentrates in its tail and then fires as lighting bolts through the spikes on its tail. Thundurus is always accompanied by clouds of lighting; it leaves swathes of charred land behind in its wake. Forest fires often break out shortly after this Pokémon is sighted. This Pokémon enjoys causing havoc with Tornadus, traveling across the world and bringing great storms along with them. Landorus is thought to be the only being capable of calming Tornadus and Thundurus down. Agricultural societies have developed superstitions based around warding the pair away from their villages. According to legend, the humanoid form Thundurus is often depicted in—its Therian Forme—is not its true image. Instead, it has another guise that is not readily visible to most beings. An item known as the Reveal Glass is said to allow those who look through it to see Thundurus in its Incarnate Forme.","In Unova mythology, Unova was founded by two brothers and a Dragon-type Pokémon. When the brothers fought over their beliefs in either truths or ideals, the dragon split in two; Reshiram is said to be the Pokémon of truth who sided with the older brother. The brothers fought, but were evenly matched. They eventually called a truce, but their sons rekindled the conflict, leading to Reshiram and Zekrom ravaging the region with fire and lightning before disappearing. Reshiram’s tail can flare up with intensely hot fire that can warm up the surrounding air and cause changes in the weather. As the dragon of truth, Reshiram supports those who display worldliness, practicality, and the desire for objective answers. Just as the older brother of Unova legend did, Reshiram seeks to create a world founded upon the search for absolute truths. It is said that Reshiram will appear to those passionate in searching for truths and aid them in their quests; however, if they stray from this path and choose to lie for personal gain, Reshiram will burn everything around it before disappearing.","Zekrom is said to have been created during an ancient Unova war. According to legend, the two brothers that founded Unova disagreed about the future of the region—the older brother sought truth while the younger brother pursued ideals. During the conflict that broke out in the region between them, the Dragon-type Pokémon aiding them split in two; Zekrom sided with the ideal-seeking younger brother. The sons of the brothers continued the conflict despite their fathers calling a truce, leading Reshiram and Zekrom to destroy the region and then disappear. Zekrom’s tail functions a powerful generator, enabling it to discharge earth-scorching lightning. As the dragon of ideals, Zekrom aids those who pursue achievement, perfection, and personal beliefs. It desires to form a world based on striving for elusive ideals. In legends, Zekrom is said to appear to people who demonstrate strong personal convictions and faiths and help them pursue these beliefs. It will destroy its surroundings and vanish if they end up betraying their own ideals, however.","Landorus is revered in agricultural societies as the “Guardian of the Fields.” This Pokémon can let loose vibrant energy from its tail that fertilizes the earth beneath with minerals and nutrients. As Landorus flies over fields of crops, it enriches the soil and ensures bountiful harvests. Farmers often pray to Landorus in hopes that it will visit their fields in order to ensure abundance. In addition to helping crops grow, Landorus also aids in stopping the Pokémon Tornadus and Thundurus from wreaking havoc with storms while together. According to mythology, Landorus will break up the pair and punish them if they come too close to each other, as their combined powers would form a catastrophic storm. In images, Landorus is most often depicted in its humanoid Incarnate Forme. It is thought that this is not Landorus’s true appearance, but merely the form that most people and Pokémon can see. Its real form, its Therian Forme, can only be viewed by gazing through a mysterious artifact known as the Reveal Glass.","Kyurem is a prominent figure of Unova mythology. According to myth, Unova was founded through the work of two brothers and a single Dragon-type Pokémon. However, the siblings began to quarrel over their goals; the fight eventually led to a war, and the Pokémon aiding them split in two—Reshiram and Zekrom. Kyurem is thought to be the empty husk left behind, longing to be whole again. It froze itself in ice in order to keep its feeble body from decaying. In Lacunosa Town, Unova, Kyurem is said to have arrived upon an icy meteor that landed near the town, creating the Giant Chasm. Residents believe that it roams around at night to eat locals, so they have built walls around the town and stay indoors after dark. Aside from this local myth, most believe that Kyurem indeed is the “original dragon” of legend. It can generate freezing air and energy, but it is said that the leaking of this energy caused it to freeze itself. No one has seen Kyurem’s whole form, though the group Team Plasma is said to have successfully fused either Reshiram or Zekrom with it. It is said that Kyurem lies waiting for a hero with truth or ideals and complete it.","Keldeo is a member of the Swords of Justice. It is regarded as the group’s most recent member—most historians date its acceptance into the group as some time shortly after the human war in which the original three members defended wild Pokémon. Keldeo can shoot water from its hooves to propel itself; it uses this technique to “run” across bodies of water and jump high distances. Because of its affinity for clean water, it is often seen near scenic lakefronts. Keldeo excels at using in its hind legs in attacks. According to legend, the veteran Swords of Justice adopted Keldeo as a protégé of sorts. Their leader, Cobalion, developed a particularly close bond with Keldeo. One day, Keldeo mysteriously ran away from the group to pursue its own path, becoming stronger than the other members. When they crossed paths again, Keldeo reaffirmed its place in the Swords of Justice; its former mentors taught him the move Secret Sword, which allowed it access newfound determination and enter its stronger Resolute Form. According to legend, it was only through many trials and tribulations that Keldeo was able to fully develop its horn and transform.","Meloetta is revered by artists across the world for its beautiful singing and dancing. It has inspired countless pieces of artwork, songs, and dances. According to legend, Meloetta once travelled the world performing beautiful music and dancing that filled people with incredible joy. However, as the world grew increasingly cynical and less appreciative of the arts, it began to lose its voice and its dance, symbolized in many folk songs and paintings by a pair of ruby-red shoes. Meloetta then seemed to largely disappear for a period of time. Musicians and singers began to play Meloetta’s signature melody, known as the Relic Song, to remind Meloetta wherever it was of the music it had once enchanted people with, allowing it to appear again. Today, artists play the Relic Song to attract Meloetta in hopes of being blessed with a stroke of ingenuity. Meloetta’s vocalization method can control the moods of those around it. By singing the Relic Song, it can switch between its song-based Aria Forme and its dance-based Pirouette Forme.","Genesect is a mysterious, artificial Pokémon designed in the P2 Laboratory of Unova and commissioned by the notorious Team Plasma. It was based on an unknown prehistoric species from over 300 million years ago—likely a Kabutops or a close relative, based on its physical appearance. In addition to a new, metallic exoskeleton and upgraded firepower, Team Plasma also attached a modifiable cannon to Genesect’s back. Based on a number of different, interchangeable Drives that can be inserted into the cannon, the type of Genesect’s attack Techno Blast can be changed; its LED light also changes color to reflect this. By tucking in its limbs and its cannon, Genesect can fly like an aircraft. For a long time, virtually no one—including Team Plasma—knew of Genesect’s existence. This is because the organization’s then-perceived leader, “N”, decommissioned the project based on personal beliefs regarding genetic engineering. However, a single scientist continued to work on the Genesect Project, in secret, until its completion.","Chespin are one of three Pokémon that trainers starting their journeys in the Kalos region can choose from. They are inquisitive Pokémon that enjoy exploring their surroundings. They are sometimes careless while wandering, however, and can unknowingly put themselves in danger. The spines on top of a Chespin’s head are normally soft and pliable; when threatened, though, these Pokémon can quickly stiffen their quills so that their needle-like tips are sharp enough to pierce rocks. The coverings on their heads are made of wood, allowing them to withstand a headfirst collision with a truck without suffering any lasting damage. Chespin are cheerful and resilient Pokémon that are quick to regain their spirits even in the face of troubles and difficulties. In fact, they will often try their best to cheer up their friends—their trainers included—after lost battles and other similar events. Unsurprisingly, trainers in Kalos often choose Chespin for their uplifting optimism as well as their hardiness in battle.","Quilladin are peaceful Pokémon that can be found in the grasslands and fields of Kalos (though they are quite rare in the wild). They never start conflicts with other Pokémon, even when resources are scarce. These Pokémon would rather starve than take food from another hungry creature. If attacked, Quilladin will defend themselves with their hard shells and sharp spines; however, they won’t attempt to counter-attack their aggressors. Quilladin shells are made of hard wood that can deflect the attacks of most enemies; their carapaces and sharp spines successfully deter most predators from even attempting to harm them. Quilladin live in small groups of about six or so individuals. Members of a group tend to be very close to one another. In their spare time, Quilladin will run into one another at high speeds in order to strengthen their lower bodies. Groups of Quilladin have been known to work together in order to defend smaller and weaker Pokémon from predators by surrounding them to create tough walls of quills.","Upon evolution into Chesnaught, trainers will realize that despite their imposing appearances, these Pokémon are just as kind-hearted as they were as Chespin. Chesnaught are extremely sturdy Pokémon—a tackle from one can overturn a 50-ton tank. By linking their arms in front of their faces, these Pokémon can fuse their forearms together to use Spiky Shield, a defensive technique that protects them from virtually any attack. They can easily withstand the explosion of a bomb in this manner. Chesnaught will not hesitate to use their bodies, which are shielded by spiked, wooden carapaces, to protect smaller and weaker Pokémon from attacks. In battle, they will defend their allies in this manner; there have even been many recorded cases of Chesnaught shielding their trainers from rockslides, explosions, and other dangers with their resilient bodies. Given their sturdiness and selflessness, it is no wonder that so many trainers in Kalos end up raising Chesnaught as their starter Pokémon.","Trainers in Kalos have the option of selecting Fennekin as their starter. Pokémon. Many who choose these Pokémon for their cuteness are surprised by their bouts of moodiness—Fennekin are known to be rather unpredictable in their personalities, being easygoing at one moment yet irritable at another. Despite their temperamental tendencies, however, these Pokémon always try their absolute best in battle and hate disappointing their trainers. Fennekin dispel excess heat through their ears, which can warm the air passing through them to over 390°F (200°C). These Pokémon have a curious diet—they subsist primarily on dry twigs, which they seek out constantly, even chewing on them while walking about. They combust the sticks they eat within their bodies to create fire. To intimidate foes, Fennekin will puff out hot air from their ears, causing the tufts of fur in them to glow faintly. Despite their occasional mood swings, their cuteness and determination make Fennekin popular amongst Kalos trainers.","When Fennekin evolve into Braixen, they stop eating sticks as their primary source of nutrition--in fact, Braixen are no longer incapable of digesting the cellulose of wood at all. However, these Pokémon still demonstrate an affinity for twigs, keeping on in their tails at all times. These twigs appear to function as security blankets of sorts for Braixen, helping temper the mood swings they experienced as Fennekin. If a Braixen loses its stick, it will become fretful, anxious, and even angry. When Braixen pull their twigs out from their tails, the friction of the action ignites the tips of the sticks, giving them a makeshift torch. They use this burning stick to defend themselves from enemies. Braixen can wave the blazing branch in front of their mouths while breathing fire in order to increase the strength of their flames. Braixen will also use their twigs to communicate with others, which is useful considering these Pokémon are nocturnal. Sticking the twigs back in their flame-resistant tails will put out the flame through oxygen deprivation.​","Trainers are often struck by the considerable changes in personality their Fennekin have undergone once they become Delphox. While Fennekin tend to be temperamental and moody, Delphox are remarkably calm and collected. They retain their dedication to their trainers and drive to perform well that they had as Fennekin, however. Delphox carry wand-like sticks that they can ignite with psychic energy. When not in use, they store these sticks within the tufts of fur on their wrists. Delphox can stare at the fire at the tips of their branches to achieve a heightened state of focus and glance into the future. They can further focus their psychic energy on these flames to utilize the technique Mystical Fire or create flaming vortexes reaching 5,400°F (3,000°C), entrapping and incinerating foes within. Even today, Delphox have remained a popular choice for trainers starting their journeys in the Kalos region because of their impressive grace and composure, both during and outside of battle.","In the Kalos region, trainers starting their journeys can choose Froakie as their starter Pokémon. These carefree creatures may seem to be dull and oblivious, but they in fact are very perceptive and keep a close eye on everything around them. They can leap into action in the blink of an eye, spurred by warning signals most other people and Pokémon wouldn’t even notice. Froakie have strong hind legs that enable them to jump very high. Froakie breathe through their skin, which is rather thin and delicate. To protect themselves, they secrete a coat of bubbles (which many young trainers have dubbed “frubbles”) from their chests and backs. These bubbles are flexible and shock-absorbent, shielding Froakie from the brunt of most attacks. In addition, Froakie also use these bubbles to disguise themselves from attackers, enabling them to analyze their surroundings without being noticed. Kalos trainers who appreciate a mellow yet highly perceptive Pokémon are likely to pick Froakie as their starter of choice.","Frogadier are incredibly agile Pokémon that can be rarely found in the ponds and wetlands of Kalos. Their jumping abilities exceed that of their pre-evolutions, enabling them to leap across trees in the wild or from wall to wall in buildings to confound and confuse opponents with ease. The tips of their fingers and toes are specially adapted to allow them to attach and hang upside-down from ceilings and ascend vertical surfaces; additionally, these pads enable these Pokémon to run across the surface of water. Frogadier can climb 2,000 feet (610 meters) up a tower wall in just under 60 seconds. They often disguise themselves in cloaks of bubbles near the water’s surface as they patiently wait for prey. Frogadier are also skilled in ranged attacks; they are known to coat pebbles in bubbles before throwing to precisely hit targets up to 100 feet (30 meters) away. Frogadier tend to be hit-and-run attackers, blindsiding opponents with swift strikes before darting away and shrouding themselves with foam.","Trainers of Greninja often praise it for its stealth and agility. These Pokémon are capable of using Water Shuriken, shooting stars of highly compressed water fast enough to cleanly slice metal bars in half. Greninja are so swift that they sometimes seem to suddenly disappear and then reappear elsewhere as they move. Greninja will use this to their advantage, confusing foes with their speed before striking. The scarf-like appendages wrapped around the necks of these Pokémon are in fact their tongues. These tongues are prehensile, capable of being lashed like whips. Greninja can sometimes be found hanging upside-down from tree branches or ceilings in the shadows, waiting for unwary foes to approach. They can propel themselves considerable distances by shooting jets of water at the ground beneath them (though they can often jump just as high, if not higher). Their blinding speed and incredible stealth have made Greninja popular starter Pokémon in the Kalos region for years.","Bunnelby have ears that are adapted to digging through dirt, whether it is loose or compacted. These Pokémon are nocturnal, spending much of the day asleep in underground burrows. They use their powerful prehensile ears to quickly shovel long tunnels through dirt. These ears are strong enough to break through thick tree roots that happen to be in their way. Bunnelby are industrious Pokémon that can work for long periods of time, often spending entire nights digging without stopping to rest; they can dig up to 33 feet (10 meters) deep in a single night. They will sometimes dig superfluous tunnels around their burrows as practice to strengthen their ears. These destination-less tunnels also serve to confuse predators that enter their burrows. Particularly hardworking Bunnelby have been known to develop ears strong enough to pulverize stone. Bunnelby primarily feed on the roots of plants that they come across while digging; they will even eat through the hardier roots of trees, using their ears to break the tough roots up into more manageable pieces. Bunnelby also have very sensitive hearing, allowing them to detect predators like Talonflame and Corviknight approaching. As skittish Pokémon, they will quickly duck into their burrows at the first sign of danger.","Diggersby are most easily distinguished by the pair of huge, armlike ears that they sport. These highly-developed, prehensile ears exceed the actual hands of many other Pokémon in both strength and maneuverability. Diggersby are capable of lifting boulders weighing over a ton and remove the same amount of weight in dirt from the ground in no time at all using these appendages. Additionally, these ears can reduce solid bedrock to rubble with successive blows. These features make Diggersby ideal candidates for workers in construction, demolition, and excavation sites. They are often seen alongside Gurdurr and Conkeldurr in urban construction zones, destroying old structures and boulders to make room for the other Pokémon to build. Though they are industrious workers, Diggersby also seem to know the value of leisure as well; they can often be seen lounging around on long breaks after finishing their duties. In the wild, Diggersby build their burrows underground or in rocky mountainsides. The fur on their bellies is exceptional at retaining heat, making it popular for knitting heavy winter clothing.","Fletchling are a common sight for residents of Kalos, as they not only inhabit woodlands and fields but also urban areas as well. They are heard more often than seen; most Kalosians are familiar with their melodic singing. Fletchling are diurnal and are most active in the early morning, when they can often be heard chirping amongst the trees. They communicate with one another with distinctive chirps and intricate movements of their tail-feathers. Their pretty voices, however, are a sharp contrast to their personalities—Fletchling are extremely territorial. They will relentlessly peck foes to drive them away and aren’t afraid to aim for the vulnerable areas of foes (most gruesomely, Fletchling often target the eyes). They are very friendly towards familiar faces, however. Fletchling can wield a select number of Fire-type techniques in battle, such as Flame Charge, but not nearly to the extent that their evolutions can. When excited or frightened, their body temperatures can double as aggressive hormones spike in their blood; this can be enough to cause mild burns in some cases, though trainers in warmer climates sometimes will train their Fletchling to warm to a more cozy temperature for cuddling purposes.","Unlike Fletchling, Fletchinder rarely inhabit urban areas, as they prefer to stake out territories of several miles and fly long distances in the open air of the wilderness. These Pokémon have flame sacs within their bodies that lay dormant most of the time. While hunting or fleeing, however, Fletchinder can exert energy to ignite these sacs and increase their flight speeds; this acceleration is not instant, though, as it takes time for their sacs to reach full blaze. Instead, Fletchinder will gradually speed up as their sacs grow hotter and hotter. Still, some Fletchinder can reach quite impressive speeds even before warming up. In battles, Fletchinder will often spend the first few moments playing defensively as they wait for their flame sacs to heat up before surprising their foes with swift assaults. To hunt, Fletchinder will let loose embers from their beaks that set the grass below on fire, scaring out creatures hiding within. Then, they swoop down to capture and roast the bewildered prey. To prevent their fires from spreading and destroying their future hunting grounds, Fletchinder will blow out their own blazes with gusts of wind after hunting.","Talonflame are fearsome birds of prey that inhabit the skies above open woodlands and fields. Unlike Fletchinder, the flame sacs within Talonflame do not need time to warm up; they are always burning at their maximum temperature. Consequently, however, these Pokémon have to hunt often in order to satiate their raging flames. Talonflame can reach the astonishing speed of 310 mph (500 km/h) while diving to the ground for prey. They also have strong talons and hind limbs, often using their feet to deliver powerful kicks as the killing blows to most prey. Talonflame can let loose showers of embers from the spaces between their feathers (they particularly seem to do so when stressed or excited, such as during intense battles), leaving behind trails of heated air as they soar around. They are aerial fighters that prefer to attack from the sky whenever possible; Talonflame will achieve a high velocity by dive-bombing opponents headfirst before swinging their lower bodies in front of them at the last second to deliver formidable kicks. They almost exclusively hunt smaller avian Pokémon. As Talonflame feathers are fireproof, firefighters in medieval Kalos used to use them to craft fireproof suits.","Though they may appear rather weak and frail, Scatterbug are in fact some of the hardiest Bug-type Pokémon in the world, if not one of the most resilient Pokémon overall. They can be survive in virtually any terrestrial environment, though they normally make their homes in forests. Temperate or tropical, evergreen or deciduous, boreal or xeric—it is probable that Scatterbug inhabit or even thrive in any of these wooded areas. The key to the adaptive success of these Pokémon is the special black powder coating their bodies. This powder is incredibly effective at regulating ​heat, retaining it in cold weather but conducting it away in warmer climates, allowing Scatterbug to withstand a wide range of temperatures. This powder is also mildly poisonous to most other Pokémon (and people), paralyzing the muscles in the regions of contact. Though much research is being done to isolate the thermoregulating substances of this powder from the paralytic chemicals, the exact chemical makeup of the dust remains unknown.","Though not as mobile as their pre-evolutions, Spewpa manage to be even hardier than Scatterbug. In addition to being able to withstand a diverse range of climates, these Pokémon can also endure physical blows as well, retaliating back at assailants with plumes of paralyzing powder. This powder is the same kind that coated them as Scatterbug, and it remains responsible for regulating the body temperatures of these Pokémon. Spewpa conceal themselves within the shadows of thickets and bushes to avoid being disturbed as they wait for evolution. Flying-type Pokémon unaware of their defense mechanisms often try to attack them, though their beaks usually fail to pierce their sturdy bodies. Spewpa will bristle their fur as a warning signal prior to spraying their powder; this fur acts as an irritant against foes who disregard their warnings and touch these Pokémon anyways. It is only if aggressors continue to ignore these signals that Spewpa will spray their paralyzing black powder.","Vivillon are most famous for their incredible diversity in wing patterns, which can vary based on climate, weather, topology, and many other geographical and atmospheric conditions, in some of which correlations with Vivillon patterns have not yet been even researched. It is thought that these patterns help the Pokémon camouflage in their native environments. Despite their diverse range of habitats, these Pokémon all share a need for clean water, which they have an uncanny ability to locate through humidity sensors on their antennae. In popular culture, Vivillon are believed to always follow the season of spring wherever it falls, since they become far more abundant in the springtime than in other seasons; in fact, these Pokémon do not migrate at all, and instead hibernate in sheltered areas through unfavorable seasons. Vivillon shed colorful scales as they fly, the hues of which are determined by the particular Vivillon’s patterns These scales are thought to be able to calm restless and aggressive souls.","Litleo live in prides along with their older relatives. These Pokémon are easily excitable and quick to get into fights with other Pokémon. The tufts of fur on their heads, which many refer to as their manes despite their odd placements, radiate a great deal of heat; they often glow and pulse as a result. The intensity and temperature of light emanating from a Litleo’s mane is indicative of its emotions; the mane will burn hotter and brighter when it is angered or excited, but duller when it is ill or fatigued. Litleo manes tend to glow very bright when their owners are in heated battles as their bodies work to provide as much energy as possible. Young Litleo never stray from their prides, honing their skills by play-fighting with siblings or stalking prey that wander near. Older ones, though, are forced out of their prides to hunt for themselves; when evolved, they may return to their old prides, join separate ones, or, if male, start their own, provided that they can recruit a respectable numbers of females into them. The Litleonid meteor shower is named after these Pokémon.","Pyroar are often called the “kings of the savannas” due to their regal appearances. They live in prides led by the male with the largest mane. Pyroar demonstrate sexual dimorphism, particularly present in the manes of males and females. A Pyroar’s mane can be very hot; these Pokémon can breathe fire reaching temperatures of over 10,000°F (6,000°C), with their manes reaching similar degrees. However, they try to avoid using flames to take down prey unless necessary, as they prefer their meat raw. The males of a Pyroar pride go out on hunts, led by the head male, to bring back food for all of the members. The females stay behind and guard the territory from intruders while caring for younger Litleo. Males rarely get involved in combat unless a significant threat is involved, in which case they will put their lives on the line for their prides. When moving or expanding their territory, Pyroar will announce their presence by using Noble Roar; the fearsome sound warns other Pokémon in the area to desert and cede their land to the encroaching Pyroar pride or else face the consequences. Conflicts between two Pyroar prides over territory always end with large swathes of the savanna being left charred and barren.","Flabébé are some of the smallest and lightest Pokémon in existence. They dwell in fields of wildflowers and in the flowerbeds of gardens. The minute Flabébé are born, they search for a flower to hold onto. These Pokémon appear to be able to distinguish between many different species of similar flowers, and even the flowers of a single plant. When they find a flower they like, they will grasp onto it tightly and never let go of it for the rest of their lives. Flabébé both live in and care for their flowers; somehow, they are able to channel energy from the flowers they hold both to sustain themselves and to harness into attacks. In turn, Flabébé keep their flowers healthy and vibrant by providing them with the sunlight, water, and nutrients that they need. Their crowns are made of pollen, and are said to possess mystical healing properties. Flabébé can sometimes be seen floating carefreely in the breeze. They cannot survive without their flowers, though, as they are unable to obtain the energy they need to feed or fend for themselves alone. Similarly, their blooms (sometimes called “fairy flowers” after being chosen by Flabébé) cannot survive without their help.","When Flabébé evolve into Floette, their flowers grow along with them. Like their pre-evolutions, Floette can be seen floating around flowerbeds and gardens. After evolving, these Pokémon become able to draw energy from all the blooms around them, not just the ones that they hold. In overgrown fields where flowers are allowed to grow freely, Floette are able to unleash surprisingly powerful attacks. While human urbanization has caused such areas to diminish, the construction of artificial gardens and flowerbeds have given Floette new places to dwell in. In return for the energy Floette pull out of flowers, they spend much of their time tending to nearby plants. They invest most of their energy into ensuring that all of the flowers around them bloom; when they come across a wilting flower, they will do everything in their power to restore its vibrancy. These Pokémon are popular in gardens for this reason, where they can be seen caring for planted flowers. It is said that Floette can draw the most strength from flowers that are the most beautiful.​ When a flowerbed blooms, the inhabiting Floette will perform an intricate, elegant dance to celebrate. These Pokémon will hold lifelong grudges against those that destroy their flowerbeds.","As the final forms of Flabébé, Florges represent the pinnacle of the mutualistic relationship between these Pokémon and the flowers that they draw energy from; the Pokémon and the flower have become one upon evolution. Florges are the guardians of beautiful, flower-filled meadows and gardens. They defend their delicate flowerbeds not only from other Pokémon, but also from natural disasters such as wildfires. They can live for centuries, dedicating their lives solely to single gardens. Florges spend much of their time tending to their beautiful flowerbeds. Like their pre-evolutions, these Pokémon draw power from blooms and can become very formidable in large, ornate gardens. Florges are so skilled in horticulture that many people request their help in designing gardens. Historical kings and governors have invited Florges to design intricate flowerbeds for their castles. In recent times, toxic industrial runoff from factories have become a problem for Florges populations, with the toxins leaching into nearby soils and preventing the flowers that these Pokémon and their pre-evolutions need for sustenance from growing. These Pokémon can summon powerful, yet hauntingly beautiful, storms of petals in order to protect themselves and their blooms.","Skiddo are a common sight on rural farms and ranches. They are thought to be the first domesticated Pokémon domesticated by humans, even before the advent of Pokémon training—despite their small size, they are capable of carrying people, supplies, and other Pokémon on their backs for considerable distances. Their docile natures and sturdiness are both characteristics that likely made them prime candidates for early humans to domesticate. Additionally, Skiddo don’t require food; with ample water and sunlight, their leaves can photosynthesize enough energy to sustain them without draining the food stores of human farmers. Even today, many agricultural workers train Skiddo to carry around supplies; these Pokémon are also a common sight at petting zoos and fairs, where they give rides to people and Pokémon. Skiddo have lived alongside humans for so long that they have adapted to their presence; their horns are able to sense the thoughts and emotions of the riders holding them so they know where to go.","Skiddo and Gogoat are believed to be one of the first Pokémon to ever be domesticated; they have been documented as aiding people before the first recorded instance of Pokémon training. Wild Gogoat can be found scaling rocky mountains, which their hooves are specially adapted to climb. They live in herds led by a single individual. These leaders are decided through a series of battles in which they clash horns with one another to establish dominance. These Pokémon tend to be docile and placid, particularly when around humans. Gogoat are far more commonly seen, however, on farms and pastures; some cities, such as Lumiose City, Kalos, also utilize Gogoat as a means of transportation. These Pokémon have adapted to working with humans; in addition to serving as “handlebars” for bipedal, two-handed riders, their horns can also sense the feelings and thoughts of those gripping onto them. This allows Gogoat to ferry people to their destinations without their riders needing to give any explicit instructions.","Pancham are naturally found in bamboo forests, but they will also venture onto rocky mountains from time to time as well. These Pokémon often travel alone, or alongside Pangoro, and avoid seeking help from others. At a young age, Pancham will choose a Pangoro (usually not one of their parents) to apprentice under; they will strive to imitate this Pangoro's every move, learning how to battle and hunt. Pancham try their very hardest to appear threatening and intimidating to all of those around them; they will glare and bare their teeth when confronted to try to unnerve foes, but often end up looking adorable in the process. They may even smile if they lose focus for too long. When their intimidation tactics are not taken seriously, they will become even angrier, and thus even more endearing. Though they won’t openly admit it (and will feign anger after regaining composure), Pancham enjoy being patted on the head; this will cause them to loosen their “menacing” attitudes and break out into smiles. These mischievous Pokémon are virtually always seen chewing on bamboo leaves to look “cool.” These leaves act as pacifiers of sorts; they will become fretful when they cannot find leaves to chew on and may even break down into tears after extended periods of time. Pancham see older Pangoro as role models and strive to imitate them (without their help, of course). If a Pancham following a Pangoro makes a mistake, the Pangoro will take the Pancham's leaf as punishment, saddening it greatly.","In the rural, mountainous regions and bamboo forests where Pangoro dwell, they are hailed as defenders of the weak and helpless. Though they can be very grumpy at times, Pangoro will not tolerate the bullying of smaller Pokémon; they will step in themselves to retaliate against offenders. Their sturdy bodies let them shrug off most direct attacks, while their bulky arms can snap telephone poles in two or send a dump truck flying. When enraged or defending others, Pangoro will enter states of rage, disregarding any injuries of their own to continue bashing down on foes. Their trainers must learn to calm them in these states. These somber Pokémon do not make much noise, instead preferring to send messages through brute force. Indeed, it is their stern attitudes that makes them popular amongst certain groups of trainers. They use the sprigs held in their mouths to detect air currents and sense where their opponents will go. Pangoro get especially passionate about dueling with rival Obstagoon. Unfortunately, their righteous natures have increasingly made them prime targets for fur trappers; by intentionally placing small Pokémon in peril near Pangoro, trappers are successfully able to trigger their berserk states and cause them to wander blindly into traps, a practice that many regions are working hard to curb.","Furfrou are well-known for their thick and luxurious fur, which is so dense that it softens the blows of most physical attacks; Furfrou sometimes don’t even feel lighter hits because of how tightly-packed their fur is. The voluminous quality of Furfrou fur also makes it easy to groom and style. In modern times, many upper-class trainers take their Furfrou to salons to get their fur trimmed and colored into a variety of ornate designs. The Pokémon themselves seem to enjoy the treatment; the trimming removes some of the heavy fur from their bodies and makes them more agile, though they will only allow trusted individuals to trim them. Additionally, Furfrou are often considered haughty Pokémon that take great pride in their physical appearances. It is only fitting that Furfrou were the standard Pokémon of kings in the Kalos region, where they served as the personal guard dogs of rulers. These Furfrou were often treated as royalty themselves, and were fed, bathed, and groomed by servants. This practice, in fact, is likely the root of modern Furfrou styling and grooming. Kalosian aristocrats would invent new fur stylings and compete to create most extravagant and intricate designs.","Espurr prefer to live alone, away from other Pokémon and people (and even fellow Espurr and Meowstic). For this reason, they tend to inhabit abandoned human settlements or the tall grass of fields, where they can remain hidden. These Pokémon are rather quiet and unassuming, saving for their unnerving glares; however, their ears disguise two eye-like psychic organs that can potentially unleash enough energy to obliterate everything around them in a radius of 300 feet (100 meters). Espurr cannot control this power, which is automatically let loose when they raise their ears. Many believe that Espurr are in fact afraid of their own abilities, which is why they live as far away as possible from other forms of life. When frightened, though, Espurr may raise their ears in shock, with devastating results. Many unsubstantiated urban legends have emerged revolving around Espurr, the most prevalent of which entails that staring into their unblinking eyes will allow them to steal one’s soul (which, as of yet, is an unproven claim).","Meowstic exhibit sexual dimorphism, with males being mostly blue and females being primarily white. These Pokémon also attack in different ways, with males tending towards defensive moves and females gravitating towards offensive ones. Upon evolution from Espurr, Meowstic gain full control over their eye-like psychic organs. By unfolding their ears, they can unveil these organs and unleash enough energy to pulverize a 10-ton truck into dust. Meowstic must keep a close eye on their ears and keep them sealed as tight as possible, as even a slight relaxation can allow a significant amount of energy to leak out. Though they have better control of their powers, Meowstic still tend to avoid contact with others in fear of causing unnecessary harm. Their fingertips actually conceal sharp claws. These Pokémon mate for life; females venture out in search for food while males stay behind to care for the young—a notable inversion of traditional gender roles amongst Pokémon, but fitting based upon their varying battle styles. Males tend to be protective and easygoing, while females generally are more aggressive and short-tempered; female Meowstic are known to be vindictive towards those that anger them.","According to popular culture, Honedge are the souls of people slain in past wars who then possessed the swords that they were killed with to become Honedge. This belief also explains why these Pokémon are often found near the ruins of medieval castles, as they are still protecting their old kingdoms. Usually, Honedge remain in their sheathes to prevent their blades from becoming worn and rusted. When attacking, however, they will unsheathe themselves to reveal their sharpened blades, holding their sheathes in their tassels. A slash from a Honedge is believed to not only injure a being physically, but also damage its soul as well. Honedge feed on life energy by wrapping their tassels around a being’s appendage and draining its life force through its cloth; it will feed until its victim is left soulless. In fact, it is believed that the tassels are in fact their true bodies, merely wielding the swords as weapons. A famous Kalos legend involves an opportunistic thief finding and taking a sword on the side of the road, only to find out that it was actually a life-draining Honedge; the tale is intended to teach children to not take what isn’t theirs.","Upon evolution into Doublade, Honedge gain a second sword. The two blades are able to communicate via telepathy and coordinate their attacks to viciously slash opponents twice as efficiently. The sheer speed at which Doublade can slash at makes their attacks nearly impossible to parry for even the most skilled swordsmen. These Pokémon can alternate nimbly between offense and defense to keep opponents on their toes. They will rub their blades together prior to combat in order to unnerve foes with a scraping metallic sound. Like Honedge, Doublade feed by draining the life energy of beings by gripping their limbs with their tassels. The two blades cannot stray far from each other; for an unknown reason, if they are too far away from their plaque, they will fall to the ground as lifeless swords that can only be reanimated if they are somehow re-sheathed. There have been recorded incidents in which each sword of a Doublade had latched onto different beings within the same vicinity, or even both grabbed onto different limbs of the same unfortunate victim. If grabbed by a Doublade, one should run as far away as possible from the plaque, as the blades will not risk losing their own spirits by straying too far.","Aegislash are thought to be able to identify the traits of people by examining their souls. They seek out those who are endowed with qualities of leadership and are said to possess and manipulate them for their own purposes while pretending to serve them. In numerous historical accounts of these Pokémon (who are fortunately very rare in the wild), many of the people they chose to possess became kings and other royal officials later on in life with an astonishing probability. These stories often end with the Aegislash being their own undoing, becoming too greedy and draining their wielders of too much life force, leading to the collapses of the kingdoms they helped create. Some believe that Aegislash controlled entire lineages of royalty, from their crownings to their deposals, a seemingly ludicrous proposition until one considers the numerous depictions of these Pokémon alongside their so-called “masters” in medieval artwork. Trained Aegislash seem to only respect trainers who display signs of leadership themselves. In battle, Aegislash alternate between two forms—in their Blade Formes, they are able to deliver powerful slashes at opponents with their heavy swords, while in their Shield Formes, they can withstand the toughest of blows thanks to their sturdy shields and sprectral barriers.","Spritzee flutter around dense woodlands, feeding on a variety of foodstuffs. While their main diets consists of plant products like Berries, seeds, and flower nectar, they will also eat insects regularly and even scavenge rotting carrion; small flocks of these Pokémon have been known to reduce whole bodies to piles of bones in single feeding sessions. Spritzee also sometimes venture out into open meadows or even rural human settlements if food is plentiful in those areas. They are famous for being able to emit a wide variety of smells based on their diet, storing aromatic compounds in special scent pouches. These can range from pleasant floral scents to disgusting rotten odors. They are thought to use these tantalizing smells to attract insect prey. Spritzee scents were once used as natural perfumes; popular amongst women, fragrance connoisseurs raised Spritzee on specific diets to create particular scents. Royal women carried Spritzee around to give themselves unique aromas. This practice has recently returned into vogue, with more humane policies, as a way to imitate traditional royalty.","Aromatisse consume a variety of different substances and store them within their bodies. Their vast diets include normal edibles like fruits and Berries, odder foods like carrion and insects, and bizarre choices like soap and rotting garbage (Aromatisse appear to attempt to consume anything with a strong or unique odor). These Pokémon then mix particular substances to create scents; each individual Aromatisse has its own unique aroma that is used to identify it amongst its peers. This smell can be overpowering to those with sensitive noses—even trainers of Aromatisse may have difficulty dealing with their strong smells, and companions of these Pokémon may find their olfactory senses dulled over time. Aromatisse devise new scents by mixing different substances, with varying results. In battle, these Pokémon emit a number of differing odors to see which one their opponents despise the most before attempting to overwhelm their senses by unleashing a saturated cloud of that aroma. Their clouds can cause watery eyes, choking, and even fainting due to their sheer, overpowering intensity. They can also emit energizing and calming odors to bolster their allies in combat.","Swirlix are adapted to consume an incredibly high amount of glucose and other sugars, and as such only eat sugary foods like candies and fruits. In fact, they consume so much sugar--up to their own body weights each day--that their bodies have to excrete the excess into their fur as syrupy white strands that renders them always sticky. These Pokémon shed their sugary fur relatively often in small clumps held together by this syrup-like substance. Young children often enjoy picking up and eating the clumps left behind by Swirlix as sugary treats known as “Swirly Floss” (the incredibly high sugar content of the syrup coating the already-sugary fur keeps the clumps free of microbes). Swirlix will also spit out these syrupy strands to entangle and slow predators. Swirlix are able to draw their feet into the fur of their bodies. These Pokémon used to primarily live in woodlands and meadows, where they would feed on fruits, flower nectar, and occasionally Combee honey. In modern times, however, the introduction of mass-produced candy has caused these Pokémon to migrate to urban areas in record numbers. Swirlix that do not consume enough sugar each day will become very irritable and lethargic, a far cry from their normal personalities.","Slurpuff consume just as much sugar as Swirlix—urban individuals have been known to eat sugar cubes by the dozens and directly drink syrups that they find in stores, using their long tongues to reach them. Their fluffy contains a lot of air, making it much lighter than it looks. Slurpuff have incredibly acute senses of smell that, to the best that extensive research could estimate, are a whopping 100 million times more sensitive than that of humans. Slurpuff also have the ability to adjust the sensitivities of various olfactory receptors so that they won’t be overwhelmed by strong scents. When their sharp senses of smell were first discovered, there was much clamor amongst the public to introduce them into sectors like firefighting (to detect smoke even before smoke detectors) or forensics (to track down criminals—though they were not very good at chasing them, which is why Growlithe remain the standard choice). However, Slurpuff are today most often seen with chefs helping bake (and eat) pastries, where both their senses of smell can be utilized and their sweet teeth be satisfied. Recently, scientists have discovered that Slurpuff can detect certain mental and physical illnesses in patients based on changes in their scent; this finding shows much promise for medical diagnostics and is currently being studied avidly by researchers across the world.","Inkay usually inhabit beaches and shallow tide pools, as they prefer to be on land (though they must remain moist at all times). However, Inkay have also been discovered living deep in ocean trenches; it is unknown whether or not terrestrial Inkay dive into the depths of the sea or vice versa. These unassuming Pokémon seem to be rather defenseless at first, making them common targets for inexperienced predators. However, Inkay hold a surprising ability that allows them to escape predation the vast majority of the time; the spots on their mantles can flash with lights, allowing Inkay to influence the minds of all that gaze into them. Though they cannot yet fully manipulate people or other Pokémon, they can sufficiently influence them enough to drain their will to fight. Inkay use this technique to hunt immobile prey with ease by luring them in with lights and then grasping them with their tentacles; they will also use their lights to escape from confused predators. It is believed that Inkay will flash their lights in complex patterns to communicate with one another across distances. Curiously, these Pokémon have a habit of turning themselves upside-down for no apparent reason; some believe this action strengthens their abilities.","Right before evolution into Malamar, Inkay will begin to turn upside-down more often. After a while, they will turn-upside down and then remain that way—doing so triggers their evolution into Malamar. Malamar are masters of manipulation; by waving their tentacles and flashing the lights on their mantles hypnotically, they can manipulate those who see them into doing their bidding. In the wild, Malamar hypnotize prey into drawing close before wrapping victims in their tentacles and excreting digestive fluids onto them. Their two primary fins are surprisingly sharp and can easily cut unprotected flesh. In civilized society, their powers pose far more sinister applications; there have been confirmed cases of Malamar controlling people serving as judges, police officers, and high-ranking officials in criminal groups—most notably Team Plasma. A number of conspiracists even hypothesize that Malamar control a number of world leaders as well, in the same vein as Aegislash were purported to in medieval times. Some even go as far as to claim that Malamar are behind every current celebrity in the world.","Binacle can be found on rocky beaches and in tide pools. They are always found in pairs attached to rocks. Though they appear sessile, Binacle can in fact move, albeit laboriously, by contracting and then extending their bodies to “leap” forwards. This motion requires two individuals to work together in unison, which is likely why Binacle live in pairs. Still, cooperation is imperative for both attacking and defending, and bickering Binacle are unlikely to survive for long. These creatures attach themselves to rocks by excreting a special cement that glues them to stones; even the strongest forces cannot pull them off once attached. When threatened, Binacle contract themselves and hide the vulnerable portions of their bodies, exposing only their bare heads and sharp claws. Binacle are capable of removing themselves from rocks by excreting an enzyme that dissolves the cement holding them, allowing them to inch away to find other stones; they are known to do this when bickering with their partners (though extracting themselves does leave them completely exposed until they can find new rocks). These Pokémon feed on seaweed and algae that washes onto the shore, making the most of each high tide.","Binacle gain an additional five individuals upon evolution into Barbaracle. All the heads of a Barbaracle are connected by a single nervous system, but each individual has its own independently-functioning brain. This enables each limb to think for itself, which is valuable in critical emergencies; however, in order to work most efficiently, the other six limbs will normally follow the orders of the head, which functions as the leader of the seven. Individual Barbaracle have been known to “secede” from their bodies (by dissolving the cement binding them to their rocks), however, if they disagree with the orders they are given. While the individuals serving as the arms and legs of a Barbaracle have rather obvious purposes, the two units on the shoulders possess less clear jobs. They are known as the “scout” individuals, who use their eyes to help Barbaracle scan the entire area around them (though all eyes of a Barbaracle are fully functional, the scouts are entirely dedicated to keeping watch). These two scout limbs, along with the other appendages as well as the heads, can be used to brutally assail opponents with barrages of sharp claws and the equivalent strength of seven individuals.","Skrelp are poor swimmers and travel very slowly through the water, as their pectoral fins cannot efficiently propel their upright bodies (their close relatives, Horsea, have modified dorsal fins on their backs to correct this). Skrelp do not need to be agile, however, because they spend their time camouflaging themselves in kelp forests, where they are virtually indistinguishable from the seaweed thanks to the growths on their bodies that resemble rotting kelp. In these forests, Skrelp patiently wait for unwary prey seeking shelter within the kelp to swim by before spraying them with liquid poison and consuming them; the bulk of their diets, however, is the very rotting kelp that they hide in. These Pokémon try to move as little as possible in order to conserve energy for evolution and avoid predation. In some regions, dried Skrelp is thought to have powerful medicinal properties. People of these areas consume Skrelp powder in minute quantities, as even half an ounce more than the standard dosage can be fatally poisonous. This practice, though outlawed worldwide, remains common in rural areas. In Alolan waters, Skrelp can be found clustered around wild Dhelmise.","Sailors across the world fear Dragalge. These Pokémon inhabit kelp forests and trenches, and will indiscriminately attack and destroy anything that enters their territories—ships included. Many nautical legends involve Dragalge sinking boats before the sailors onboard could even call for help, causing entire ships to mysteriously disappear. Their corrosive poison is capable of dissolving holes into the hulls of tankers, making quick work of even the sturdiest vessels. Old nautical maps often depict images of Dragalge over certain swathes of the ocean to warn sailors that they should avoid these areas. These Pokémon are tied with Jellicent in the number of shipwrecks they have caused. Luckily, Dragalge confine themselves to specific areas of the sea, particularly deep trenches and thick kelp forests, where they disguise themselves to ambush unwary prey. In areas where Dragalge do live, however, they tend to appear in large numbers; it is likely that any vessel that tries to sail through them will encounter at least one Dragalge. Dragalge are especially drawn to Dhelmise; while the connection both Pokémon have to seaweed is obvious enough, the exact nature of their relationship has yet to be fully explored.","Clauncher can be most commonly found crawling around in warm coral reefs, though they also inhabit cooler waters as well. These Pokémon are most famous for their specialized right claws, which are much larger than their left ones. These claws can fire compressed shots of water much like pistols by expelling pressurized internal gas from within these Pokémon’s bodies. At close range, a single shot from a Clauncher claw can pulverize stone. These shots can travel surprisingly far, though they lose speed and force exponentially as they travel. Clauncher use these claws to hunt prey and defend themselves from enemies, shooting bullets of water at foes from a distance. They also use them to jet themselves through the water in quick bursts. The lighting-quick mechanism Clauncher use to fire water, which is too fast to be seen by the human eye, also creates a cavitation bubble that collapses to make a booming sound that is loud enough to deafen or even paralyze those that are too close. This sound is currently one of the loudest naturally-produced noises known in the entire ocean. These claws can occasionally fall off, leaving Clauncher temporarily defenseless; their meat is notoriously delicious and is considered a delicacy in many regions. Humorously, they also make Clauncher terrible, unbalanced swimmers, which is likely why they prefer to scuttle or jet along the reef floor.","When Clauncher evolve into Clawitzer, their launching claws develop greatly while the rest of their bodies remain mostly unchanged. The right claws of these Pokémon, through the expulsion of highly pressurized gas, can launch large cannonballs of water at high speeds through great distances. Such shots are able to pierce directly through the hulls of tankers even when relatively far away. Additionally, these claws can expel water from specialized nozzles on their rears to propel Clawitzer forwards at 60 knots (70 mph, or 111 km/h). The collapse of the cavitation bubbles these creatures produce when firing water can let loose bright flashes of light incredibly loud booming sounds. Even if Clawitzer miss their prey when hunting (which they often do because of the unwieldy nature of their huge claws), the deafening noise and blinding light they produce often stuns victims long enough to allow them to try again with second shots. The antennae on a Clawitzer’s launching claw can sense changes in water currents to help it detect prey. As with Clauncher, their primary claws fall off occasionally and are prized as a luxury ingredient in high-end restaurants.","Helioptile make their homes in hot, flat deserts where there are few trees to block out the sunlight. These Pokémon are adapted to the sweltering, dry conditions of deserts and can survive for long periods of time without drinking water. The flaps on either side of their heads help dissipate excess heat; they can also unfold into flat frills, which, thanks to their black coloration, can absorb sunlight very efficiently. Helioptile convert the sunlight absorbed by their frills into electrical energy, which they can use to sustain themselves in lieu of food. They can also use this energy to defend themselves from predators by stunning them with electric shocks. Interrupting sunbathing Helioptile stresses them out greatly, leave them weak and defenseless against predators. The triangular tips of their frills light up when launching electrical attacks. On cloudy days, Helioptile will hide themselves and lie dormant in order to conserve as much energy as possible until the sun comes out again. Today, modern solar panel technology is based largely upon extended scientific research on the abilities of Helioptile and their evolutions, Heliolisk, to take advantage of the photoelectric effect.","The small orange frills surrounding a Heliolisk’s neck are in fact part of a much larger black collar which can unfold into a light-absorbing disk around the Pokémon’s head. The greater area of a Heliolisk’s frills allow it to create electricity through the photoelectric effect much more efficiently than Helioptile; when fully charged, a single Heliolisk can provide enough electricity to power the lights of an entire skyscraper. Heliolisk also use electricity to stimulate their own muscles. They can cover 100 yards (91 meters) in merely five seconds and even run across the surface of water for a brief period of time using the extra strength provided by jolts of electricity. However, they must recharge after such energy-demanding tasks. Heliolisk spend much of their time standing still with their frills unfolded in the sun to gather energy. When they attack, the tips of their frills will glow brightly. During mating season, these diurnal Pokémon will unfold and light up their frills to attract mates. Individuals with the largest frills are deemed the most attractive. An ancient desert culture once praised Heliolisk, believing them to be mystical and connected to a deity they worshipped. When this culture's ruins were excavated by Galarian archaeologists, a number of Heliolisk snuck onboard with the unearthed artifacts and made it to Galar, establishing the population that exists there today.","Tyrunt are prehistoric Pokémon that roamed around jungles about 100 million years alongside many other ancient Pokémon, like Lileep, Anorith, Shieldon, Cranidos, and Tirtouga. Today, they can be resurrected from excavated Jaw Fossils. Tyrunt have extremely powerful jawbones that can crunch with enough pressure to flatten automobile parts. These strong bones make their heads very heavy, so it is very difficult for Tyrunt to stand upright; consequently, they often hold their heads very close to the ground. Tyrunt are extremely finicky Pokémon; they will throw wild tantrums when they are displeased by something. Trainers of Tyrunt often report that their Pokémon will enter property-destroying fits of anger after slights as minor as being served a food that they dislike. Commonly characterized as spoiled, they do not play well with others and often hurt smaller Pokémon when roughhousing. Tyrunt also despise doing practically anything on their own; in the wild, Tyrunt were cared for entirely by their parents, who would bring them food, bathe them, and even lull them to sleep. Consequently, orphaned Tyrunt rarely survived for long without their parents. Some scientists believed that Tyrunt looked quite different in the past compared to how they look when resurrected from Jaw Fossils; a few even postulate that these Pokémon were entirely feathered instead of simply collared with feathers.","Tyrantrum were undoubtedly the apex predators of the jungles 100 million years ago. Their incredibly strong jaws can crush through solid metal like paper, and their vicious brutality made them a feared force amongst other prehistoric Pokémon. As the top of the food chain, Tyrantrum had little to worry about other than finding food and were believed to essentially rule ancient jungles like kings—they ate anything and travelled anywhere thy wanted to. Tyrantrum, however, often ended up being controlled a certain other species of Pokémon—their own offspring Tyrunt. Greatly protective of their young, Tyrantrum would go to great lengths in order to please their incredibly picky children. Scientists are baffled as to how these dominating predators could have gone extinct; most hypothesize some sort of external event outside of their control, such as an massive asteroid impact or a freezing ice age, as a possible reason for their extinction. The scientific world has not yet reached a consensus on a single convincing explanation, however. Some scientists believed that the Tyrantrum of ancient times were fully covered in feathers, and the feather collar that modern revived Tyrantrum possess is merely what can be salvaged by modern technology.","Alive approximately 100 million years ago, Amaura can be revived from ancient Sail Fossils, though they have also been successfully resurrected from frozen tissue preserved in glaciers. Amaura were unique amongst most prehistoric Pokémon in that they lived in freezing, icy tundras rather than warm jungles or seas. In these areas, they did not face predation from carnivores like Tyrantrum. The crystals on either side of their bodies emanate freezing cold air that allow them to freeze water in the atmosphere to use Ice-type attacks. They can create effects similar to that of magnetic auroras by suspending tiny ice crystals in the air, though it should be noted that the two phenomena are unrelated. Still, some believe that an aurora appears in the sky whenever an Amaura whinnies. Scientists once believed that Amaura were able to survive low temperatures by being warm-blooded, but recent research has revealed that their blood contains antifreeze proteins. Though Amaura were able to survive the ice age that wiped out most of their contemporaries, they likely went extinct in the following warming period; for this reason, they can be difficult to raise in modern conditions except in the iciest environments, as the modern world is much warmer than that of the ice age.","Aurorus are large, slow Pokémon that once inhabited frozen tundras. Because of their harsh environments, they did not have to fear most predators, who could not survive the cold; Aurorus have antifreeze proteins in their blood that enable them to endure freezing temperatures. The crystals on these Pokémon chill the surrounding air to temperatures as low as -240°F (-150°C), allowing them to instantly freezing moisture in the air. Aurorus use this ability to form blocks of ice in front of them and block incoming attacks; when threatened, they may also try to encase their foes in ice. These Pokémon can also create aurora-like lights by diffracting light through tiny ice crystals in the air. Because Aurorus relied primarily on the bitter cold to keep predators away from them, they likely went extinct during an ancient warming period in which much of the world’s ice melted. Such an event allowed many predators, who saw the large, yet slow and relatively defensive Aurorus as easy prey, to venture further north into once-icy regions. Scientists have recently discovered a fully-intact Aurorus frozen in a northern glacier; it is believed that the Aurorus froze itself to protect itself from some sort of danger, though the nature of this threat is unknown.","Trainers that play with their Eevee often may one day see them evolve into Sylveon. These Pokémon are almost always found alongside humans, though there have been some reports of particularly playful wild Eevee evolving into Sylveon as well. Sylveon dislike conflicts and will attempt to avoid them whenever possible. In fact, the sight of their ribbonlike feelers waving in the air seems to placate many fighters. These feelers are able to sense the emotions of the living things that they touch. When not in battle, Sylveon have a habit of wrapping their feelers around their trainers’ arms as if holding hands. By doing so, they can sense every emotion that their trainers feel. Sylveon can use the powerful Fairy-type move Moonblast in battle. Elusive wild Sylveon dwell in lush woodlands, where they are surrounded by life and can easily avoid hostility. Despite having no prior contact with people, these wild individuals seem to prefer the company of humans to other beings. In battle, they may use their feelers to placate foes before attacking. They seem to be able to sense when they have the upper hand in battle, and will charge headfirst into situations that they feel they can win easily. A popular Galarian fairytale tells the story of a fearless Sylveon battling and vanquishing a mighty Hydreigon.","Hawlucha are agile fighters that have the ability to take to the skies. Though small and relatively frail, the dexterity of these Pokémon allow them to stay on par with the likes of heavier Pokémon such as Machamp and Hariyama in battle. Hawlucha cannot truly fly; rather, they jump into the air or leap from high places and use their wings to soar on wind currents. They can deftly switch between different drafts to stay in the air for long periods of time. Hawlucha prefer to attack foes from above, diving below to strike when opponents show an opening in a technique known as Flying Press. Their style of fighting is thought to be very elegant, with an emphasis on well-executed submission holds. In fact, Hawlucha take great pride in the grace of their attacks and will often perform twirls and spins in the air simply for show. They will always strike a pose before delivering finishing blows. Sometimes, they will accidentally spend so much time on performing that they end up giving opponents an opening, much to their embarrassment. Because of the artistic style of their fighting, many people enjoy watching Hawlucha battle; many television shows dedicated to watching Hawlucha (or people imitating them) duel each other and show off their techniques have proved to be very successful. ​","Dedenne are naturally found in meadows and fields, but are far more commonly seen in cities. These Pokémon drain electricity from wall sockets by sticking their tails into them; they sometimes become household pests, as a small family of Dedenne living in and draining the electricity of a home can quickly cause electricity bills to skyrocket. They also can be problems near power plants for this reason. Dedenne can fire bolts of electricity from their lower antennae-shaped whiskers; their upper ones simply detect changes in air and electric currents around them. These whiskers are also capable of sending radio waves, allowing Dedenne to communicate with each other over vast distances. Radios sometimes experience interference when these Pokémon are in the area; to combat this, towers may send out “dummy” radio waves to interfere with Dedenne communication and ward them away. Despite the numerous problems Dedenne can cause, however, they make for popular pets because of their cuteness and relative ease of care, as they can subsist entirely on electricity from wall sockets.","Carbink live deep beneath the surface; sometimes, they can even be found lying dormant in solid rock, having been encased through the earth’s slow geological processes. These creatures are believed to be hundreds of millions of years old, or possibly even as ancient as the earth itself. They are rarely seen in the open because of their seclusion and are rumored to have been born out of the immense heat and pressure of the underground (though they are not very rare in caves). Intense pressure has made them incredibly hard; some of the carbon within their bodies has even been compressed into diamond as a result. They can fire beams of energy from their gems. Carbink are most commonly seen above-ground when accidentally uncovered during construction projects or cave excavations, having been lying dormant. They are popular Pokémon for their beautiful gemstones, which are usually spotless; groups of them will rub their soft manes on one another to polish each other's gems. Carbink have a mysterious relationship with the mythical Pokémon Diancie (said to be a mutated Carbink itself), and are said to serve under its rule.","Though they don’t look the part, Goomy are in fact Dragon-type Pokémon. These Pokémon have no bones, chitin, or other hard tissues within their mostly-aquatic bodies whatsoever, allowing them to contort themselves and squeeze through tight spaces. Goomy are often considered the weakest of all Dragon-type Pokémon because of their paltry attacks and soft torsos. However, they are far from defenseless; their gooey bodies are covered in slick films of special mucus that cause physical attacks to slide off of them harmlessly. It also possesses a moderate paralyzing agent that will stun those that try to grab them. This mucus also helps keep these Pokémon hydrated outside of wet environments, though they can only keep the Pokémon protected temporarily; Goomy must spend most of their time resting in damp, shady areas in order to keep their slimy bodies from drying out, as they breathe through their skin. Despite these protections, Goomy are still timid creatures that will hide as soon as their horns sense danger. These horns are very sensitive to changes in air flow and humidity, allowing them to detect the precense of others from afar. Because of their cute appearances, Goomy are popular amongst trainers of all ages. They serve as the mascots of companies, universities, fan clubs. The protection of Goomy habitats was the main motivation behind the declaration of Kalos Route 14 as a nature preserve.","For some odd reason scientists have not yet figured out, Goomy essentially lose their sight upon evolution. Sliggoo have severely underdeveloped eyes compared to both Goomy and Goodra; one hypothesis explaining this is similar to that of cave troglodytes, in which Goomy lose their vision upon evolution because it is largely unnecessary for survival in the damp and dark swamps where they live. Instead of sight, Sliggoo use their four horns to detect both sound and smell; these senses are highly  developed to compensate for their lack of vision. To protect themselves, Sliggoo will excrete a sticky yet highly corrosive liquid onto foes (consisting of digestive fluids mixed with mucoid glycoproteins). They slurp of the dissolved remains of prey, as they are toothless. They seem to have trouble distinguishing friend from food, however. Their humps resemble shells, but in fact hold their coiled digestive tracts as well as their small brains. It is said that they are only able to think of finding food and escaping enemies as they strive towards evolution.As Sliggoo travel, they leave behind trails of foul-tasting, gooey mucus that most predators avoid; it is likely that the disgusting slime keeps them at bay.","When Sliggoo evolve into Goodra, they regain their sight, once again for some reason that scientists don’t yet understand. Despite evolving from the weak Goomy, Goodra are among the strongest Dragon-types in existence. They are normally found in wet swamps and marshes, as they need to stay moist at all times. However, the slimy mucus covering their bodies, which drips off of them as they travel, can keep them hydrated for long periods of time. Goodra are friendly, though shy and a bit slow-witted. They display their affection by hugging their friends or trainers. This leaves their loved ones covered in a sticky, unfortunately cloth-staining, slime. They will cry gooey tears when lonely. Despite their amiability, however, Goodra can attack powerfully in battle. They use their stretchy horns to launch devastating punches with strength a hundred times greater than that of a pro boxer. They can also coat their foes in sticky mucus to slow down their movement and whip them with their strong tails. The combination of slime and a thick layer of fat beneath their skin allows Goodra to shake off direct hits easily. Goodra love playing in the rain and will leave their shady habitats to frolic about during drizzles.","Klefki are a rather odd species of Pokémon; from the scant information known about their past, they seem to have sprung into existence around the same time that humans settled into civilizations rather than hunter-gatherer nomadic tribes. Some scientists believe that they used to live primarily in mines before humans developed metalworking. These Pokémon spend their lives simply collecting keys; no one knows what purpose this serves them as a species. Regardless, Klefki will float around human settlements in search of keys. When they find ones they like, they will unhook their loops and add them to their collections before resealing their loops again. They will protect their keys with their lives, only releasing them to trusted allies and trainers. For this reason, some businesses train Klefki to protect valuable keys to safes and vaults. These Pokémon jingle their keys as a warning signal to foes, though this technique seems to be rather ineffective at warding off aggressors. They can wield a number of status-inflicting enchantments rather well, however. Generally, when keys suddenly go missing, they were likely stolen by Klefki; they seem to very much prefer master copies, settling for lesser versions only if they are the only ones around.","According to folklore, Phantump are the souls of children who died while lost in the forest. They are said to be created when these souls possess rotting stumps. Phantump sound strikingly similar to scared children crying out in distress. Each one has a unique cry; many believe that these shrieks are the voices of the children that Phantump used to be. These Pokémon are said to use their cries to lure people and Pokémon looking to help lost children into the woods. There, they face the same fate that Phantump were said to have succumbed to, being trapped forever in the forest as Trevenant shift trees to block their escape. Parents always warn their children about Phantump and Trevenant to keep them from venturing unsupervised into the woods. Some believe that the Phantump are unaware of the fates of their victims, as they are only calling out to find friends to play with. Phantump themselves seem to always be very hesitant to leave the abandoned woods in which they dwell; they can be lured out, however, with stuffed animals, candy, and other things that young children enjoy. It is said boiling their leaves will create an all-curing remedy, though some warn that this is a form of black magic.","Many legends include malicious Trevenant, which most modern interpretations consider a manifestation of the natural fear of what lurks within gloomy forests. Trevenant can be found in dark, eerie woods, where they form a vital part of local ecosystems. In addition to providing shelter for a number of different Pokémon, they are also capable of manipulating trees by extending their nerve-containing roots underground to attach to other roots like makeshift “nervous” systems of sorts. This ability allows Trevenant to protect their forests from attackers, shifting trees to block entrances and exits. If someone attempts to harm their forests, Trevenant will punish them by cursing and trapping them in the woods for all of eternity, unable to escape the moving trees. It is said that people trapped in this manner eventually turn into Phantump or Trevenant themselves (or are devoured, according to some myths). Trevenant dislike light and despise fire, however, so lumberjacks will bring along Fire-type Pokémon as a safety precaution. Despite their ominous reputations, Trevenant are very kind to the Pokémon that dwell on their bodies and in their forests and will not bother those who do not try to endanger them.","Pumpkaboo are crepuscular (specifically, vespertine) Pokémon that also remain active throughout the night. They are most restless, however, just as the sun sets and twilight arrives. These Pokémon are said to be souls unable to cross into the spirit world, taking refuge inside pumpkins instead until they can finally pass. Their gourd bodies can vary considerably in size and weight. Though unable to enter the spirit world themselves, Pumpkaboo are thought to act as psychopomps, leading recently-deceased souls to places where they can move on. The Pokémon Dusknoir are believed to pick these spirits up here to ferry them into the world of the dead while Pumpkaboo remain behind. The lights on these Pokémon’s bodies are thought to show lost spirits the path to the spirit world; for this reason, living travelers who encounter these lights try to avoid them whenever possible. Some believe that Pumpkaboo can hypnotize those that stare into these lights for too long. When daylight approaches, Pumpkaboo settle down, rest, and wait for the sun to set again. They sleep, like pumpkins, on the dirt in fields and rural areas.","Like Pumpkaboo, Gourgeist come in a range of different sizes and weights; larger Gourgeist tend to be more durable, but slower, while smaller ones are more agile, but frailer. Gourgeist were feared in the past by villagers and townspeople who lived near their habitats. On nights of the new moon, these Pokémon would wander throughout city streets singing an eerie, blood-chilling song that was thought to curse those who heard it. Villagers were not to open doors to anyone; it was believed that Gourgeist would go knocking from house to house and would spirit away anyone who answered. As a ritual to keep them at bay, townspeople would light candles inside gourds resembling Gourgeist and place them in front of their houses in hopes that the lights would make their streets too bright for them to travel (as they are only active during the new moon). This tradition still carries on today in some areas, though people now know that the singing of these Pokémon doesn’t actually curse listeners. Costumed children will go from house to house knocking like Gourgiest were said to do. To hunt, Gourgeist wrap their hairlike arms around their victims and drain their souls. They sing their signature, unsettling melody, seemingly gleefully, while watching their prey suffer.","Bergmite live in large herds on top of freezing glaciers and within the crags of icy mountains. They spend much of their time living on top of parent Avalugg, huddling upon their flat backs. They will freeze their feet into place to keep from sliding about. Bergmite greatly dislike temperatures above freezing and never venture anywhere not covered in snow or ice; unlike their evolutions Avalugg, their bodies cannot withstand heat for extended periods of time. This is why they often cluster on top of their parents, as the bodies of Avalugg radiate freezing air that keep their children comfortable. To defend themselves, Bergmite expel chilling air of temperatures as low as -150ºF (-100ºC) to freeze foes solid. They cover their bodies with sharp spikes of ice by freezing moisture in the air to shield themselves from attacks. Bergmite never allow their true bodies to show through the ice covering them. They chill the air around them in order to fix cracks in this ice. When faced with particularly strong threats, Bergmite will wedge themselves into the crevasses of their parent Avalugg, only exposing their icy spikes to potential danger.","Avalugg are often seen with herds of Bergmite, their offspring, huddled on their backs. This makes them appear like aircraft carriers from a distance. The true bodies of Avalugg are coated in thick layers of ice; this ice is as hard as steel and resistant to melting. They radiate chilling air from their bodies, encouraging Bergmite to stay on their freezing backs rather than venture out into their warmer surroundings. Their heavy, hard bodies can crush most objects with ease. However, they are also rather cumbersome and slow, and experiencing great difficulty when attempting to pass through narrow areas. Despite their weight, Avalugg have bodies that are less dense than water, enabling them to float like rafts when submerged. They will carry their offspring from glacier to glacier in this manner. When Avalugg are threatened, the Bergmite on their backs will lodge themselves into their crevasses, covering them in sharp and icy spikes. With their backsides protected, Avalugg will then try to crush foes with their weight. Avalugg are diurnal Pokémon; their crevasses can be observed widening in the morning sun as they go about their day before rebuilding as they rest for the night.","Noibat can be found in dark caves where little to no light penetrates. Because vision is largely useless in these areas, Noibat have adapted to navigate their surroundings through echolocation. They can produce ultrasonic pitches as high as 200,000 Hertz, far higher than human ears can perceive.  Unlike other Pokémon that use echolocation, however, Noibat don’t create these sound waves from their mouths; instead, the organs that both produce and receive sonic waves are located in their large ears. The pitches that Noibat use for echolocation can be disorienting even to people and Pokémon that do not consciously hear them; pro-wrestlers trained to maintain their balance can become dizzy when near these Pokémon. People traveling in Noibat caves often become lost because of the disorienting sounds. Noibat use this ability when threatened to confuse foes and escape. Prolonged exposure to the frequencies at which Noibat echolocate can damage a person’s hearing. Noibat trainers are advised to wear special headphones that block out such frequencies. Recently, it has been discovered that these Pokémon use sonar to determine the hollowness and thus ripeness of fruits, their favorite food.","Noivern spend the day sleeping in dark caves. At night, particularly on those of new moons, they venture out into forests in search of prey. Noivern use their echolocation to locate and ambush unsuspecting victims. They emit ultrasonic sound waves from their ears to disorient prey before they swoop in. These Pokémon are omnivores, however, and enjoy eating many different kinds of fruits and berries—they seem to have a particular affinity for Persim Berries. They can create sonic waves powerful enough to shatter boulders. Noivern tend to be aggressive Pokémon that will indiscriminately attack those who enter their territories. They are even known to be cruel, tormenting small Pokémon lost in the dark for pleasure. A peace offering of fruit, however, will often be enough to calm hostile Noivern down. In battle, Noivern can utilize many sound-based attacks to bring down foes, such as the dizzying Supersonic and the powerful Boomburst. They communicate warnings to other Noivern about territorial boundaries using sonar; those unfortunate enough to be caught between two conflicting Noivern may sometimes faint from dizziness.","Xerneas holds the power of life in its control. According to legend, it has the ability to grant immortality to those who find it; many Kalos legends involve people on quests attempting (and failing) to locate this mythical Pokémon. It is thought to be able to sprout thriving forests and revive the dead with its powers. Xerneas has the ability to transform into a giant tree and lie dormant for a thousand years, releasing its life energy throughout the world in the process; its reawakening is said to represent rebirth. Even when awake, Xerneas usually remains in its blue Neutral Mode. When using its abilities, however, its seven-colored horns and striped body will glow radiantly. Though Xerneas is the Pokémon of life, it should be noted that in Kalos mythology, life is not strictly “good;” rather, it is only half of one of the world’s integral processes. The tragic story of the immortal AZ, doomed to wander the earth forever, is often cited as an example of the consequences of eternal life. In the same way, people should desire that Xerneas and Yveltal remain in balance.","Yveltal controls the powers of death and destruction. When its black markings glow red, it absorbs the life force of all of the living things around it. For this reason, it is believed to inhabit desolate wastelands—areas that were once lush with life until it arrived. This Pokémon is said to only awaken every thousand years, lying dormant in a cocoon for centuries. According to legends, Yveltal’s awakening brings barrenness to fields, desiccation to rivers, and famine to villages. Right before it transforms into a cocoon to slumber, it will absorb the life energy of everything around it, as well as some of the whole world’s, one fintal time.  While Yveltal ushers in death and destruction, however, the culture of the Kalos region does not treat it as monstrosity. According to Kalos mythology, life and death are a necessary cycle of the world that must remain in balance; when Xerneas creates vibrant, thriving life, Yveltal must also take life away to keep the world in order. Though many people of Kalos do not desire death, they do not wish to remain alive for all of eternity, either.","Zygarde is believed to dwell underground in a hidden cave, keeping a very close watch on events going on in the world above. Very little is known about this mysterious legendary; according to traditional Kalos mythology, Zygarde will only reveal itself when the region’s ecosystem is in massive disarray, an event that has only happens in two cases. The first is when Xerneas awakens without Yveltal and causes the world to be overpopulated with life; the other is when Yveltal awakens without Xerneas and destroys much of the world. In either case, Zygarde will use its powers to force the offending Pokémon back into its slumber to restore order. Some people warn of a third situation that would awaken Zygarde—human activity disturbing the natural balance. Zygarde is made up of many Cells controlled by Cores; these Cores each have minds of their own and will gather Cells to help them deal with crises. 10% of the Cells combine to form its speedy, close combat-oriented 10% Forme; half of them combine for its serpentine 50% Forme, said to act as a sentinel watching over the environment; all of them combine for its powerful Complete Forme, said to possess the power to neutralize any threat to the world's balance.","Diancie is a mythical Pokémon said to be a mutated Carbink. It is believed to rule over an entire underground kingdom of jewels called the Diamond Domain, served by loyal Carbink. Diancie can instantly create diamonds by compressing carbon in the air between its hands; it can then fire these sharp gemstones at foes in an attack known as Diamond Storm. Diancie’s diamonds are said to have impeccable clarity and color and are thought to be the most beautiful jewels in the world. For this reason, the Diamond Domain has long been a fabled location for treasure hunters to pursue in hopes of great wealth. These diamonds are also believed to prevent illness and misfortune for those who hold or wear them. Diancie oversees the legendary Diamond Domain and makes sure that it always remains hidden from those who intended to loot it or steal from it. It also is in charge of creating the Heart Diamond, a mystical gemstone that, according to legend, is the sole source of energy that allows the Diamond Domain to continue to exist.","The mythical Hoopa is said to be a troublemaking trickster that can open portals to other dimensions with its hoop. It is thought to use this ability to cause interdimensional mischief, though some believe that it also uses it to hoard objects that catch its interest in some unknown realm. Long ago, an ancient desert civilization was said to have sealed Hoopa’s true power away in an artifact known as the Prison Bottle. Opening the bottle would restore its strength for a short time; in this form, known as Unbound Hoopa, it becomes a monstrous, six-handed beast that would be able to transport anything between dimensions. Legends say that this gigantic creature once carried an entire castle of gold along with it through a hyperspace hole because of its greed. Luckily, this transformation is only temporary; after some time, the Prison Bottle will reabsorb its power and Hoopa will once again become Confined. It is thought that Confined Hoopa passes its time by playing tricks on unwary beings across dimensions.","Volcanion is rumored to reside deep in the mountains that border southern Kalos. According to mythology, it in fact created this part of the region by blowing away parts of the mountain range and creating a more accessible plain. The people of the area worship it for this reason. However, this Pokémon is also said to dislike humans, cloaking its domain in thick fog to deter travelers from approaching. The large ring on its body can actually detach and rotate to form two large cannons. Volcanion can fire superheated steam from these cannons with incredible force. It is thought to gather water from mountain lakes and streams for this purpose, storing it within its large hump; it then quickly heats it to rapidly produce steam. The dots on its cannons are thought to be indicative of how much water Volcanion has left, dimming and then turning red once it has completely run out. Some people believe that this Pokémon may dislike humans because it was alive to witness the horrible destruction that the great war of Kalos left behind 3,000 years ago.","Rowlet are one of the starter Pokémon that trainers of Alola can choose when they begin their journeys. These perceptive Pokémon can turn their heads 180º to scan all around themselves. Their keen eyes also grant them with superb night vision, which these nocturnal hunters take great advantage of. Rowlet spend the day resting in the treetops, gathering energy from sunlight through photosynthesis as they sleep. When night falls, they take flight. Rowlet stalk prey from above without making a single sound, carefully positioning themselves before diving down and ambushing their prey with a pummeling of fast kicks with their sharp talons. They can also use the move Leafage to fire their sharp, feather-like leaves from their wings like arrows and impale victims. Rowlet have an odd habit of turning their heads around fully to watch their trainers intently during battles. They are calmed by dark, tight spaces and will often burrow into the bags and coat pockets of trainers to rest. They are popular amongst Alolan trainers for their stoic demeanors and observational skills, making them common choices for starter Pokémon.","Many beginning trainers are surprised when their Rowlet, once quiet and unassuming, evolve into vain and proper Dartrix. Dartrix are obsessed with their appearances, spending most of their free time preening themselves. If their feathers become dirty or unkempt, they will be rendered unable to focus on anything else until they tidy themselves up. Consequently, they will also get angry at and stop listening to trainers that ignore their need for cleanliness. They can also be quite high-strung Pokémon; if they make an error in battle, they will obsess over it and often exacerbate the mistake by desperately trying to fix it. All of this fussiness, however, belies the fact that Dartrix are very skilled archers. When focused, Dartrix can sense approaching foes from any direction, even behind. They can fire sharp feathers, known as blade quills at opponents and strike them dead-on without even looking. Dartrix can even curve the trajectories of their quills to arc around obstacles and reach their targets. Dartrix trainers must learn to manage their Pokémon’s fussiness in order to take advantage of their true skill.","Decidueye are incredibly skilled at both stealth and archery. When a Decidueye decides upon a target, it will seemingly disappear from view as it begins to stalk it from afar. Once its victim completely loses track of it, it will strike with a single arrow quill, plucking it from within its wing and stringing it on its vine-like tassels. Decidueye can fire feathers within a tenth of a second and over half a mile (0.8 km) away. It is said that they shoot with enough strength to pierce a pebble over 100 yards (90 meters) away. Decidueye can nock and shoot within a tenth of a second, and can expertly curve their arrow quills to strike unsuspecting foes. Decidueye can fire barrages of arrows into the air so that they rain down on many foes beneath them. Though they no longer are as fussy as Dartrix and usually remain calm and collected, they can sometimes become very flustered when taken by surprise. They sometimes pull on the vine on their head as a security blanket of sorts to improve their focus. Despite these occasional outbursts, many trainers still admire Decidueye for their spectacular precision and stealth, making them one of the most popular starters in Alola.","Starting trainers in the Alola region have the opportunity to choose Litten as their starter Pokémon. Litten are known for their level-headedness and lack of outward displays of emotion. They secrete flammable oils from their skin that coats their fur. When they lick and groom themselves, they store some of this fur within their stomachs, forming furballs. Litten can cough up and ignite these furballs to shoot fireballs at foes; the size of these attacks depends on the amount of fur collected, while the way they are launched depends on how they are coughed up. Instead of shedding their fur gradually like most felines, Twice a year, Litten will ignite all of their fur at once in a fierce but quick blaze. Though many trainers choose Litten for their collected natures, they also often find that it can be difficult to gain their trust and affection because of how distant and solitary they are. Many find that Litten respond best to a moderate amount of attention; they remain aloof with too little care, but are put off if smothered. Once their faith is gained, however, Litten become reliable and loyal partners that any Alolan trainer would be lucky to have by their side.","Litten undergo a somewhat drastic change in personality when they evolve. Instead of being distant, Torracat in fact act somewhat bratty around familiar faces. Some would even call them spoiled; they may even scratch their trainers if they displease them. Torracat also have gained a burning desire for combat. In battle, they will not stop fighting until their opponents lose their will to continue battling. Torracat use their thick manes, which have actually adapted to take the place of standard whiskers, to navigate dark areas. This helps them locate prey in the dim undergrowth of their jungle habitats or under the cover of dark nights. Torracat also possess external flame sacs that adorn their necks. When they utilize Fire-type attacks, these sacs flare up and quickly begin to heat, allowing them to begin spewing flames within seconds. The sound of fire being expelled from these sacs is said to be akin to that of a brass bell. These organs also heat up and cool down depending on their owners’ emotions. When Torracat enter the fervor of battle, their passion keeps their flame sacs burning at maximum brightness. Their fur will stand on end when Torracat healthy and happy, but lie flat and matted when they are sick or upset.","Trainers that can gain the affection of distant Litten and deal with impetuous Torracat are rewarded with powerful Incineroar. When Torracat evolve, their flame sacs become “flame belts,” named so because of their resemblance to wrestling championship belts. These belts ignite as these Pokémon engage in intense battles, reaching up to 3,600°F (6,500°C). Incineroar live for the heat of battle; they can become so engrossed in fights that they may ignore their trainers’ orders in favor of their own. They may even hurt opposing trainers in their fervors. Perhaps even moreso than than fighting, though, Incineroar love the adoration of others. They fight most fiercely when watched by a crowd, using grand kicks and punches before finishing off foes with showy, fiery spirals from their belts. Though they try to seem aloof on the outside, the love of young children and Pokémon gratifies them greatly. They get very depressed when heckled, however. Incineroar also lose the will to fight when faced with weaker foes; they much prefer the challenge of facing opponents as strong as or even stronger than themselves. Though they can be difficult to control, trainers of Incineroar can attest that these Pokémon truly have hearts of gold.","Alolan trainers have the option of choosing Popplio as their starter Pokémon when beginning their journeys. Popplio are semiaquatic creatures; though they can reach speeds of 25 mph (40 km/h) when swimming and are indeed more agile in the water than on land, they have a rather unique technique that helps them maneuver in terrestrial environments. Popplio can snort elastic bubbles (made of water thickened with glycoproteins) out of their nostrils that linger for long periods of time. They can then leap atop of and around these bubbles to travel much faster than by waddling. Creating such bubbles takes a lot of practice, and Popplio are famous for their diligence in training their bubble-inflating skills. As they train, they can blow larger and more resilient bubbles. These Pokémon are also playful when not practicing; they love to perform acrobatic tricks with their bubbles in front of others, which also serve as trial runs for new strategies in battle. After gaining height by bouncing on these bubbles, they can attack opponents from the air in highly technical maneuvers. They can also pop their bubbles to damage foes with surprising force. Because of their dedication, playfulness, and acrobatic capabilities in battle, Popplio make an excellent choice of starter Pokémon for any Alolan trainer.","Brionne live in colonies on beaches and rocks near the sea shore. They are skilled dancers that rehearse tirelessly in order to memorize new routines. Brionne teach one another dances through performance and imitation; they may also decide to learn routines from humans if they like them enough. Thanks to their practice, Brionne have impeccable timing and can keep in perfect sync with others even in routines that they have just learned. Though rehearsal can be tiring, these Pokémon never fail to get excited when they witness a new dance that they have yet to perfect. Colonies of Brionne can be observed dancing in unison under the light of the moon on nights of calm seas, often lead by a singing Primarina. In battle, Brionne combine their dancing with many large balloons of water to create stunning displays. As they prance about to confuse opponents, they slap balloons into them that explode upon contact. Brionne always strive to keep a positive and cheerful demeanor, even when they are upset, sad, or simply fatigued from their tireless rehearsals. They will only reveal their true emotions to those that they most closely trust; even wild Brionne in colonies may not outwardly display how they are feeling to other members.","Trainers who raise Popplio watch their tireless practice and dedication finally pay off when they evolve into Primarina. Primarina are exquisite vocalists and dancers whose vocal talents rival the best opera singers in the world. Many pay to see particularly accomplished Primarina perform in grand concert halls. In battle, Primarina use the vibrations created by their voices to maneuver sparkling bubbles around the field. Only some of these bubbles are explosive; they can leap around on the non-volatile ones to further play with opponents. The sight of a field of Primarina bubbles glittering in the moonlight is said to be breathtaking. Primarina teach one another new songs in their colonies, passing them down over the generations. They lead beautiful seaside concerts on moonlit nights. Consequently, each colony has its own unique repertoire. Trainers must be sure to take great care of their Primarina’s voices, as they cannot battle without them. Dry weather, consecutive battles, and throat damage all imperil their vocal abilities. Those that do manage this task, however, are able to battle alongside some of the most renowned performers in the world.","People that live near the rainforests that these Pokémon call home are very familiar with them and their evolutions. Pikipek use their beaks to bore holes in the sides of trees and store seeds. They can strike 16 times in a single second with enough force to shatter stone. Despite their small stature, Pikipek in fact have incredibly strong neck muscles that enable them to peck with such strength. Their drilling is very noisy; they use different rhythms of pecking in order to communicate with one another. Since their signals are loud and distinct from one another, people that live near them often learn to recognize what different rhythms mean. In fact, Pikipek communication is one of the most well-studied in the field. Pikipek also have a fondness of shiny objects, storing them in tree holes. This is the root of the Alolan saying, “Something lost, something missed, check inside the Pikipek nest.” Pikipek can also shoot seeds with great force from their beaks. They will pull seeds from their tree holes to fire at attackers from a distance when threatened; missed seeds often end up lodged in the bark of other trees. Since the seeds are frequently destroyed by this, however, Pikipek cannot store them effectively this way.","If Pikipek can be a bit of a nuisance for tropical inhabitants because of their incessant pecking, then Trumbeak can be absolute headaches. They are infamous for their loud, bugle-like calls as well as their lack of regard for quietude. The tips of their beaks are flexible and can bend backwards like “lips.” This allows them to buzz air through them in order to create their signature trumpeting. Though Trumbeak do not live together in the wild, they are not territorial towards others of their kind. In fact, they communicate with one another through their raucous calling; scientists believe that their cries are as loud and distinct as they are so they can clearly hear one another even across long distances. Over a hundred distinct Trumbeak cries have been recorded. When Trumbeak eat Berries, they store the seeds (which they cannot digest) within their long beaks. They can then fire all of the seeds at once in bursts to pummel enemies. This also makes them effective at dispersing the seeds of wild plants, spreading them far from their producers. Plants in Trumbeak habitats often have hard-shelled seeds that can withstand firing, and Trumbeak prefer these seeds because they are more effective at deterring attackers. In the late spring, male Trumbeak will begin to call even more loudly and cacophonously as they try to attract mates, much to the chagrin of people and other Pokémon alike.","Loud, cacophonous Trumbeak surprisingly evolve into quiet, crotchety Toucannon. Toucannon prefer to remain alone and undisturbed. They will only leave their nests to gather seeds or to find mates. Toucannon actually create and store volatile gases within their beaks. When endangered, they can heat their beaks to over 212ºF (100ºC) in order to ignite this gas and fire seed blasts with great force. As their beaks heat up, their segmented bands all gradually begin to turn red; when fully heated, they can cause severe burns upon contact and launch seeds with enough power to shatter stone. Toucannon can also heat their beaks to a lesser degree in order to keep their eggs warm. The only company that Toucannon enjoy is that of their offspring and their mates; their children will often bring back fruits and Berries to their parents’ nests, the seeds of which Toucannon can then use to power their attacks. Though infamous for being ornery, these Pokémon are seen as sweethearts when it comes to romance, as they mate for life. In Alola, pairs of Toucannon often are brought to weddings as a sign of good luck. Humorously enough, the raucous trumpeting of younger Trumbeak seems to irritate Toucannon just as much as it does other Pokémon and people. Instead, Toucannon prefer to communicate by smacking beaks with one another, varying the strength and number of hits to send different messages.","Yungoos have sharp teeth that can crush bone with little effort. They also possess strong stomachs with powerful digestive acids that make quick work of any meal; in fact, these stomachs take up much of their bodies, and Yungoos must search for food almost constantly in order to stay satiated. To hunt, Yungoos stake out a particular route and then patrol it back and forth for prey. They do not stray from their paths, which they try to set in areas safe from larger predators. This is because Yungoos do not nest and are strictly diurnal; once dusk arrives, these Pokémon will simply collapse onto the ground where they are standing and doze off. They strongly prefer live prey and will only scavenge as an absolute last resort. Yungoos are famous for being introduced in the Alola region to combat booming Rattata populations. However, this measure of biological control failed miserably; rather than being wiped out, Alolan Rattata simply became nocturnal (to avoid these diurnal predators) and moved further into cities (which Yungoos consider unsafe). Now, Yungoos are abundant in Alola, both in urban and natural habitats, and pose a potential danger to other local species.","In many respects, Gumshoos are polar opposites of their pre-evolutions. For instance, their hunting patterns are the exact reverse of those of Yungoos; instead of patrolling routes in search of prey, Gumshoos wait in hiding near the routes of their victims before leaping out to surprise them. Naturally, it takes them some time in order to learn about their prey, so these Pokémon will often go days without food as they hone in on their targets (once again a contrast to the voracious Yungoos). Gumshoos will spend whole days simply watching their victims without striking. These Pokémon are tenacious and will stick to a single target until they succeed. One trait these Pokémon do have in common with Yungoos, however, is that they are also diurnal. When the sun sets, Gumshoos will fall asleep right where they stand, exhausted from a day’s worth of keeping watch. Gumshoos do have a preference for Alolan Rattata and Raticate, which is why they were imported in the first place. They are rarely able to hunt them, however, because of how their prey have adapted. Though normally quite patient, Gumshoos will get very excited when they sight an unfortunate wild Rattata.","Grubbin have strong mandibles that they use for almost everything. They use them to burrow underground, for instance, where they spend the majority of their time. Grubbin also use their jaws to scrape away at the bark of trees and feed on exposed sap. In order to stay safe from avian Pokémon, Grubbin often make their homes near or in the habitats of Electric-type Pokémon, as Flying-types are weak to them and usually avoid places where they congregate. They will use their mandibles to dig their nests into the soil. They also love electrical energy and will feed from power plants from time to time despite not being Electric-types themselves. It is believed that Grubbin gradually store this electricity within themselves as they prepare for evolution into Charjabug. Though very slow on the ground, Grubbin can escape from peril by shooting sticky threads to attach themselves to branches or wires and then swing away like tiny acrobats. Once they are safely away from danger, they can simply cut the strands with their sharp mandibles to free themselves. They can also bind attackers with these threads to slow them down and buy time to flee. Smaller avian Pokémon like Rookidee are often wary of tangling with Grubbin because of their powerful mandibles.","Charjabug are a bit more active than other intermediate insects, though this isn’t saying much. Unlike Metapod or Cascoon, Charjabug are capable of consuming solid foods. They are opportunistic feeders that eat whatever plant matter they can find nearby, including decaying humus. Charjabug still strive to remain as immobile as possible in order to store energy for evolution, however. They will often leave themselves half-buried in the ground while resting. Charjabug use what little food they eat to produce electrical energy using special organs in their abdomens; they can also siphon power from generators, and in fact seem to prefer this (as this method does not require movement). They then store this energy inside electric sacs within their bodies, which they can utilize to defend themselves from foes by discharging electricity from the tips of their jaws. Their sturdy shells also help keep them protected from predators. Charjabug can lend their stored electricity to allies and appliances; one Charjabug can power a whole house for a day, making them popular partners when camping. In fact, their evolutions Vikavolt will hold and draw electricity from them to defend themselves.","Though avian Pokémon usually hunt insects as a standard source of prey, most fear Vikavolt and choose to avoid them at all costs. This is because these creatures can deliver devastating blasts of electricity to take down Flying-type foes. Vikavolt possess powerful electrogenetic organs within in their abdomens that can quickly generate large amounts of energy. They can focus this energy within their large mandibles before quickly firing precise beams of crackling electricity at foes. To bolster their already-powerful attackers, Vikavolt will also grasp their pre-evolutions, Charjabug, in their ​legs as they fly, using them as additional energy sources (since Vikavolt are defending their relatives by doing this, the Charjabug usually don’t mind). However, the extra weight slows them down somewhat and makes it harder for them to fly. They will drop their loads when they need to reach maximum speed or make a sharp turn. Vikavolt are very fast, agile fliers that can easily navigate through the twisting branches of woodlands. They confound enemies with complex aerial maneuvers before firing off crackling beams of electricity from their jaws to take them down.","Crabrawler are feisty, scrappy creatures that “converse with their fists,” so to speak. They use their powerful claws to shield their vulnerable faces and stomachs in battle as they wait for their opponents to leave openings for them to strike. They also use these claws to strike trees and knock down Berries. Crabrawler will compete beneath trees for choice fruit in a manner quite similar to two boxers in a ring. Crabrawler have strong competitive spirits and despise losing; a defeated one will foam at the mouth as it faints. Bizarrely, these Pokémon have a strong affinity for heights. They will climb trees and buildings in order to reach the highest points in an area; they are even known to climb tall people. They will cling on tightly to these places once they reach them, punching those that try to pry them away. Crabrawler will often climb Alolan Exeggutor in search of Berries as well as higher ground, but this usually upsets the giant Pokémon and results in an unfortunate aftermath for the Crabrawler. Because of their competitiveness, only a single Crabrawler can usually remain at a local high point] at a given point in time. Crabrawler use their claws so much that they sometimes fall off from eventual wear and tear. The appendages are often harvested for their sweet, rich meat, though they contain very little of it.","As Crabrawler continue to search for new high points in their habitats, they begin to ascend higher and higher up into the mountains. They compete with one another for spots along the way; eventually, a select few of them will reach the very peaks of such ranges. Those that do reach these snowy summits will evolve into Crabominable. These Pokémon have evolved thick fur to insulate themselves from the bitter cold. Berries and other plant life are very scarce at such altitudes, so Crabominable instead feed on low-growing moss and lichens. They use their powerful claws to smash through layers of hard permafrost and access the soil beneath. Though predators are scarce where they dwell, Crabominable can lop off and fire their claws like rockets to defend themselves. The claws will grow back in just about a week’s time. Their claws also stay quite cold even outside of their snowy environments, allowing them to deliver icy blows wherever they are. Crabominable seem to oddly throw punches about as they travel, punching what seems to be nothing almost constantly. It is said many unexplained noises heard by mountain hikers can be attributed to Crabominable punching blindly in blizzards. This punching does sometimes come in handy, though; Crabominable can punch hard and fast enough to break an safe clearing through a crashing avalanche.","Oricorio have adapted different forms to suit each island of Alola; each one has its own typing and dance style, and Oricorio can swap between them by sipping nectar from native flowers. Fire-typed Baile Style Oricorio have drank red nectar on Ula’Ula Island. They are said to be the most passionate, dancing so intensely that they shed down everywhere as they move. They can flap their wings to ignite this down, bathing foes in fiery yet awesome bursts of flames. Oricorio that sip yellow nectar from Melemele Island adopt the Pom-Pom Style. These Electric-type Oricorio rub their feathers together to generate static and shock foes with punches. Their cheery moves perk up gloomy onlookers. Pa’u Style Oricorio have sipped the pink nectar of Akala Island and are Psychic-typed. They are said to dance in honor of the Alolan guardians, and their swaying is believed to hone in their psychic powers; they sometimes become so entranced that they may fail to hear their trainers' orders. Finally, the purple nectar of Poni Island is associated with Ghost-typed, Sensu Style Oricorio. Reminiscent of Kanto dances, their movements are said to draw upon nearby spirits for power, and are said to summon curses on their enemies to disable them.","Cutiefly can sense the auras of other living things. These minute creatures can observe their colors and brightness to identify living beings from afar and even gauge how they are feeling. Cutiefly use aura to find flowers that are just about to bloom to feed on their nectar and pollen. Eldegoss pollen is a particular favorite of theirs. They often compete with Butterfree for flower patches. It is said that people and Pokémon that are feeling especially strong emotions, whether positive or negative, have auras that resemble that of blooming flowers. For this reason, many Cutiefly may fly around the heads of those experiencing passionate feelings, expecting to find pollen. These Pokémon are often drawn to cities because of the many emotions present within people and Pokémon. They become especially common in urban areas during major holidays and festivals. In regions where Cutiefly are abundant, it is customary to leave out fresh flowers during large celebrations so that Cutiefly drawn to area, mistaking the multitude of emotions for a blooming field, can still find food and leave satiated. When threatened, Cutiefly use this ability to sense where opponents might strike next and evade them accordingly; the sight of larger Pokémon being outmaneuvered by tiny Cutiefly is often an amusing sight to behold.","Ribombee can be seen flitting about blooming meadows in search of nectar and pollen. They collect these substances and combine them with some of their salivary enzymes to create Pollen Puffs, held together by evaporatively-thickened nectar. These Pollen Puffs have very long shelf lives, so Ribombee can store them in their nests or tree hollows as a ready food supply once their nearby flowers wilt. Not all Pollen Puffs are made the same; Ribombee are known to collect extracts from various plants to enhance their Puffs. Some may contain poisons and irritants for use when protecting themselves, for instance, while others may contain stimulants or relaxants to improve the moods of themselves and others. People often raise Ribombee to create nutritious specialty Puffs, which can be sold as supplements. Ribombee are covered in fluffy hair that hold onto pollen as they travel between flowers. Rain significantly hinders their efforts, however, so they keep a close eye on the weather when traveling, monitoring moisture and wind conditions. The presence of Ribombee is a good sign that fair conditions will continue, as it is said that they will not appear unless a few clear days are to follow. If rain is approaching, Ribombee will seek shelter in their tree hollow nests and enter a dormant state until they sense better conditions.","Rockruff have incredibly popular Pokémon both amongst trainers and non-trainers alike for centuries. They are considered great Pokémon for children because of their friendliness as well as their ability to grow in personality alongside them. Young Rockruff are initially gentle, easygoing creatures. As they grow, however, they gradually become brasher and more rambunctious. Because Rockruff are popular amongst beginning trainers, many are unfortunately abandoned at this stage by those unprepared for this sudden shift in personality. Once they near evolution, they will begin to venture outside to howl at the moon at night; one night, they will leave their trainers and then return as evolved Lycanroc. Rockruff are fiercely loyal no matter how old they are; they have great senses of smell and will never forget an odor, allowing them to find loved ones regardless of time or distance. They will rub their stony collars onto their trainers to greet them; though many find this uncomfortable or even painful, it is simply a sign of affection. Rockruff also have an uncanny ability to sense when their trainers ones are upset and try their best to cheer them up; they are persistent in all aspects of life, including battle.","Rockruff can evolve into Midday Form or Midnight Form Lycanroc depending on the time of day. A select few Rockruff can also evolve into Dusk Form Lycanroc in the evening. Solitary Midday Form Lycanroc dislike needless fighting and stay away from others because of it. However, they are fiercely loyal to trainers that have raised them since they were Rockruff, especially those that stayed by their sides even when they were acting rebelliously. These Lycanroc are blisteringly fast, using their speed to bewilder foes before attacking them with the jagged rocks in their manes; their claws and fangs are also very sharp. Broken fragments of their stones are seen as good luck charms in Alola. Midnight Form Lycanroc are also solitary, and specialize in countering attacks; they will goad foes into striking by drawing close and taunting them before crushing them against their rocky manes with enough force to shatter bone. They do not mind pain; in fact, the fervor of battle against strong foes causes their eyes to glow red and their blood to boil. It is said these Lycanroc may begin to foster resentment towards trainers that restrict their tactics, but deeply trust those that capitalize on their strengths. Finally, the rare Dusk Form Lycanroc are quite calm and stoic, but become very heated in combat. Not much else is known about this elusive form.","Wishiwashi are small, defenseless Pokémon on their own. Because they are so easy to catch and are notably tasty, they are popular prey for many marine Pokémon. However, predators must act fast to catch these frail creatures. If they fail to take one by surprise, they must cut their losses and flee. When Wishiwashi sense danger, their eyes will begin to water; the wobbling tears glisten in the light and signal to other nearby Wishiwashi that it is time to group up. These signals can reach up to 25 miles (40 km) away in clear waters. Schooled together, these monstrous School Form Wishiwashi are feared even by apex predators like Gyarados. They are known as “demons of the sea” because of their fearsome might—when each Wishiwashi in a school uses Water Gun, the combined attack is stronger than a Hydro Pump. Wishiwashi cannot eat or sleep properly in their School Forms, however, so they cannot remain in these states indefinitely. Schools will seek secluded areas of the sea away from predators to safely disperse in before returning to their normal lives. If a School Form Wishiwashi is sufficiently damaged or loses enough members, its uniquely synchronous cooperation deteriorates, and it begins to behave more like a normal school of fish.","Mareanie have posed an ecological headache for conservationists for decades. They feed almost exclusively on the horns of Corsola, both discarded and still-growing. Because the reefs formed by shed Corsola horns are so integral to the ecosystems of tropical waters and house many different species of Pokémon, researchers closely observe Mareanie populations to ensure that they remain in check. These Pokémon do not seem to discriminate between fresh and discarded horns, so Corsola populations in areas where Mareanie are found have evolved to shed their horns prematurely in case of predation. Once they have cleared a space of Corsola horns, they will trawl the sea floor in search of more. If they come across they come across live Corsola, they will plunge the large poison spikes on their heads into them to subdue them. Once weakened, Mareanie will use their ten spiked tentacles to finish them off. Mareanie can also extend their tentacles slightly or fire their poison spikes to take down prey. These Pokémon can regenerate most of their bodies if damaged (other than their heads); they can recover whole tentacles in just about 24 hours. Corsola horn artisans despise Mareanie for consuming shed horns and will take near-excessive measures to keep them away from hidden stockpiles. Mareanie poison is slow-acting; the first symptom is numbness, followed by an uncontrollable swelling and itching. In colder regions like Galar, however, some Mareanie populations have been reported feeding on species other than Corsola.","Like Mareanie, Toxapex prey exclusively on Corsola and consequently thrive in the fragile reefs that their horns create. They crawl on the sea floor with their 12 tentacles in search of Corsola. Toxapex usually remain sheltered within their tentacles, which form a spiked, protective dome around their bodies. This dome also keeps them firmly rooted into the substrate beneath, allowing them to endure the crashing waves of an intertidal habitat. In colder climates, it insulates them from chilly waters by retaining heat within. Toxapex can invert their tentacles (and spikes), however, to launch poisonous spines at enemies. They use their poison to subdue Corsola as they crunch on their horns. Unlike Mareanie, Toxapex seem to try to keep Corsola alive as they feed; that way, their horns can regrow and allow Toxapex to feed once more in the future. Somewhat macabrely, this actually makes them less of a danger to reefs than Mareanie, as they do not outright kill Corsola (though the destruction of their horns is still a significant threat to reefs). Toxapex are a concern to divers, however, as it is easy to accidentally step on them when exploring. Their poison, created by a sac within their bodies, remains in the system for three days, causing intense pain, with some aftereffects lingering for a week. It is virulent enough to incapacitate a Wailord if injected.","Mudbray are commonly seen on farms and ranches, where they are raised for their sturdiness and strength. They can carry loads weighing over 50 times their own body weight on their backs or dragged behind them. Mudbray used to be common across the world, where they roamed muddy plains and badlands. Because of their stamina, however, hunters often viewed Mudbray and especially their evolutions Mudsdale as challenging game. Large herds of Mudbray were eventually hunted to extinction because of this, with only domesticated populations remaining. This is true, at least, everywhere but Alola. Mudbray still roam free on the islands, where they were able to escape the overhunting that decimated those on the mainland. Mudbray love to eat and play in mud. Though they are usually compliant Pokémon when doing so, they can become very defiant when deprived of mud. If kept from it for too long, they will firmly refuse to move entirely until they are allowed to play in the muck. After eating dirt, Mudbray will combine it with water and other substances inside their bodies to create a special mud that they coat their hooves with. This mud gives them the traction necessary to cross both rough and slippery terrain with ease.","Mudsdale are famed for their might and fortitude. Domesticated individuals are a common sight on ranches; they are also used to help travelers transverse rugged terrain, which they have adapted to cross with ease. Though they once were common across the world, they now only roam wild in Alola, as hunters saw their resilience as a challenge and hunted them to extinction everywhere else. In addition to their physical sturdiness, Mudsdale are also emotionally solid; they keep calm even in dire situations. Their hooves are coated in thick mud that adds weight to their kicks. They can pulverize cars with a single blow. Their heavy stomps can also blow holes in asphalt, however, so they are forbidden on some roads. Though slow, Mudsdale can carry over 10 tons for over three days without rest. It is said they could cross an entire region holding this weight without breaking a sweat. Mudsdale chew dirt and mix it with their saliva to create a special mud, which they spit out and use to cover their bodies and hooves; this mud is resistant to wind and rain, protecting them from the elements as they travel. People used to coat the walls of their homes with Mudsdale mud to provide insulation.","Dewpider have gills that enable them to breathe underwater. However, while they spend much of their time in the water, they primarily hunt for prey on land. To ameliorate this incongruity, these Pokémon have evolved the ability to create bubbles of water around their heads, forming them by excreting water and proteins from their rears. They use their arms to stabilize these bubbles as when they surface. Though their heads are soft and vulnerable, their bubbles help soften the impact of blows in this area. In fact, Dewpider use their bubble-covered heads to hunt and defend themselves; they can smash their craniums into victims with so much force that the initial impact feels much more solid than mere water, thanks to the surface tension that holds the bubbles together. Their soft heads are protected all the while by the liquid. Because of this technique, however, Dewpider are actually unable to hunt prey at all underwater, as their bubbles do not function the same way in an aquatic medium. These Pokémon also have a fear of sharp objects, like thorns, which can pierce and drain their water bubbles. Dewpider gauge dominance through the sizes of their helmets; Dewpider with larger bubbles can assert greater claims to territory.","Like Dewpider, Araquanid can be found prowling near the water’s edge in search of prey. Their bubbles become sturdier upon evolution; Araquanid can stay on land for a day’s time without suffocating. The bubbles are also stable enough to remain in place without having to be constantly held. Araquanid hunt insects and mammals by ramming their heads into them; they will use their heads to pin them against the ground or another surface until they eventually drown. Smaller creatures sometimes get sucked completely into their bubbles and become unable to escape on their ​own. Araquanid can also launch bubbles from their legs to capture small prey within from afar. Araquanid take their time feeding and will use their bubbles to store leftovers after meals, sharing them with Dewpider that can \"swim\" entirely within their bubbles. Although they appear very menacing, Araquanid do seem to have soft spots for creatures in need—when they are not hungry, that is. When they come across aquatic Pokémon stranded on land, they will bring them into their water bubbles and escort them back to safety. Unfortunately, they do not seem to differentiate between aquatic and terrestrial life; they sometimes try to “rescue” land-bound species only to end up drowning them. They are known to store things in their bubbles to keep them protected; Araquanid trainers may find their Pokémon trying to envelop them in their helmets when they feel the need to protect them.","Fomantis lurk in the tall grasses of jungle clearings, where towering trees have fallen and sunlight can reach the forest floor. These creatures are actually nocturnal; they are asleep while resting in these clearings, using the grass as cover from predators. As they sleep, they release a sweet, invigorating odor. Cutiefly are can be seen buzzing around them, as their auras seem to resemble that of flowers about to bloom. Fomantis spread the four leaves on top of their heads to gather light through photosynthesis as they sleep to make energy. They need plenty of sugars so that they are vibrantly colored upon evolution into Lurantis and will viciously attack those that disturb them during this process. Though they can wield powerful, ranged attacks like Solar Beam, this greatly drains them of energy, so they rarely do so. When night falls, Fomantis awaken, close their leaves, and begin to search for new clearings, as they may vulnerable to predators if they remain in one place for too long. They continue this routine—sleeping in sunlight and relocating during the night—until they evolve.","Once Fomantis gather sufficient energy from sunlight, they evolve into Lurantis. Lurantis utilize their vibrant coloration to disguise themselves as flowers and lure in prey (though some scientists suggest that they may also do this to hide from certain key predators). They further this charade by emitting a sweet floral scent. Some people regard Lurantis as the most beautiful of all Grass-types; it takes a great amount of effort to maintain their appearances, however, as they require a lot of sunlight and nutrients to thrive. Lurantis grow very close to trainers that take meticulous care of their appearances, but dislike lazy ones that let their colors dull. Some hobbyists strive to raise the most beautiful Lurantis possible, paying close attention to variables like diet and temperature. These Pokémon have sickle-like petals to slice prey cleanly in two. The petals can also concentrate gathered sunlight into beams when using the move Solar Blade. Such attacks are said to drain them of a bit of their color, however. These beams can cut straight through steel plates. When Lurantis attack, their movements are so elegant that they are often likened to dancing.","Morelull are nocturnal creatures that spend the day dozing in the shade of trees; they prefer to dwell in permanently-dark woodlands. While resting, they root their mycelium into the soil and passively draw nutrients; they can also attach to the roots of trees to directly drain resources. When night falls, they relocate to new trees in order to avoid draining areas entirely of their nutrients and killing the plants living in them. Morelull can extend their mycelium surprisingly deep into the soil. By connecting them with others of their kind, they can form complex communication networks and send messages to one another from far away. These Pokémon can scatter illuminated, pulsating spores from their caps, which can also glow softly. Watching these spores flicker has a noticeable soporific effect. Eventually, the spores will explode in bright, glittering pulses that other Morelull can interpret as various signals, most commonly one warning of danger. There has been a recorded incident of a pilot in a low-flying plane spooking a troop of Morelull and being subsequently blinded by the intense flashes of light; luckily, no one was hurt. Though discouraged by most safety regulations, nighttime Morelull forest tours are popular amongst some tourists who wish to see their mesmerizing spores. Morelull caps are a popular treat for forest Pokémon; luckily for Morelull, the caps grow back within the day if removed.","Folklore of communities near Shiinotic habitats often warn travelers to avoid the forest at night so as to not anger the “mushroom people.” These tales caution about Shiinotic; these Pokémon release flickering, glowing spores that induce drowsiness in those that gaze upon them. Staring for too long will cause a person to begin to lose their sense of direction, memory, and even time perception. It is said that those that reach this point of disorientation are doomed to never return from the forest. Shiinotic have a disturbing lack of ability to distinguish between live and dead prey; they will root their finger-like mycelium into victims, whether they are already dead and decomposing or simply dazed by their spores, to sap away at their energy. Travelers that notice pulsating lights deep within the woods should steer away. Shiinotic seem to communicate with one another in ways humans cannot detect; scientists believe that their flickering spores or perhaps mycelium networks may play a role in this. Regardless of how they converse, these Pokémon seem to work together to ensure that the prey that they select remain unable to escape. They are a surprisingly cooperative species and are known to \"share\" sapped life force with one another through their mycelium.","Salandit dwell in dry, arid areas with plenty of crags to scurry in and out of. They often make their homes near the sites of active volcanoes. These Pokémon are not very strong, so they rely on stealth and deception to outwit foes. Salandit can combust the bodily fluids produced by their venom sacs to create flames and release them from the bases of their tails. This ignition also produces toxic gases as a byproduct, which Salandit can also emit from the same place. The fumes have an oddly sweet aroma; those inhaling it often do not even realize that they are breathing poison until they feel lightheaded and dizzy. Given enough time, even the strongest and most resilient Pokémon will begin to feel its effects. Salandit prefer to sneak up on prey from behind and immobilize them with their fumes before the victims even notice. Humorously, Salandit have great trouble hunting Spinda, as their dizzying gases have little effect on these tipsy Pokémon. Female Salandit also have the ability to release pheromones that can influence males, both of other Pokémon as well as of humans. The longer a being inhales a Salandit’s pheromones, the further it falls under its control. When endangered, female Salandit may call upon the males of the area to come to its aid, amplifying the amount of poisonous gases released. Male Salandit will deliver most of their gathered food to females, often leaving them quite malnourished.","Only female Salandit are able to evolve into Salazzle. Salazzle emit intoxicating pheromones that arouse interest from male of all species, including humans. They use this ability to gather a reverse harem of male Salandit that will cater to their every whim. Salandit in a harem will gather food for their Salazzle and defend it from attackers. When displeased with the amount or quality of food a Salandit brings back, the head Salazzle will ignite her palms and slap it across the cheek. They are willing to lay down their lives for their leader in the name of “love.” Salazzle can also defend themselves with noxious fumes and flames, but they rarely elect to do so, instead sending in Salandit after Salandit to battle in their places. Salazzle produce far more potent gases than their pre-evolutions, however, which can be diluted significantly to produce tantalizing perfumes. Such products are often very costly and touted as aphrodisiacs. When mating season arrives, Salandit will forgo eating and sleeping to search for gifts to bring back to their Salazzle in hopes of earning their favor. Salazzle will choose a single lucky Salandit to mate with, while the rest will have to wait another year to try again. Female Salazzle with larger harems assert dominance over those with fewer Salandit under their control.","Stufful are very popular Pokémon; they serve as the mascot of a famous toy company, for instance, and stuffed versions of them can be found in nearly every toy store. With their adorable appearances, clumsy waddling, and supremely plush fur, it is easy to see how they can be so loved by popular culture. All of this belies the fact that Stufful are incredibly dangerous Pokémon, however. Though they seem innocent, they absolutely despise being touched by others. They will flail their limbs about spastically when prodded and do so with enough force to knock away a pro wrestler or even split a tree trunk down the middle. Stufful will only let their closest loved ones even begin to hug them. Unfortunately, because of their popularity, some people have tried to adopt Stufful as pets; usually, this goes very poorly, leaving stray Stufful wandering about cities around people that want nothing more than to cuddle with them. Since trash cans provide a steady food source for these Pokémon, however, they often remain in metropolises despite the risk of being touched, posing danger to unwary passerby. The short tail-like appendage on their rears is actually a scent organ that releases odors to communicate with other Stufful; they seem to hate being touched here even more than they do anywhere else.","Though they seem benign, Bewear are actually one of the world’s most dangerous Pokémon; Alolans often refer to it as the archipelago's most powerful Pokémon of all. Warning signs (oftentimes broken) demarcate their habitat boundaries in many areas; some even forbid all but the most experienced trainers from entering. Bewear possess absolutely immense strength; what makes them dangerous, however, is that they seem to be unaware of their might. These Pokémon swing their arms about absentmindedly as they lumber through forests, snapping trees in two as they go. Bewear are also very affectionate, showing their love by hugging. They hug with enough force to snap a human spine; indeed, this has historically been a not-uncommon fate of their trainers. Those brave—or foolhardy—enough to raise Bewear must be first be cleared by their local branch of the Pokémon League. Additionally, they must prove that they have successfully trained their Bewear to use nonlethal force in everyday situations. Bewear learn new fighting techniques by watching people and Pokémon train in the woods. Though their facial expressions won't change when angered, they will swing their arms about wildly as a warning before charging; this is universally considered a signal to start running away as fast as possible. After taking down prey, Bewear will tuck the carcasses under their arms and carry them back to their nests. Oddly, these Pokémon detest having their noses touched.","Bounsweet hop around tropical jungles, bouncing along on their springy bottoms. They constantly exude a sweet, fragrant aroma from their entire bodies. Many people find this scent calming, and some even let Bounsweet live in their homes as natural air fresheners. Unfortunately, their fragrance often attracts many predators; Toucannon are known to swallow Bounsweet whole with their large beaks. Though Bounsweet are far too saccharine for human consumption, their sweat can be harvested and watered down to create a refreshing juice. This sweet sweat is also excreted when Bounsweet exert themselves, ironically making them even more appetizing as they run for their lives. Bounsweet concentrate is sold in jugs specifically for this purpose in a number of supermarkets. Though their heads are quite soft, their calyxes are actually as hard as wood. They can spin their calyxes rapidly to drive off predators, but doing so makes them very dizzy. Additionally, Toucannon have beaks strong enough to crack their calyxes, so this defense is unfortunately often fruitless. They will hop aimlessly for some time after spinning. Since bouncing is their only form of locomotion, these Pokémon look happy even as they are fleeing desperately from danger. Studies show that Bounsweet are not very intelligent Pokémon, with some scientists suggesting that they may not even comprehend the threat of danger until a predator is actively chasing it down.","Steenee have harder sepals than their pre-evolutions. Because of this, they no longer have to fear nearly as many predators, particularly avian Pokémon like Corvisquire that cannot peck through this defense (especially when more-easily eaten Bounsweet are around). Steenee are lively, friendly Pokémon that exude an aroma even sweeter and more pleasant than Bounsweet. They can be a bit rough when playing, however, as they pay little attention to their surroundings or to others. Ironically, the avian Pokémon that once preyed on them as Bounsweet now often find themselves battered by Steenee as they try to \"play\" with their winged companions. Their calyxes spin around idly as they walk, knocking over objects and smacking into people and other Pokémon. They sometimes will not even notice when things fall onto their heads from above, as they usually bounce harmlessly off of their sepals. In battle, Steenee first strike enemies with their hard calyxes to stun them before delivering strong kicks to finish them off. Their legs are actually just as hard as their calyxes, as they are made of the same material. It is said that the more a Steenee is allowed to play freely, the sweeter its aroma will become. When Steenee twirl, they diffuse their aroma into the surrounding air. This scent is thought to promote happiness in those who smell it.","Tsareena carry themselves like royalty, being regal in both appearances and personality. Their cold gazes can freeze enemies in their tracks, and they punish aggressors with grace and elegance. Tsareena are masters in the high-kicking; they can deliver flurries of kicks with their powerful legs to assail foes as they are intoxicated by their tantalizing fragrances, and can even knock out professional kickboxers with single blows. Inhabitants of tropical regions have taken to imitating their kicks in some styles of dance. Tsareena are known to laugh or scoff condescendingly after finishing off opponents, kicking them after they are down. It is said that a blow from the hard tips of a Tsareena's leg will leave a wound that will never heal, both physically and emotionally. They can be difficult Pokémon to manage. They will glare at trainers who give them poor commands and may refuse orders if they grow tired of them. Only a few Steenee evolve into Tsareena in the wild, as they require the blessing of the other Steenee to do so. Upon evolution, they are tasked with the job of protecting young Bounsweet. It is said that touching a Tsareena’s “crown” will drain it of its power. Thanks to their beautiful legs and appearances, Tsareena are a popular mascot for salons.","Comfey are popular Pokémon for their rejuvenatory and revitalizing abilities. They can even be found in hospitals and Pokémon Centers; in fact, they are as much as a staple in the Pokémon Centers of Alola as Chansey or Audino are elsewhere. Comfey can grow thin vines from their bodies; these vines are detachable, but they ferry nutrients within them as long as they are intact. Comfey pick flowers and attach them to their vines, keeping them fresh and vibrant thanks to this flow of nutrients. Comfey also spread a sticky oil along their rings of flowers to enhance their scents and adhere them to their vines. The aromas wafting from their blooms can heal and comfort those around them. Comfey give their flower rings to those that they like, blessing them with good health (hence why they are so popular in hospitals). The vines keep the flowers alive for quite a long time. When endangered, they will toss their rings at foes to distract them as they flee. Sometimes, their attackers are so calmed by the scent that they do not even bother giving chase. Comfey feel barren without their flowers, however, and will quickly return to collecting more after tossing their rings.","Oranguru are solitary Pokémon that dwell deep in the canopies of rainforests. These mysterious creatures spend much of their time meditating in silence. Because of their silhouettes, people once thought Oranguru were humans living in the jungle, earning them the moniker, “the people of the forests.” Oranguru are very intelligent and craft tools and medicines with regularity. They assemble their fans, for instance, by binding leave together with their own fur. Young or injured Pokémon will visit benevolent Oranguru for food and medicine, and Oranguru will similarly stop to treat injured creatures they come across. These Pokémon are said to be as intelligent as Slowking; they have been observed comparing wits with one another in regions where their habitats overlap. Oranguru can be difficult to raise, as they look down on trainers less knowledgeable than themselves and tend to act on their own accords. They also don't get along well with others of their kind, engaging in intellectual battles of wits when encountering one another to prove superiority (and territorial claims). Shockingly, Oranguru have proven able to learn how to manipulate human inventions like Potions all on their own. Some have even reported seeing Oranguru use Poké Balls in the wild.","Passimian dwell in troops of 20 to 30 individuals. They are led by a “boss” Passimian, who fashions an arm marking of leaves that all other Passimian in the troop will bear to distinguish themselves; the leaves are stuck on using dried saliva. These Pokémon excel when it comes to teamwork. Bosses will select 10 of the fittest members to accompany them as they search for Berries; this is done on a case-by-case basis, so Passimian must constantly train themselves to stay in peak condition. Each Passimian in a team performs a particular assigned role when foraging. Bosses will routinely conduct training exercises in which troop members must pass Berries to one another both quickly and accurately. The Passimian that can throw a Berry the farthest is the de-facto leader. These sessions are often long and laborious; some Passimian even end up running away because they are unable to handle the pressure. Passimian lob Berries at foes to defend themselves. They use soft ones to obscure their vision and hard ones to batter and bruise them. Troop members will never leave a comrade behind. Bosses pass down special techniques from generation to generation. Passimian watch their trainers closely as they throw their Poké Balls; they look down on those with poor form.","Wimpod are notoriously cowardly creatures that will flee at the first sign of danger. Foreign sights and sounds spook these Pokémon; if one approaches a group of them, they will scatter in all directions. If cornered, Wimpod will spew a noxious, poisonous fluid as a last-ditch effort. The odor of this substance signals to other Wimpod that danger is near. Wimpod are scavengers that will gladly feed on any waste they can find. They can digest rotten food and even human trash with no ill effects; in fact, scientists believe that such a diet helps create its poisonous defenses. Their many legs scrape the ground as they scurry, cleaning the surface below. They are valued as beach and sea cleaners for this reason, helping mitigate the effects of human pollution in tourist destination spots. Despite their meekness, Wimpod are also curious and will approach unfamiliar objects if they have remained still for a long time. They have a habit of storing what they cannot eat, like Pearls or shiny coins; this makes them prime targets for treasure hunters and Murkrow and Meowth. Though the Wimpod themselves will scurry away if they sense someone approaching, one can easily find a Wimpod nest by noting the cleanliness of the surrounding sand.","Surprisingly, meek and frail Wimpod can potentially evolve into large and menacing Golispod. Despite their intimidating stature, however, Golisopod are peaceful creatures. They spend most of their time meditating silently deep beneath the sea in underwater caverns or sunken ships. These Pokémon also try to avoid needless conflict; they do not hunt, instead feeding on kelp, algae, and discarded refuse. However, Golisopod are well-equipped to defend themselves from danger. Their diamond-hard carapaces can shield them from most blows, while their sharp claws can slice with enough force to briefly cleave water or air right in two. Golisopod will try to fight as little as possible, only holding their foes off until they have an opening to flee and meditate in peace. Some say that this is a remnant of their skittish behavior as Wimpod, while others assert that this is a strategical decision that helps them save energy. When cornered, though, these Pokémon will do whatever it takes in order to neutralize the threat, taking advantage of every opening and using their small front claws to finish foes off. Golisopod are both a common prey and predator of Grapploct, who will frequently (and against their will)  initiate fights with them. Wild Golisopod are sometimes found surrounded by Wimpod; whether this relationship is protective or merely friendly is unknown. Golisopod rarely venture onto beaches, as their appearances often frighten swimmers into attacking them; this spooks them into fleeing.","Sandygast are said to be born when supernatural forces possess mounds of sand built by children. Some say this is done by spirits of the dead, while others believe that they are possessed by the manifested grudges of people and Pokémon. Sandygast dwell on sandy beaches, where they blend in perfectly with their surroundings. They use their bright red shovels to lure in small children; those who grab their shovels fall under their influences and are compelled to begin adding more sand to their bodies, making them larger. If a Sandygast loses its shovel, it may instead temporarily use a tree branch, flag, or other sturdy object it finds on the shore until it can find its shovel again. They are very protective of these tools and will try their best to fight to regain them if stolen. Sandygast can suck the life force of living beings with their gaping mouths. In Alola, it is a test of courage to stick one’s hand in a Sandygast’s orifice. Obviously, beach-going parents warn their children to not play with wild Sandygast or grab their red shovels. Incidence rates of such occurrences, however, have remained stagnant for decades despite these warnings. Children playing on beaches where Sandygast are known to be found are warned to knock down piles of sand they build before leaving in order to prevent possible possessions.","As Sandygast compel children to add sand to their bodies, they will become larger and larger. Eventually, they will possess them to shape their sand into the form of a castle, evolving into Palossand. Palossand are now strong enough to control adults as well as children; they can also build themselves up with sand on their own without having to wait for children to grab their shovels. In fact, their shovels are no longer even used for possession; instead, they slowly spin around and function as radars to help Palossand locate prey. These Pokémon blend in seamlessly with the sand as they search for food; it is said that each one of their individual grains is animated with its own life force. When Palossand find small Pokémon, they can create powerful whirlpools of sand to drag down them down. They drain their prey’s life forces as they suffocate, leaving their dry bones beneath them. It is said that what little trace of their ill will remains then possesses piles of sand to create new Sandygast. They can also whip up sandstorms to blind prey and cause them to stumble into their waiting traps. Palossand can use damp sand to strengthen their bodies. Drawing too close to the crashing waves, however, can erode away at their crumbly forms.","Though Pyukumuku usually dwell in shallow seas, they often make their way onto shores as well. These stalwart creatures will not budge once they find a favored spot; they would first starve or dehydrate before moving. They are covered in viscous mucus that can keep them moist for a week on land. It can also be used as a moisturizer and sunburn treatment. Pyukumuku eat detritus and small invertebrates found in their immediate vicinities, ejecting their guts to engulf and digest their meals. Compassionate beachgoers will throw starving Pyukumuku back into the sea so they do not starve; since they are unappealing to tourists, some locales will even pay workers to chuck them away, though they will inevitably return. Workers must be wary of brushed their mouths or spikes; while they aren’t sharp, Pyukumuku hate being being touched in these areas and will expel their innards to attack those that do. Their guts form the shape of a flexible hand and are shot out to deliver powerful punches. Beachgoers must be wary of stepping on these small creatures for this reason.","The Alola-based Aether Foundation strove to create a weapon capable of defeating the mysterious, extra-dimensional Ultra Beasts. Taking inspiration from the mythical Arceus, its scientists combined DNA from Pokémon of all types to engineer a creature that could wield each in combat. Named, “Type: Full” and under the codename “Beast Killer,” they created three of these creatures and implemented them with what they called “RKS Systems.” These systems were intended to grant control over how Type: Full changed types, but all three subjects rejected their systems and went berserk. They were declared failures, bound with heavy helmets, and placed into cryostasis; they were also renamed “Type: Null”. The Beast Killer Experiments were kept secret from the public until an Aether Foundation defector escaped with a reanimated Type: Null. There are currently only three of these Pokémon in existence with no plans to create any more, as the ethics committee of the Pokémon League has deemed the Beast Killer Experiments in violation of research ethics. However, there are rumors that stolen research notes have allowed for the creation of additional Type: Null in at least one other region.","Though the scientists of the Aether Foundation declared the Beast Killer Experiments a resounding failure, they had actually been far more successful than they believed. Had they been able to calm Type: Full from their rampages, they may have realized that they would have eventually accepted the RKS Systems after all. Type: Full are officially known as Silvally, named by the Aether Foundation defector that successfully partnered with and raised his own Type: Null. Though still prone to berserk outbursts, these Pokémon are fiercely loyal to those who show them compassion even in such states. They will risk their lives to defend their allies. They have mustered the strength to destroy their own helmets and wield their RKS Systems; by inserting “Memories” created by the Foundation, they can assume the traits of any type. Parts of their bodies change color to signify their typings. One Silvally is partnered with the aforementioned defector, a second Type: Null was gifted to one of his acquaintances, and a third currently resides in Aether Paradise.","Origin stories regarding Minior vary wildly, ranging from the biological (evolutionary relations with other mineral-based Pokémon) to the astronomical (extraterrestrial creatures like Lunatone and Solrock) to the fantastical (mutations from tiny conglomerated nanoparticles). Regardless of how they came to be, Minior can now be found living most of their lives in the stratosphere, being especially abundant in the ozone layer. They collect and eat dust in the air, gradually becoming heavier. Eventually, they become heavy enough to fall to the earth; when they land, their shells break away to reveal their cores. These cores can wildly range in color depending on the elements present in the dust the Minior ate. Strong impacts can also fragment Minior shells. Without their protection, Minior are faster, but they are also more frail; they will eventually die from exposure after landing. Capture in Poké Balls will halt this process, however. Alolan designers commonly use colorful Minior Cores as a motif in apparel; Minior crashes are rare in most parts of the world, with certain regions of Alola being an exception; whether this is due merely to chance or rather to a gravitational or meteorological phenomenon is unknown.","Komala are born asleep, live asleep, and die asleep; these creatures have never been observed while awake. Despite their perpetual slumbers, however, Komala seem hazily aware of their surroundings; they seem to process outside stimuli within their dreams, as some sounds and physical touches register noticeably in their brain wave patterns. They exhibit expressions on their faces based on what they are dreaming about. When these Pokémon are attacked, they will begin to flail about in the general direction that they sense danger. Komala are given a log “pillow” by their parents when they are born. These logs act as security blankets, and these Pokémon will cling onto to them tightly. They are unable to sleep well without them, thrashing about wildly in their sleep. Trained Komala may instead latch onto their trainers’ arms for comfort, however. Komala saliva is intensely soporific; traditional Alolan medicine dictates that collecting Komala saliva left on tree leaves after feeding and diluting it in water will create an excellent sleeping aid. Recent studies suggest that their states of constant slumber may in fact be due at least in part to their diets; certain leaves these Pokémon consume have intensely soporific properties, which may be passed from mother to child prior to birth and then continually consumed as part of their everyday routines. ","Turtonator dwell volcanic areas cloaked with noxious fumes. They supplement their diets with a plethora of chemicals produced by volcanoes, primarily sulfuric compounds. Turtonator incorporate these volatile substances into their outer shell coatings. Then, they will lie belly-down on the floor to disguise themselves with rocks. When unwary prey wander onto them, Turtonator will strike their shells with their tails to trigger an explosion; their hard carapaces protect them from the impact, but their victims are usually blown apart. Turtonator will also use their explosive shells to shield themselves from attacks. When their spikes are struck, sparks will fly out from them and ignite their shell linings. Turtonator can also expel flames and poisonous gases from their nostrils; even their dung is explosive due to their diets (it is sometimes harvested for use in weaponry and fireworks). Turtonator have weak spots in the centers of their soft bellies, where they funnel explosive flames from their shells; strikes here will damage them greatly. Additionally, moisture and humidity severely hamper their explosiveness, so Turtonator will seek refuge in caverns during wet weather.","Togedemaru have triangular patches of long, needle-like fur that can stand together on end like spikes. When in danger, they can curl up into balls with their spikes raised to defend themselves from attackers. These spikes also help attract electricity during storms; the needle-like appendages on their heads, however, function much better as lightning rods for this purpose. They also help Togedemaru stay balanced, much like tails. When a thunderstorm is approaching, many Togedemaru will venture out into the open with their fur bristled, waiting patiently to be struck by bolts of lightning. They can also siphon electricity from other Electric-types using their spikes. Togedemaru store gathered electricity in electrical sacs within their bodies for use when protecting themselves. While they can generate their own electricity to a limited extent, the bulk of their charge is gathered during lightning storms. Predators that are foolish enough to attack curled-up Togedemaru will not only be pierced by their fourteen sharp spikes, but also be shocked as they let loose stored electricity. Togedemaru are known to share electricity with one another by directly shocking each other’s lightning rods and charging each other’s electrical sacs.","Mimikyu are said to be lonely spirits that want nothing more than to be loved. They cloak themselves in cloth to shield their bodies from light, as they like dark places. They have cut and colored their cloths to resemble Pikachu and are said to have taken inspiration from discarded Pikachu merchandise from the past few decades. Holding crooked sticks as “tails,” it is said that Mimikyu pose as Pikachu so they can be as beloved by people as the electric rodents. Mimikyu never reveal their true forms, as the sight of their uncovered bodies is said to be so repulsive and terrifying that those who ​see them die of shock or fall ill with disease. Though their disguises protect them from attacks, strong blows will snap their “necks” and ruin their hard work, saddening Mimikyu greatly. They will work tirelessly through the night to repair their costumes when they are broken. These Pokémon will react violently if one tries to peek underneath their cloths, and will also try and seek revenge on those that destroy their costumes. Mimikyu can extend shadowy black hands from beneath their disguises to grab things, but they avoid doing so around people to maintain the illusion that they are Pikachu.","Bruxish dig holes into the sand in the waters of warm coral reefs. They bury themselves and leave only their knobby protuberances exposed. These growths emit low levels of psychokinetic energy that allow Bruxish to sense living things around them, functioning much like radars. When they detect prey, they unearth themselves and attack. Bruxish stun their victims with pyschokinesis before using their hard teeth to grind away. Their teeth are strong enough to pulverize the shells and spikes of Shellder and Mareanie. Their thick skin additionally keeps them safe from the latter, making them keystone predators in Corsola reefs as they regulate Mareanie populations. When Bruxish emit psychic powers, their protuberances “bloom” and resemble flowers. Exposure to their abilities can cause headaches and eventually fainting. Bruxish grind their teeth when they use their powers. Other oceanic creatures know to flee the area when they hear the sound of their grinding; even Sharpedo evacuate when Bruxish sound off (though they are unaffected by the psychokinesis, Bruxish sometimes sneak up behind them and leave nasty gashes). Lifeguards let Bruxish remain in swimming areas for this reason.","Drampa are peaceful, solitary creatures that live high up in the mountains. They dwell at altitudes over 10,000 feet above sea level, where plant life can no longer survive. These herbivores descend to the feet of their mountains to gather Berries every day at dawn. They eat just enough to fuel their next climbs back up, taking a few Berries with them. Drampa are friendly with people, especially children. They will share their spare Berries with travelers, but they save the sweetest and juiciest ones for kids. Drampa will go out of their way to visit mountainside towns and play with the children living there, bringing gifts of Berries. They are often sighted in parks and near schools in the morning for this reason. Though they are usually peaceful creatures, Drampa will go berserk when children near them are in danger; they can blow down buildings with their gale-like attacks to defend young ones. They will also come to the defense of children that are being bullied by older ones. Mountain communities often have “patron” Drampa who visit the same area every day and get to know the inhabitants. These Drampa are beloved by children and parents alike.","Dhelmise are very odd Pokémon; few people know exactly what to make of them. The “living” portion of Dhelmise (with the term being used very loosely in this context) is actually the seaweed, said to be possessed by ocean spirits or even the reborn souls of the algae itself. The seaweed strands wrap themselves around the remains of ships, binding together their wheels, anchors, and other sunken instruments to form Dhelmise. Dhelmise swing their anchors around with great force to defend themselves; they can knock out giant Wailord with single blows from these swings. It is said that Dhelmise that are unable to find anchors to bind themselves to drift about aimlessly in the waves, indistinguishable from regular kelp. To feed, they extend their kelp up to hundreds of yards away, binding prey and draining their life force. They are known to whip up whirlpools by swinging their anchors around in order to draw prey in. In Alola, daring fishermen will intentionally seek out such vortexes because they can trap whole schools of fish within. Sailors say that kelp stuck to ship bottoms are Dhelmise that have been attracted to the steel vessels and are trying to weigh down and sink them for parts. Dhelmise actually add new seaweed and detritus to their bodies as they travel, though it is unknown if these new additions become “animate” as well. Recent studies suggest that Dhelmise may hold a mutualistic relationship with wild Skrelp, who lead them to patches of wild kelp and in return are protected by these mighty Pokémon.","Jangmo-o live in groups in harsh, barren areas. They often congregate in canyons and badlands far away from human settlements or even other Pokémon. Jangmo-o train diligently by battling one another; they take their practice very seriously and never miss a chance to further hone their skills. These Pokémon are said to have the hearts of warriors, as they will never turn their backs to foes and always remain humble about their fighting prowess. Jangmo-o use their hard scales to defend themselves from blows as well as attack enemies. Their scales make harsh, metallic clanging noises as they hit one another. Jangmo-o clang their scales to express emotions both in battle as well as in communication, making their habitats very noisy. Young Jangmo-o will clang scales together to build camaraderie and strength. Travelers will almost inevitably hear Jangmo-o in the wild before actually spotting them. Ancient tribes used to collect Jangmo-o scales and fashion war instruments out of them. They believed that ringing these instruments prior to battle would ensure their warriors fought bravely and valiantly. Anthropological excavations suggest that Jangmo-o were popular partners for military combatants in ancient Alolan society. Recently, scientists have found evidence that Jangmo-o scales are not, in fact, modified reptilian scales, but actually hardened fur; the implications of this finding have yet to be explored.","When Jangmo-o evolve into Hakamo-o, they leave their peers to continue their training on their own. Hakamo-o search their barren habitats in search of other living souls to spar with. They will travel quite far in order to find suitable partners. Before fighting, Hakamo-o will perform ritualistic dances in which they clang their scales about wildly, filling their surroundings with sounds of harsh ringing. At the peak of their fervor, they will emit war cries to signal to their opponents that they are ready for battle. Hakamo-o use their sharp scales to deliver slicing punches. These scales also help them deflect away enemy attacks, letting these Pokémon focus entirely on the offensive. Hakamo-o strike with such passion that they sometimes even tear off their own scales. Luckily, they will grow back almost immediately, sharper and sturdier than ever before. When Hakamo-o come across one another in the wild, they will brandish their bare arms to boast how many scales they have lost fighting ferociously in battle. Hakamo-o scales are very good conductors of heat. In traditional Alolan smithery, they are molded into pots and pans for cooking.","Once Hakamo-o fight enough opponents and grow strong enough, they finally evolve into Kommo-o. The mere clanging of a Kommo-o’s scales will strike fear in the hearts of many, spooking them away. This works in their favor, as Kommo-o detest fighting weak foes. These Pokémon will shake their tails as they walk to scare away other Pokémon from their paths; those that remain unmoving are worthy challengers willing to stand up to their might. Kommo-o return to their birthplaces after evolution. They watch Jangmo-o from afar, ensuring that they are safe without interfering with their training. Kommo-o wield devastating uppercuts that can send foes flying and even blow away parts of the surrounding landscape. They will also scrape their scales in battles to unnerve enemies, and jangle them after a victory to proudly announce their triumph. According to legend, Kommo-o possess glittering scales because they are destined to drive away darkness from the world; they fight to train and prepare for this duty. People used to grind up these scales for both ritualistic and mundane uses. According to paintings found in some Poni Island ruins, ancient Alolan warriors used to don ceremonial armor made almost entirely of Kommo-o scales.","Tapu Koko is the guardian deity of Melemele Island. Represented by the color yellow and residing in the Ruins of Conflict, it protects the island and its inhabitants. Tapu Koko is said to be able to generate thunderclouds and store lightning within its body, holding it inside its “mask” when it draws its arms together. It can fly faster than the human eye can see. Tapu Koko is thought to be a fickle guardian that is difficult to please. It can be angered easily, but also quick to forgive as well. Because of its capriciousness, it may not always come to the immediate aid of those in need. Tapu Koko is also curious and quick to investigate peculiar situations. It has a habit of playing with or battling island tourists and newcomers that it has not met before. According to residents of Melemele Island, Tapu Koko seems to choose the island kahuna almost arbitrarily; they also agree that its decision always seems to have been the right one in hindsight, however. According to Alolan legend, Tapu Koko is especially drawn to battle, overseeing both conflict and peace.","Akala Island residents look to Tapu Lele for safety. Represented by the color pink, Tapu Lele is said to be the most aloof or even wanton of the island deities. Tapu Lele is said to flutter about Akala Island, scattering its glowing scales below as it does; it rests in the Ruins of Hope. Touching these scales restores vigor and vitality. Touching too many at once, however, is said to overflow one’s body with energy and cause great harm. According to mythology, Tapu Lele scatters its scales indiscriminately with no regard for its effects. Oral legends speak of a war Tapu Lele ended by soothing the battlers with its powers; Akala Island elders, however, recall a different version in which the deity stopped the fighting by scattering so many of its scales that all of the warriors perished. Tapu Lele is linked with both the restoration and loss of life. Some legends say that it draws its power from the pink flowers of Akala Island. It stores its energy in its shell-like “mask,” holding onto it for dire situations. It is said to purposefully not finish battles to conserve strength for more important fights.","Represented by the color red, Tapu Bulu is the island guardian of Ula’ula Island in Alola. Associated with fertility and barrenness, Tapu Bulu is infamously known as the laziest island deity. Some say this is because it is a passive guardian, while others say it is because it is conserving energy, but no one quite knows for sure. Ula’ula Island residents do know, however, to not disturb Tapu Bulu when it does not wish to be bothered. When the residents of Tapu Village roused it many years ago, it destroyed the village in anger. Tapu Bulu is able to make plants grow. Its horns are made of wood and can be shaped to fulfill many uses. It is said to gather energy from the growth of flora, storing it in its mask. To fight, Tapu Bulu will command plants to snare its foes before ramming into them with its horns. It will also uproot and swing trees to attack those who disturb it while it is resting in the Ruins of Abudance. It detests those who intend harm and will fight to take them down. Tapu Bulu will ring its bell-like tail to warn approaching visitors to back away.","Tapu Fini watches over Poni Island. Represented by the color purple, it is said to be the most relaxed of the island deities. Tapu Fini seems to dislike humans, cloaking itself in thick fog to keep them away. According to legend, this is because it protects a source of purifying water; long ago, ill-willed people tried to steal this water from it, causing it to drive all humans away. Tapu Fini’s fog is said to manipulate the very minds of those who enter it, causing their deepest flaws to surface and leading travelers into destroying themselves. Tapu Fini will reward only those who can make it through its fog with its water. As the deity can manipulate water, it will constantly create more fog from the sea that surrounds Poni Island; it draws energy from ocean currents. Tapu Fini always appears emotionless, even when it attacks; some say this is because creating fog consumes so much of its energy. Residing in the Ruins of Hope, Tapu Fini oversees hope and despair in Alola; it induces despair in those that enter its fog, but restores hope to those that manage to reach its mystical water.","Mysterious Cosmog, while spoken of in Alolan legends for centuries, have only recently been discovered by other regions. In past centuries, only the kings of Alola and their confidants knew of them, though they only believed one existed; they called it “the child of the stars.” They eventually handed it over to the Aether Foundation, who promised to learn more about it; its researchers gave it the name “Cosmog.” Though its exact methods remain unknown, the Foundation was able to confirm that Cosmog were related to the Ultra Space dimension. They believed that they originated there and could open “Ultra Wormholes” that connected to it. Using this ability was reported to greatly weaken them, however, and they only did so to warp to safety when endangered. To grow and repair themselves, Cosmog gather atmospheric dust. Their light weight means they can be easily blown away, however (though this doesn't bother them much). Aether Foundation researchers reported that their Cosmog was very friendly and trusting, even in stressful situations. It often escaped its enclosure to greet familiar faces, unintentionally making some experiments difficult to conduct.","Extreme stress is said to trigger Cosmog’s evolution into Cosmoem. This phenomenon has only been observed once in recent times during an incident in the Aether Foundation headquarters, when the immense energy Cosmog expended to open an Ultra Wormhole led to the change. While gaseous Cosmog are light, Cosmoem are extraordinarily dense. Their black cores seem to hold most of their mass; it appears as if their core is actually slowly gathering matter and growing larger, supported by their hard golden shells. These shells seem to be harder than any substance known to man. Though Cosmoem are totally motionless, they are warm to the touch. Ancient Alolan legends suggest that (a singular) Cosmog has evolved into Cosmoem in the past, referring to it as “the cocoon of the stars;” one Alolan king had even built an altar in worship of it. Such myths state that Cosmoem originate from another world, and that they are gathering enough energy to return home. Cosmoem become heavier and warmer as they draw closer to this goal, gathering light from the sky above. Though Cosmoem are silent, a past Alolan king documented that he sensed that one desired to be bathed in sunlight; another king, however, wrote that Cosmoem longed for moonlight.","With the power of the sun, Cosmoem will evolve into the radiant Solgaleo. Solgaleo is referred to as “the beast that devours the sun” in Alolan myth and is said to be the male evolution of Cosmoem. It retains the vast amount of energy it had stored as Cosmoem, allowing it to radiate shining light from its body. When its flowing mane glows, Solgaleo is said to resemble a radiant sun, shining so bright that it can make even moonless nights appear as if if it is midday. Solgaleo can also harness the energy it had stored to create Ultra Wormholes to Ultra Space. When it uses this ability, a mystical “third eye” appears on its forehead. Solgaleo has the ability to create new Cosmog; for reasons unknown, it has sent Cosmog to Alola for centuries. Alolan rulers passed down mystical flutes used to facilitate the evolution of Cosmoem, as Solgaleo is said to protect Alola from great calamities. All references of this occurring in the past end the same, however; once Solgaleo finishes its task, it returns back home, with Cosmog appearing again sometime after.","The people of Alola worship Lunala as “the beast that calls the moon.” Said to be the female evolution of Cosmoem, Lunala uses its large wings to absorb light, which it converts into energy. As it spreads its wings to do so, it is said to resemble a beautiful crescent moon glistening in the night sky. For this reason, some also call it the lunar emissary (as opposed to Solgaleo’s designation as the solar emissary). It is said that when Lunala appears during the day, it will absorb all of the sun’s light and cloak the world in the darkness of night. Lunala can use its energy to open Ultra Wormholes to Ultra Space; it can also create new Cosmog with its powers. With the power of mystical flutes passed down through Alolan rulers, Cosmoem can evolve into Lunala. In the past, Alolan rulers called upon Lunala in times of great danger. Once the threat subsided, Lunala would open an Ultra Wormhole and return to its home dimension. Not long after, a new Cosmog would mysteriously appear in Alola; it was believed that the new Cosmog was still Lunala, but reincarnated.","Nihilego are mysterious creatures said to originate from Ultra Space. Little is known about them other than what has been declassified by the International Police or passed down in legend. Once coded as UB-01 Symbiont, Nihilego have recently entered public perception, as swarms of them briefly appeared in the streets of Alola. Onlookers reported that they seemed to sway like young girls; their bodies were glass-like and amorphous. A few witnesses adamantly recalled Nihilego attaching themselves to people and “infecting” them, causing them to suddenly act violently. This corroborates with the events of myth, as figures believed to be Nihilego were said to possess humans like parasites and cause them to act on their deepest desires; the island deities were the ones to defeat and banish them back to whence they came. Nihilego seemed to be of special interest to ex-Aether Foundation President Lusamine, who conducted her own personal experiments regarding it. Though released information has been heavily redacted, Foundation studies do suggest that this creature produces a strong neurotoxin-like substance. Other scientists found Nihilego oddly emotionless, with only some evidence of a survival instinct. Nihilego are believed to inhabit cavernous environments on their home world, though some believe that they may possibly be naturally aquatic creatures based on their physiology.","Buzzwole were depicted in Alolan mythology as giant, hulking beasts with long and slender noses. Recent appearances confirmed that legend was rather close to truth. Buzzswole possess “proboscises” that are stronger than diamond. Legends say that Buzzwole absorb energy from those around them, using it to fuel chemical reactions within their bodies and fill their muscles with more fluid, making them stronger. Recent witnesses of Buzzwole reported that the Pokémon seemed to flex their bodies very often, and almost always after attacking. Some said it seemed boastful, while others believed that they were trying to communicate. Indeed, every known instance of Buzzwole being depicted in Alolan artwork shows them in flexed poses. A few onlookers reported that they saw a Buzzswole pulverize a dump truck in a single blow. Confusingly, Buzzswole were given the codename UB-02 Absorption by the International Police; this means that they share the number with Pheromosa (UB-02 Beauty), though no explanation was given by the organization. Based on their apparent affinity for Alola's environment, Aether Foundation researchers hypothesized that Buzzswole in fact dwell in jungles on its home world.","Pheromosa were codenamed UB-02 Beauty by the International Police, sharing their number with Buzzwole for some undisclosed reason. Pheromosa is blisteringly fast, and most witnesses recall only seeing for split seconds, wondering if they have even seen them at all.  Some even reported that it dodged a lightning strike. According to the Aether Foundation, Pheromosa can move their fast-twitch muscles as fast as 120 mph (200 km/h); even more amazingly, they can accelerate to this speed nearly instantaneously. Pheromosa can also can produce a pheromone previous unknown to science. Exposure to it induces a significant hypnotic effect; Foundation scientists accidentally exposed to it during a breach recalled feeling mesmerized by Pheromosa’s beauty and grace. Pheromosa were traditionally depicted in all sorts of ways in Alolan mythology, as their great speed likely made them difficult to properly document. Oddly, Pheromosa seem to avoid touching as much as possible, recoiling their hands away from objects. Some say this is because they find our world “unclean”. Aether Foundation researchers believe that Pheromosa may live in a dry, desert environment on their home world due to their high tolerance for dehydration.","While many Ultra Beasts appeared somewhat lost in Alola, this was not true of Xurkitree (UB-03 Lighting to the International Police). Witnesses reported seeing these gangly beings, coming in a variety of sizes, beelining towards the local power plants and sapping electrical energy from them. According to Aether Foundation research, Xurkitree possess electrogenetic organs within their bodies that generate electricity, allowing them to let loose up to 1,000,000 volts at once; this number is actually an estimate, as the subject Xurkitree in fact caused the voltmeter to explode during testing. Inferring from the activity of the Electric-type Pokémon of our world, researchers believe that Xurkitree likely dwells in electricity-rich areas on their home world. Alolan mythology often depicts Xurkitree with their “tails” embedded into the ground. Researchers believe that they are able to draw electricity from the ground in this manner. Indeed, onlookers reported seeing these creatures do just this before letting loose shocks. They also claimed that they could hear loud crackling simply from being around Xurkitree, believing that they themselves emanated this energy. Scientists found that their bodies were similar to conductive electrical wiring in composition.","Titanic Celesteela were coded UB-04 Blaster by the International Police, strangely sharing their number with Kartana. When Ultra Beasts began appearing in Alola, witnesses claim to have seen Celesteela flying at high speeds high in the sky. Aether Foundation scientists found that Celesteela create and store flammable gases within their rocket-like arms. They ignite this gas to attack as well as to fly; their calculations showed that they could create enough force to propel themselves into space. Thus, they postulated that Celesteela may naturally dwell in open environments where they can take off and land easily. Celesteela can also inexplicably root themselves into the ground like plants, presumably to draw nutrients from the soil. Witnesses reported seeing Celesteela land in forests with fertile soil to do this, burning down surrounding trees upon takeoff with its arms. Though Celesteela do appear in Alolan mythology like other Ultra Beasts, some have noted striking similarities with a figure from Kanto legends as well. The figure also possessed plant-like qualities and the ability to fly like a jet, leading some conspiracists to believe a Celesteela may have appeared in Kanto before.","Though many were quick to notice hulking Ultra Beasts like Guzzlord and Celesteela, UB-04 Blade slipped by right under the noses of most. These minute beings seem unaggressive according to Aether Foundation research; however, their bodies are extraordinarily dangerous, as they are sharper than any weapon known in our world. Witnesses who spotted Kartana reported first noticing them when a large steel tower collapsed; it had been sliced in two by a Kartana simply floating right through it. These Ultra Beasts are also very light, as they seem to be made of a substance that is much like paper. This allows them to maneuver out of danger with ease, as well as to easily slice apart foes that continue to pester them. Kartana are also very vulnerable to heat and moisture, however. An Aether Foundation scientist noted that one of their most serious containment breaches occurred when a Kartana effortlessly sliced through its enclosure to escape a hot light placed near it. She noted that they were never able to design a suitable material to safely contain Kartana. The Foundation also believed that these creatures may have made their homes in forested environments, due to their preference for wooded areas in Alola.","Guzzlord were coined UB-05 Glutton by the International Police, and if rumors are to believed, are one of the most dangerous Ultra Beasts known so far. The International Police has declassified less information regarding Guzzlord than any other Ultra Beast, leading many to believe there is more to these mysterious beings. According to Alolan legend, Guzzlord devoured mountains, rivers, forests, and seas, eating constantly until they were stopped by the island guardians. Reports from the more recent Ultra Wormhole incident corroborate their insatiable hunger, with many claiming to have witnessed them devouring buildings and even large swaths of mountains whole, using their pincer-like arms to shovel matter into their gaping maws. Even the Aether Foundation admitted that they quickly found Guzzlord too dangerous to work with, though they did note that they never recorded one producing waste. Some of their scientists hypothesized that Guzzlord may even convert all of what they eat into pure energy because of this. The Aether Foundation hypothesized that any world that Guzzlord inhabit must be desolate, as these creatures would devour absolutely everything in sight.","The mysterious Necrozma was not discovered until very recently, when it was unearthed from deep underground in Alola’s Ten Carat Hill. It is said to have slumbered undisturbed for centuries. Historians have connected Necrozma with a similar figure in Alolan mythology that shares many of its traits; this figure was said to come from the sky in the same way the creatures we now know as Ultra Beasts did, leading many to believe that Necrozma is an Ultra Beast as well. Even Alolan elders wonder, however, why it would have remained in this dimension if this was the case, or why the island guardians have not dealt with it. Since no concrete evidence is present, the International Police does not consider Necrozma an Ultra Beast (though it is likely they keep an eye on it nonetheless). Necrozma is said to be darker than night itself. Its prism-like body is thought to refract light that enters it, allowing Necrozma to focus it into attacks. This creature is said to be extraordinarily vicious, firing lasers of concentrated light at anyone who dares disturb it as it voraciously searches for light to absorb. If it fails to consume enough, impurities build up in its body and turn it pitch-black, rendering it inert.  According to legend, Necrozma once attempted to consume the sun and the moon--possibly referring to Solgaleo and Lunala--in order to return to its original form, a radiant entity known as Ultra Necrozma. It hungered for both and desired to first hunt down one in order to harness its light and power to capture the other. Also called \"The Blinding One\" in the legend, Necrozma left the planet dark after absorbing all of its light before its inhabitants trapped it to prevent it from wreaking havoc elsewhere. The Sparkling Stones of Alola are said to be bits of Necrozma's armor, broken off during it's conflict with Solgaleo and Lunala.","Though Porygon hold the distinction of being the first Pokémon created entirely artificially, Magearna actually comes very close to this title. Engineered by a brilliant scientist 500 years ago, Magearna was created as a gift for a royal princess. It can understand human speech (though not speak it) and empathize with living beings; in fact, it can sense the thoughts and emotions of others as if it was its own. Because it can feel the physical and emotional pain of others, it works tirelessly to help them in their suffering. A device known as a Soul-Heart grants Magearna with these abilities; it was said to have been constructed using the life energy of other Pokémon and is its \"true body\", so to speak, making Magearna not entirely synthetic. When depressed or sleeping, Magearna can withdraw itself into the shape of a Poké Ball. It is said to have once been colored like a Poké Ball as well, much to the princess’s delight, but such hues are said to have faded with time. Some say Magearna lives in suffering, always feeling the pain of others, while others say it takes comfort in their joy as well.","Marshadow is a mythical Pokémon that is said to dwell entirely in the shadows--literally. It is said to have the ability to sink into the shadows of living things and objects, slinking about from shade to shade. According to legend, Marshadow gains power and knowledge about the beings whose shadows it is hiding in, learning about their movements, fighting style, emotions, and even thoughts. Given enough time, it can intimately learn these things better than the being itself, enabling it to get the upper hand in battle when the time is right to strike. Some say it learned its fighting technique by dwelling in the shadow of a famous martial artist for many years. Marshadow is believed to be able to cause nightmares, especially ones involving malevolent shadows moving just out of the dreamer's field of vision. Despite these abilities, this Pokémon is very cowardly and wary of confrontation; it is said to never engage in battle without first mimicking its target from darkness for an extended period of time beforehand, ensuring that the battle will be quick and in its favor once it begins. When Marshadow attacks, its normally-dark body flares up with a spectral glow, and it enters a form known as Zenith Marshadow.","While most Ultra Beasts have been alluded to in ancient Alolan myths, Poipole and its evolution Naganadel are uniquely absent from this tales. They were first documented by the International Police partnered with a mysterious group known as the Ultra Recon Squad. The URS's members claimed that Poipole were quite common in their home world, particularly in a settlement known as Ultra Megalopolis. In fact, they reported that Poipole in Ultra Megalopolis were often partnered with fledgling trainers, much as starter Pokémon are in our world; they appear to take well to human companionship and can easily understand human speech after some exposure. Poipole store an incredibly sticky, luminescent poison in their heads and can sprew it from their three protruding needles to attack; they seem to giggle happily when doing so. The corrosive poison cannot be washed off with water, making it very dangerous. According to the URS, Poipole and their evolutions dwell in enormous, hive-like structures on their home world.","Known as UB Stinger, Naganadel were first reported to the International Police by an organization known as the Ultra Recon Squad, or the URS. Said to dwell in hive-like structures on their home world, these creatures appear to be fiercely protective of their pre-evolutions, Naganadel can shoot glowing, corrosive poison from their primary stinger up to a distance of six miles (9.7 kilometers) away. This poison is also incredibly sticky, serving to both trap and incapacitate victims. According to URS research, Naganadel's brain is in fact housed in its abdomen, and its three stingers are directly connected to the organ; their research proposes that the stingers may also serve as sensory organs of sorts. Directly touching these stingers, however, causes the creatures to react violently. Naganadel are believed to be able to share thoughts and images telepathically with other sentient beings, though this has not yet been confirmed by non-URS researchers.","Though these odd creatures may at first appear to be a single organism, Stakataka--or UB Assembly, as they are codenamed--in fact consist of 150 individual units. These lifeforms appear to have an instinctive tendency to group up in the form of a wall-like structure, lumbering on four spindly legs. Their solid bodies allow them to weather all kinds of powerful attacks. These units work in tandem to travel and attack. Their eyes will turn red when angered, with all of them turning to focus on the threat at hand. Stakataka seem to detest having anything on top of them, including unfortunate bird Pokémon that mistake them for regular walls. However, according to one daring Aether Foundation researcher, these creatures will appear to develop a grudging respect (or tolerance) for those that manage to hang on for long periods of time, allowing them to ride on top of them without hassle.","Codenamed UB Burst, Blacephalon's most unusual feature is their nonsensical heads. These structures are in fact not even solid, instead consisting of a collection of red and blue sparks. Their heads are not attached to their bodies and contain an enormous amount of potential energy. According to firsthand research, Blacephalon will stagger confusingly towards enemies to approach them before suddenly, and violently, exploding their heads. Blacephalon will drain their damaged or unconscious victims of their energy. Finally, they will regenerate their energy-based heads from the holes on their \"necks.\" The shape of their sparks appears to change based on their mood and emotions. It is not yet known how Blacephalon are able to navigate their surroundings without any obvious sensory organs. Because of their erratic behavior The International Police considers Blacephalon to be one of the most dangerous Ultra Beasts, behind only Guzzlord.","Zeraora is said to roam the islands of Alola, traveling as fast as lightning. According to popular legend, Zeraora actually cannot generate electricity on its own, but instead gathers it from the air around itself. It is said to use the electricity in its paws to create powerful magnetic fields. Some inhabitants have reported seeing it zipping above the ground in open plains, levitating using this generated magnetism. Zeraora is commonly depicted with its fur standing on end from the sheer amount of electricity that is holds. It is said to be a powerful fighter, using its powerful claws to tear enemies apart. By electrifying its paws, it can even hurt opponents that manage to dodge their swings by shocking them with radiating sparks. Alolan elders claim that Zeraora is distrustful of humans because of how it was treated by a group of island newcomers; the visitors in fact came to Alola as poachers and betrayed Zeraora's trust, leading it to shun humans from then onwards. When a person sees signs of a thunderstorm but one never comes, it is said that Zeraora is responsible; its running is said to bring both thunder and lighting along with it without any rain.","Meltan are mysterious Pokémon that have only been recently re-discovered. Long described in mythical texts, Meltan are thought to split from the ancient Melmetal; it is said that the people who worshipped Melmetal protected it from calamity by keeping its composite Meltan safe in a mysterious box, to be opened again in the future once the danger had passed. Meltan are intensely curious creatures, examining anything novel that they come across. They are especially attracted to metal; their liquid metal bodies can dissolve foreign metals from soil and other sources and incorporate it into themselves. They can circulate this metal within their bodies to generate electric attacks, which they fire from their singular eye. The hexagonal \"nuts\" that surrounds these eyes are in fact detachable, though Meltan will quickly become distressed without them. Meltan are social Pokémon that prefer to dwell in groups. By spinning their nuts quickly, they can generate a whining sound that attracts other Meltan. Researchers believe that once enough Meltan congregate in one area, they can become one by reforming themselves into Melmetal. The strongest Meltan is believed to form the \"base\" of this evolution.","Melmetal was worshipped by an ancient people 3,000 years ago for its purported ability to conjure metal from thin air. Some anthropologists argue that Melmetal pre-dated the Iron Age, its technology being lost along with its worshippers during a great calamity. Others suggest that a rediscovery of Melmetal in later eons heralded the currently agreed-upon beginning of the era. During its time, its followers claimed in writing that Melmetal granted them the edge in combat and agriculture through the ability to craft stronger tools Melmetal is depicted as inhabiting a sacred forest grove with magnetite-rich soil, secluded from the outside world. Its body is said to be harder than steel, like as flexible as molten metal. According to carvings, Melmetal appears to be able to spin the \"nut\" in its chest to power its arms in a gyrating attack. Instead of dying, Melmetal is thought to rust and fall apart into many Meltan. Indeed, it is said that its worshippers protected these small Meltan in a mysterious box in order to keep them safe from a great disaster. Anthropologists believe that this calamity falls in line with a similar one described in many other parts of the world around this time, lending some support to the veracity of this belief.","Trainers entering the Gym Challenge in the Galar region may choose Grookey as their first Pokémon. Grookey are enthusiastic, curious Pokémon that enjoy exploring their surroundings. They can be a bit mischievous at times, but they always mean well. After Grookey are born, they grab a stick from a nearby tree and carry it with them for the rest of their lives. These sticks become infused with Grookey's energy by being around them; when Grookey beat their sticks on the ground, nearby plants that have wilted will begin to revitalize. In the wild, Grookey live in troops with others of their kind. Their green fur contains chlorophyll and synthesizes sunlight into energy. Grookey troops can be heard from afar drumming in time on hard Berries. In combat, Grookey will strike foes with their sticks in a rhythmic pattern, growing in strength as they stay on the beat. Trainers that do not take life seriously and enjoy dancing to their own rhythm will appreciate Grookey as their first Pokémon.​","Thwackey troops are loud and rambunctious, filling tropical rainforests with the percussive sounds of their stick-beating. They are even more adventurous than their pre-evolutions, though they maintain their easy-going dispositions when out of combat. Upon evolution from Grookey, their single sticks have become two, allowing them to create more complex rhythms. They keep this sticks tied in their heads when not in use. Thwackey love fast beats, and those that can drum up quicker tempos while still staying in time will win respect from other members of the troops. Thwackey will collect Berries and other objects of varying densities that make sounds of different timbres when hit to improve the range of their drumming. They are constantly practicing their rhythm by keeping time out of combat, walking and eating to the beat. In battle, their personalities shift and become more focused. Thwackey will get so engrossed in the rhythm of combat that they will sometimes fail to notice that they have already knocked out their foes. Thwackey troops share close bonds with one another and are inseparable. Grookey in a troop will often evolve in close succession, and Thwackey will similarly evolve together when the time comes.","Rambunctious Thwackey evolve into the calm, yet formidable Rillaboom. Thanks to their energy, their two sticks have morphed to include a stump drum. They will imbue these stumps with their energy, allowing them to control the growth of plants by beating on them. Rillaboom can also control the roots of their stumps in combat and use them to throw does. In a troop, the Rillaboom who has displayed the best drumming technique becomes the leader. These Pokémon value group harmony and cooperation, working together to beat out exhilarating performances in jungle clearings. Though they dislike pointless quarreling, they will fiercely defend allies in peril. Other Pokémon will congregate around performing Rillaboom to watch them drum and dance along. In Galarian folklore, is said that as long as these Pokémon are drumming, the rules of nature are temporarily suspended, and predator and prey will dance together as companions. Trainers who prefer cooperation over competition and do not take life too seriously will find Rillaboom excellent companion Pokémon.","Galarian trainers may decide upon Scorbunny as their starter Pokémon of choice. Scorbunny are energetic Pokémon that can rarely stay still for long. They can usually be seen hopping from one foot to the other, if not racing back and forth around the area. These Pokémon have pads on the soles of their feet that radiate heat, scorching the ground beneath them as they run; a similar pad also exists on their noses. They take time to heat up, however, as the contents of Scorbunny's flame sacs are viscous and need to soften before use. For this reason, Scorbunny need to warm up before battles by running laps. This increases their heart rate and body temperatures, helping them reach their full potentials. These flame sacs are sometimes called their \"second hearts\" due to their importance. In combat, Scorbunny run circles around their opponents to bewilder them before delivering burning kicks. Trainers that can keep up with these fast-paced Pokémon will find themselves rewarded with their impressive speed and strength.","Raboot are agile Pokémon that can sometimes be seen racing across the grasslands of Galar. They can leap high up in the air to kick Berries off of tree branches. Then, they will practice their footwork by juggling the Berries with their feet without letting them touch the ground. Raboot have thick fur that help keep them warm during Galar's cold winter months. It also keeps their flame sacs insulated so that once they are warmed up, they can stay heated for longer periods of time than as Scorbunny. Compared to Scorbunny, Raboot are less hyper, instead channeling their boundless energy into practice. These Pokémon are never satisfied with the quality of their kicks and can always find ways to improve. Raboot keep their hands tucked in and avoid using them in battle; this also helps them stay insulated. In combat, they will kick flaming stones towards opponents to scorch them, trying to score hits from unexpected angles in order to keep their foes on guard. The heated pads on their feet and the bands on the heads let them deliver both scorching kicks and headbutts. Raboot that develop new techniques for kicking will closely guard their secrets from other Raboot in order to maintain an edge in battle.","When Raboot evolve, they regain some of the energy they had as Scorbunny while maintaining the drive to succeed in battle they had as Raboot. Cinderace are famed for their incredible skill on the field. They can use their great agility and wide arsenal of kicking techniques to launch burning stones at opponents from all sorts of angles. They have strong cores and legs, allowing them to launch powerful blows with their feet. Cinderace will juggle pebbles between their feet to heat them up and feign attacks to keep their foes guessing. They are skilled at both offense and defense and love the cheering of a crowd. However, they have a tendency to show off their skills in front of an audience, sometimes at the expense of the battle itself. Still, Cinderace are have an intensely competitive spirit and will not give up a fight no matter what. Win or lose, they are good sports that can recognize a stronger foe and learn from their mistakes in battle. Trainers that are determined to always strive towards the horizon will find Cinderace to be great partner Pokémon on their journeys.","Prior to entering the Gym Challenge, starting Galarian trainers may pick Sobble as their first Pokémon. These Pokémon are quite timid, and it may take some time for them to warm up to their trainers. They are easily scared to tears, which in fact serves as their primary defense mechanism. Their tears contain a powerful eye irritant said to be as potent as 100 cut onions, making those around them tear up as well. By weeping, Sobble can force nearby threats to cry as well through the vapors emanating from their tears, momentarily blinding them and giving Sobble a chance to escape. Sobble can also alter their body patterns when in contact with water to appear almost invisible. They can \"sweat\" water from their skin in tight situations in order to seemingly disappear into thin air--though not before letting loose a quick Water-type attack when their opponents least expect it. Trainers that do not mind a challenge will be able to handle raising these timid yet clever Pokémon.","Sobble outgrow their timid natures upon evolution into Drizzile. Instead, these Pokémon are generally apathetic towards life. They prefer to work smarter, not harder, and use their wit to stay ahead of enemies. Drizzile prefer hit-and-run tactics that leave foes bewildered. They use their sticky tongues to precisely lash at enemies with surprising focus and accuracy, while also taking advantage of their ability to camouflage into water to ambush enemies. These mucus-coated tongues are also used to snipe insectile prey. They tend to be antisocial and prefer to spend their time in the solitude of tree hollows and rock depressions. Drizzile will build traps around their territories in order to keep out intruders. For instance, they may fill ditches with water and then overlay them with leaves and mud to make them appear solid; enemies trying to approach will try to walk over the ditches only to fall inside. If foes do manage to avoid their tricks, Drizzile can form balloons of water by secreting moisture from their palms that they can then throw at attackers. Drizzile prefer to do as little work as possible in order to achieve the results they want, and are known to fool other Pokémon into doing tasks for them.","Inteleon are very cunning Pokémon that have plenty of tricks up their sleeves. In addition the standard arsenal of Water-type attacks, the nictitating membranes over their eyes helps them identify the weak spots of opponents. They can shoot blasts of water at Mach 3 from their fingertips and accurately hit these weak points, sniping enemies from afar. Their tails conceal a sharp blade that can slice at enemies. In tight situations, Inteleon can even unfurl the membranes on their backs and leap off of ledge to glide away from danger. Altogether, these traits make them highly versatile Pokémon that are difficult to pin down. Though Inteleon prefer to work alone, they are not as antisocial as Drizzile. They are task-oriented and do not let their personal opinions get in the way of whatever they are trying to accomplish. Still, trainers will find that these Pokémon often sport a dry sense of humor outside of battle. They possess a certain sense of justice and are loyal to trainers who have proven themselves capable. For those who are starting the Gym Challenge in Galar and want a reliable partner who can always get the job done, Inteleon are an excellent choice.","Skwovet are a perennial pest of Berry orchards around the globe. In areas where they are prolific, it is near impossible to shake a Berry tree without having to deal with an angry Skwovet. These hardy Pokémon can tolerate a wide range of climates; they are well-insulated for cold climates thanks to their warm fur and the thick fat they obtain from constantly eating. Skwovet will always have Berries stuffed in their cheeks and will become quite distressed should they ever empty. They are not picky about flavors; from sweet to sour, bitter to spicy, Skwovet will eat any and all Berries they can find growing on trees. Though they prefer ripened Berries, they will not hesitate to nibble hard, unripe ones straight from the branch. Perhaps the only solace farmers can take when it comes to these voracious eaters is that they are extremely territorial about their food. Skwovet will not share their Berries with anyone else, so farms with a Skwovet problem will likely not have to deal with any other pests.","Thankfully for farmers, Greedent are less of a pain to deal with in Berry orchards (though not by much). This is because their large size makes them slower and clumsier than Skwovet, thus rendering them easier to catch. Still, Greedent can wreak incredible havoc on Berry trees because of their compulsion to hoard uneaten Berries in their bushy tails. This means that they will take far more than they can actually eat, destroying more crops than even the most voracious Skwovet. To add salt to the wound, these slow-witted Pokémon will commonly overstuff their tails and begin to drop Berries out of them without noticing. Farmers will wake up in the morning to see their Berries rotting on the ground, picked only to be left to waste. Greedent have sharp teeth that enable them to bite into hard-shelled and unripe Berries, so that even premature crops are not safe. To keep Skwovet and Greedent away, farmers will employ Pokémon like Herdier and Boltund in hopes of scaring them off.","Despite their small stature, Rookidee are feisty Pokémon that are always ready for a fight. The size or strength of the opponents does not matter; Rookidee will spar with any foe, and will try to learn from both victories and defeats. By practicing against all sorts of opponents, these Pokémon learn to adapt their fighting styles to different situations. For instance, Rookidee will use their size and speed to their advantage against bulky opponents, nimbly hopping between their feet to attack weak spots and avoid lumbering strikes. With meeker foes, they will instead try to press the attack to keep them off-balance. They can be a bit too eager when they see supposed openings however, and will often fall for feints. This is perhaps the hardest lesson for them to learn, and trainers may notice their Rookidee making this mistake repeatedly through many battles. It is said that when Rookidee finally learn to be patient and think their opponents' strategies through, they are ready to evolve into Corvisquire.","Corvisquire are intelligent Pokémon that use their wit to obtain the upper hand in battle. Having learned from experience by sparring as Rookidee, these Pokémon understand how to approach different types of enemies to maximize their chances of success. They are less prone to attacking impulsively than as Rookidee, instead biding their time to analyze how they think foes will act next. Corvisquire are also known for using materials in the surrounding environment as tools both in and out of combat. For instance, they will drop stones on enemies from above or circle around them with vines or ropes to entangle them. They will similarly drop rocks onto hard nuts Berries to crack them open, or set simple vine traps across treetops you ensnare other bird Pokémon intruding into their territory. Corvisquire are known to have long memories, said to be comparable to Pokémon like Copperajah. They can watch a person or Pokémon operate a simple lock mechanism to open a chest of food and then replicate the motions (if physiologically able to) in order to do the same hours later.","Corviknight are famed for their combination of strength, reliability, and intellect. These formidable Pokémon rule the skies wherever they are found. Their black steel is nigh-impenetrable and instantly recognizable to both enemies and prey, warning them to steer clear. Corviknight are also intelligent creatures, capable of using tools and solving problems through intuition. These taciturn Pokémon are always keenly observing their surroundings. Corviknight  pay attention to the body language of passerby in order to determine whether they intend to cause trouble before they even pick a fight. In some regions such as Galar, they are employed as taxi Pokémon because of their directional intuition and their stamina. Because of their reputation, Corviknight are commonly used as emblems to represent intellect and power. It is said that in medieval times, a king once wore a crown and cloak of Corviknight feathers in order to symbolize his divine wisdom and strength in a momentous battle against the kingdom's enemies. An old Galarian legend states that if the Corviknight of Galar ever disappear, the region is doomed to fall into darkness.","Blipbug are quite astute Pokémon, though they unfortunately are not very strong. They shelter themselves in flower bushes to hide from the sights of predators, feeding on leaves. Their bodies are covered in hair that can detect changes in the air currents. These hairs are so sensitive that Blipbug can sense an approaching predator on the opposite side of a field. As Blipbug mature, they begin to learn how to distinguish different enemies based on how they shift the air currents. However, they are unable to make much use of their information due to their weakness; their solution to any dangerous situation is to hide and hope they do not get noticed. Though they may seem like timid creatures, though, popular legend says that Blipbug are actually quite devious Pokémon that are only held back by their small size and lack of strength. They are said to spend all of their time carefully studying enemies from afar, biding their time until evolution so they can finally take their vengeance.","Though Blipbug are already skittish Pokémon that spend most of their time in hiding, Dottler take this secrecy even further. Though they are capable of movement, they prefer to remain almost entirely immobile. They hide in bushes or under piles of leaves, storing energy for evolution. Though they do not move, these Pokémon are still very much aware of their surroundings. They use their psychic abilities to constantly monitor the area around them. When they sense something abnormal, their dots will begin to blink; this blinking will become faster as enemies approach, and more erratic when Dottler sense especially powerful enemies. If predators do manage to locate them, Dottler will release a burst of psychic energy to stun them before attempting to make their (sluggish) getaways. The longer Dottler go without food or water, the stronger their psychic abilities and thus their detection systems become. In fact, these Pokémon do not eat at all in order to maximize their psychic conditioning and thus hasten their evolutions.","When Dottler evolve, the time they had spent fasting in order to improve their abilities finally pays off. Orbeetle wield spectacularly strong psychokinetic powers as well as a superhuman intelligence. Their brains are so large that they actually make up more than half of their body weights and require a special covering to protect their distended heads. Orbeetle are constantly exuding psychic energy, which they use to monitor their surroundings. They can sense even the tiniest movements occurring up to 6 miles (10 kilometers) away. As soon as they sense danger, they will begin formulating a plan of attack. By the time enemies actually arrive, Orbeetle will have prepared an impenetrable strategy for victory. Orbeetle are also believed to be able to influence the minds of others that are near them. It is said that these Pokémon remember those who had terrorized them as Blipbug and Dottler, and will use their immense intelligence in order to concoct ways to torment them in turn. If a person is ever faced with a problem that seems specifically designed to ruin their day, it is thought that may have unknowingly angered a Blipbug some time in the past.","Nickit are the bane of woodland campers. They are infamous for their plundering of campsites right under the noses of their owners. Nickit have soft pads on their paws that silence their steps, letting them sneak into the nests of other Pokémon (and the tents of campers) without detection. Then, after grabbing their prizes, they use their bushy tails to swipe away any footprints they have left behind. Nest owners will later return to find their food supplies missing, but no sign of any intruders. Nickit are so skilled at thievery that they rarely need to hunt at all, instead subsisting entirely on what they scavenge from other Pokémon. Nickit are cunning, but cautious Pokémon. They are rarely caught because they will bolt at the first sign of trouble, which their sensitive ears can detect from miles away. Nickit will patiently wait for hours in hiding for targets to leave their nests; even after this, they will wait a little bit longer to make sure that are not planning to return soon after.","Crafty Thievul have turned larceny into a form of art. Their silent footsteps leave no trace behind after a swipe from their trails, while their lithe bodies can slip through tight cracks to access hidden goods. Thievul still raid the food supplies of other Pokémon like Nickit, but they also have developed a taste for eggs. Skilled Thievul can even snatch eggs from right under tired mothers by waiting until they doze off for a nap. These Pokémon will stalk forests and woodlands near areas of high traffic. When they spot a Pokémon (or person) who seems like a good target, they will surreptitiously mark them with their scent and stalk them home. Thievul will then wait for the target to leave again before sneaking in to plunder their nests. Thievul despise Boltund, who are their natural enemies in the wild. Because Boltund have such strong senses of smell, they can detect targets Thievul have marked with their scents; their speed also makes them one of the few Pokémon that can catch up to agile Thievul. Though they are normally solitary, skulks of Thievul may temporarily work together to dispatch interfering Boltund with their sharp claws for this reason.","Gossifleur are wandering Pokémon that go wherever the wind blows--literally. By twisting their petals, they can control their flight paths subtly as they drift in the breeze. Gossifleur will temporarily settle down wherever they find clean water and air. In such areas, they will land en masse and anchor themselves into the soil with their single legs, forming vibrant fields. As they absorb sunlight, their flowers will begin to bloom beautifully. Finally, when Gossifleur have had their fill, they will uproot themselves and begin drifting again, singing a joyous song as they twirl away in the wind. Fields where Gossifleur rest are popular amongst locals for being filled with their beautiful colors and uplifting melodies. Their pollen has a therapeutic effect, and Gossifleur pollen tea is a popular folk remedy for the common cold, particularly when given to children. These qualities altogether make Gossifleur a popular Pokémon in rural areas near pristine, untouched wilderness. ","Eldegoss are perhaps most well-known for the cotton fluff that grows on their heads, which can be spun into a glossy and supple yarn. Eldegoss cotton is commonly used for sleepwear and high-end designer fashion; it is also combined with Wooloo wool to create a durable yet sheer fabric that is a specialty of the Galar region. The best Eldegoss cotton is believed to come from southern Galar. Eldegoss themselves rely on their cotton fluff to protect their heads from injury as they float on the wind. They also help these light Pokémon stay aloft by catching the breeze. Their seeds are packed with nutrients; as Eldegoss travel, they disperse their seeds into the land below. Many are eaten by wild Pokémon, but those that aren't enrich the soil and help future crops grow. Thus, land under Eldegoss migration routes is prized by farmers. Some regions will hold festivals in hopes of attracting migrating Gossifleur and Eldegoss to their farms, cleaning the local area too provide them with pristine air and water.","Wooloo are a common sight on farms and pastures. They are herd Pokémon that will imitate the actions of their herd leaders or trainers. Wooloo dislike conflict; if a fight breaks out, they will tuck in their legs and roll away. Indeed, farmers take advantage of this trait by employing barking Yamper and Boltund to corral their tumbling livestock into pens. Wooloo have thick, shock-absorbent wool that is said to be able to cushion them from a tumble off a cliff. This wool is also commonly used to knit warm-weather clothing and carpets because of its great strength and insulation. It is also sometimes mixed with Eldegoss cotton to create a yarn that is both glossy and durable. Northern Galar prides itself on the quality of its Wooloo wool. Wooloo grow back their wool quickly; a fully-shorn individual will regrow all of its wool in as little as three months. In fact, Wooloo must be shorn periodically, as they will grow so much wool over time that it will render them unable to move.","At first glance, Dubwool seem to sport powerful horns that would make any opponent think twice about attacking. However, these horns are purely for attracting mates and intimidating other same-gendered Dubwool; their backwards angling prevent their use in combat, and the horns themselves are actually somewhat fragile. Dubwool instead primarily rely on their thick wool to protect them. Their wool does wonders in this regard--unlike Wooloo wool, Dubwool wool is unexpectedly bouncy, deflecting physical attacks right off of itself. Fabric knitted from their wool acts much like a trampoline, and Dubwool “carpets” are popular amongst children for this very reason. Their spots also make it more difficult to shear these Pokémon without mixing the colors together and creating a mottled final product. Thus, most Dubwool on farms are likely kept around for mating purposes, as it usually more of a hassle to shear and process them than their wool ends up being worth.","Chewtle are easy to spot when they surface from the water due to their oversized heads. In fact, most of their heads are dedicated to supporting their jaw muscles, giving these Pokémon an incredible bite strength. Chewtle are always teething, which creates an uncomfortable itching in their mouths. These Pokémon are always seeking something to bite on in order to alleviate this. After Chewtle bite something, it takes some time for them to reset their mouths into a normal position and bite again. For this reason, they prefer to use their horns first in combat to charge at foes. It is only when they see their enemies flinch and give them an opening that Chewtle will chomp down with all of their might. Both their horns and their shells are rock-hard. However, their huge heads make Chewtle unable to retreat back into their shells like some other chelonian Pokémon. Instead, these Pokémon will choose fighting over hiding when it comes to danger, fearlessly biting those who try to harm them.","Drednaw are infamous for being cranky, irritable inhabitants of otherwise peaceful ponds. These Pokémon are highly territorial, chasing down intruders as soon as they notice their approach. They give no warning signs prior to attacking, either, immediately charging at potential threats. Despite their heavy, rock-hard shells, they have well-developed leg muscles that can carry them surprisingly quickly. Drednaw sport incredible jaws that can crack steel rods in two thanks to their jagged edges. To the surprise of unfortunate victims, Drednaw have extendable necks that they can launch forwards to chomp down on fleeing prey. Between their sharp horns, terrifying jaws, and unexpected agility, Drednaw can easily turn popular swimming destinations into abandoned sites merely with their presence. It takes a skilled trainer to rein in their hostile impulses, and regions where these Pokémon are abundant will hire trainers specifically to deal with Drednaw in heavily-touristed areas.","Yamper have historically been popular as herding Pokémon in agricultural communities, helping farmers corral livestock like Wooloo and Miltank. Today, they are common pets even in suburban communities. Though this history may make them seem like industrious Pokémon, do not be fooled; these Pokémon love to play far more, and only work in exchange for treats. Yamper also have short attention spans and cannot resist chasing moving things like cars. They love fetching round objects like Poké Balls. Yamper can only generate electricity as they run; their electrogenetic organs are located at the bases of their tails, charging their bodies with energy as they sprint. Yamper will begin crackling with electricity if they run for long enough, as the energy has nowhere else to go but the surrounding air. Despite their shortcomings, Yamper are still very popular for their loyal and affectionate natures; some even find their laziness and lack of ability to focus endearing.","When Yamper evolve into Boltund, they become more serious in nature and more able to focus on the tasks at hand. They still retain their playfulness outside of work, however. In some regions, human herders have partnered with Boltund in for millennia. Though their domestication process began long after Herdier, they are just as reliable with proper training and affection. Boltund generate electricity by running and store it within their legs, reinforcing both their stamina and their strength. At full charge, they can either break speeds of 50 mph (80 km/h) by sprinting or maintain a more steady pace and run for three days in a row without rest. These traits make Boltund excellent at chasing down stray livestock. In the wild, packs of Boltund can be seen zipping across grasslands. They are extremely loyal to one another and will share electricity with tired pack members to rejuvenate them. For some reason, Boltund also dislike Thievul. They will go out of their ways to track down these secretive Pokémon and stop them from stealing the eggs of other Pokémon.","Rolycoly dwell within mountains rich in coal. Their bodies are composed almost entirely of the black mineral, which also makes up their entire diets. Rolycoly burn coal to power their wheel-like feet. Their rough shape enable them to zoom across rocky terrain with ease. The heat they produce by doing so makes their eyes glow a reddish-orange, lighting up dark areas. They shed coal from their bodies as they zip from place to place. Though Rolycoly are afraid of water, they will undergo a quick burst of speed when crossing through a puddle of it as their internal engines convert it to steam. Unsurprisingly, Rolycoly were first discovered about 400 years ago just before the Galarian Industrial Revolution, when miners unearthed a massive coal deposit near Motostoke. The Pokémon quickly found their way into homes across the region, supplying coal for domestic purposes. The advent of the revolution led to a swift decline in wild Rolycoly numbers, though, just as they were first unearthed, as the coal they relied upon for survival was being rapidly consumed by human industry. This die-off continued until public outcry led to new regulations on coal mining and environmental protection. Today, historians credit this defense of Rolycoly as the first modern environmental movement. Rolycoly remain popular for outdoor activities like barbecues and camping, where small amounts of coal are necessary.","Though Carkol still love coal just as much as Rolycoly, they no longer rely solely upon it for survival. Instead, they can consume other minerals as well as organic matter (primarily plant material) in order to synthesize their own coal. They store their production on their backs as a fuel reserve, much as mammals store excess calories as fat. When Carkol produce too much coal, bits of it will simply begin falling off of their reserve piles. Galarians used to, and still do in some regions, gather this discarded coal to fuel their factories and industry. The discovery that Carkol could synthesize coal from other materials led to a significant drop in direct coal mining, alleviating numerous environmental and safety issues that accompanied the practice. Today, coal mining still supplements Carkol and Coalossal coal production, but at a much smaller scale. Carkol can combust their coal to breath flames reaching up to 1,800°F (982°C). They can also power their rolling legs in this way to race at speeds of 18 miles per hour (29 kilometers per hour).","Despite their stature, Coalossal are gentle giants. Like Carkol, they are exclusively herbivores and lithovores, consuming plant matter and minerals and compressing it within their bodies into hard anthracite. They serve as protectors of coal-rich mines and caverns, as well as of the Rolycoly and Carkol that dwell within. They will become enraged at those who threaten these coal deposits, defending them with flames reaching 2,700°F (1482°C). When Coalossal are fighting, their mountains of coal will glow bright red and radiate an immense heat. Sparks flying from their piles can ignite fires in more flammable areas. The anthracite that Coalossal produce is valued for its high quality and ease of harvest. However, because Coalossal must eat more in order to produce this high-grade mineral, it is generally not as cost-efficient as harvesting the coal that Carkol produces. Coalossal anthracite still has its uses in applications where high quality is necessary, though.","Applin hatch in the branches of apple trees. The first thing they do after emerging from their eggs is bury into the nearest apple in sight. They will remain in these fruit for the rest of their lives. Despite being Dragon-types, Applin are very vulnerable to predation, as they are ill-equipped to defend themselves. Avian Pokémon see exposed Applin as easy and delicious meals. As such, these Pokémon will patiently wait for evolution by hiding in their fruit. Once an Applin buries into an apple, it will leave only its eyes exposed, which have evolved to mimic leaves. As it grows, its tail will also pop out of the other end. Conveniently, Applin obtain all the nutrients they need until evolution from their apples. The type of apple that these Pokémon choose will determine how they evolve; Applin that bury into tart apples will become Flapple, while those that instead choose sweet apples will become Appletun. Some believe that an Applin's personality is also dictated by the exact apple varietal it chooses at birth.","Applin that bury into tart apples after hatching will one day evolve into Flapple. Flapple can concentrate the natural acids present in their fruit to concoct a potent chemical mixture. They store this acidic cocktail in their cheeks, spitting it out to catch prey or to defend themselves from attackers; it is strong enough to cause chemical burns on exposed skin. Flapple will hide in the branches of apple trees with their wings folded and their heads down to mimic apples. When unsuspecting bugs fly by, they will dissolve them with their acid before consuming their catches. Applin have in fact fashioned the skins of their apples into their wing membranes. Though resourceful, they are not particularly aerodynamic and must exert a lot of energy to stay aloft. For this reason, they prefer an ambush strategy when hunting and only fly when they need to relocate in search of better hunting grounds or escape from danger. In some regions, people dilute Flapple acid with water and add spices to create a refreshingly-tart beverage. This beverage can also be fermented to produce an alcoholic variant.","Applin that bury into sweet apples eventually evolve into Appletun. These rotund creatures are quite mild-mannered, spending much of their time lazing about in branches or at the base of trees. Their bodies are coated in a sweet, aromatic nectar that is irresistible to insects, attracting their food right to them. This nectar, as well as the skin on their backs, is also popular amongst children as an afternoon snack. An Appletun's \"ears\" are in fact functional eyes, though they remain drooped and obscured much of the time for unknown reasons. Meanwhile, their \"helmets\" are what remain of their original apples. At a first glance, resting Appletun may seem like sitting ducks when it comes to predators. The very insects they attract to prey on, however, will actually defend Appletun and their delicious nectar fiercely. In some areas, Appletun nectar is harvested and used to bake a variety of different pastries. These sweet treats are especially popular in the autumn.","Silicobra dwell in sandy, arid deserts. They are reticent creatures that dislike confrontation, instead preferring to hide themselves within the dunes. If threatened, Silicobra will spew bursts of sand from their nostrils to blind opponents before burrowing to safety. As they dig, they will swallow sand and store it in their neck pouches to replenish their shot sand. They can hold up to 17 pounds (7.7 kg) of the substance in these pouches. As ectotherms, Silicobra rely on the outside environment to regulate their body temperatures. Scientists believe that storing warm sand in their neck pouches helps them stay warm during frigid desert nights. Silicobra are ambush predators that bewilder prey with blasts of sand before striking. They are not very fast, however; prey that manage to flee from these sand blasts can usually make it to safety before Silicobra can catch up. Silicobra with full neck pouches are weighed down even further, ensuring that they will not be able to chase down their quarry. Contrary to popular belief, neither Silicobra nor their evolutions are venomous.","Sandaconda have evolved an improved mechanism of sand-spitting compared to Silicobra. By coiling their bodies into tight spirals, they can contract and then release themselves like springs to blast sand with great force. Their larger neck sacs can now hold up to 220 pounds (100 kg) of sand. The resilient sacs can act like shock absorbers and are tough enough to resist the bite of a Durant's jaws. By expelling all of this sand at once, Sandaconda can whip up huge sandstorms. They use this technique both to hunt  as well as escape from confused predators. Sandaconda are not venomous and instead prefer to construct prey until they suffocate with their powerful bodies. Though a bit arrogant when full of sand, tese Pokémon become quite restless when low on it, as they are nearly defenseless when their neck sacs are empty. Sandaconda mix sharp gravel with their sand to so that they can cut enemies even upon contact with it. Small stones that Sandaconda swallow while burrowing through dunes can become lodged in their nostrils, however, preventing them from spitting sand properly. Wild Sandaconda sometimes develop mutualistic relationships with Dwebble to take care of this; the Dwebble will dislodge the stones from their nostrils while searching for new shells, while the Sandaconda will refrain from eating their arthropod allies.","Cramorant nest on seaside bluffs in large, raucous colonies. They glide high above the waves in search of fish. When they sense movement beneath, they will dive beak-first to snap up their catches. Their favored prey is Arrokuda, but they are not picky; Cramorant have been known to catch seaweed, trash, or even non-aquatic swimming Pokémon by mistake. Cramorant are greedy eaters that will often try to swallow prey while, leading to them getting their catches stuck in their throats. Their wide airways prevent them from choking, however, so these obstructions do not bother them much. Cramorant can in fact forcefully dislodge stuck prey to attack; more graphically, they can also regurgitate the partially-digested contents of their stomachs. In fact, this is how they feed their young. Getting startled will also make Cramorant spit out their food. Cramorant can be surprisingly strong in battle, but they are not the brightest; they have been known to forgot who or why they are even fighting mid-battle, especially when they are hungry. They will never forget their trainers, however--or the face of someone that tries to steal their food. These Pokémon secrete an oil that coats their feathers and keeps them from getting waterlogged when diving.","Arrokuda are a hardy species that can tolerate both fresh and salt water. Though they seem to prefer the sea, sizable populations can be found in fast-moving rivers and large lakes as well. Arrokuda are notable for their odd hunting strategy; rather than biting prey with their teeth, they instead prefer to skewer them with their closed jaws. Arrokuda will lie in wait until they sense movement before rushing towards the first sign of prey, hoping to impale them on their sharp jaws. Arrokuda are very proud of the sharpness of these structures and will show them off to other Arrokuda to assert dominance. These Pokémon are not the brightest and commonly cause issues for boats when they accidentally pierce holes into their hulls and get stuck. Boats sailing through Arrokuda territory will often have steel-coated hulls for this reason. Anglers will wave wooden planks through the water to entice Arrokuda to skewer themselves onto them, making them easy catches. After Arrokuda eat their fill, their movements slow considerably, and they are content drifting along with the currents. This makes satiated Arrokuda a prime target for hungry Cramorant scanning the water from above.","Barraskewda are the bane of fishermen everywhere because of their uncanny habit of stealing hooked fish just before they are reeled in. These hunters are attracted to movement—such as that of a struggling fish—and can swiftly swim in to impale catches right off of their hooks. Barraskewda can spin their propeller-like tails to reach speeds of up to 100 knots. Their jaws are as sharp as spears, letting them pierce cleanly through prey with ease. Unlike Arrokuda, these Pokémon rarely get themselves stuck thanks to their improved strength, which lets them extract themselves from hard surfaces, They also seem to be better at distinguishing moving animate and inanimate objects than Arrokuda. Though they are solitary hunters, multiple Barraskewda attracted to the same large quarry (for instance, a Wailord) can independently skewer the victim to bring it down; they may fight over who gets to claim the carcass afterwards, however. As a silver lining for fishermen who have their catches stolen, Barraskewda themselves are known for having quite tasty, lean flesh that is firm enough to be cut into steaks. It is known to be quite high in mercury, however, and thus is not recommended for young children or pregnant women.","At a first glance, it would appear that these baby Pokémon are prime targets for opportunistic predators. Neither skilled at camouflage nor offense, Toxel seem like sitting ducks out in the open grasslands and badlands that they call home. However, most Pokémon know to avoid attacking these creatures. Toxel in fact secrete poison from specialized sacs in their bodies through their skin. Even grazing them will lead to numbness, while more serious exposure can lead to paralysis. Furthermore, Toxel can manipulate their toxin to perform a chemical reaction and create electricity. Though the voltage is not particularly high, it is enough to create an uncomfortable tingling; in combination with their toxin, most predators learn to stay away from all Toxel after a single unpleasant experience. As they are neither very fast nor strong, Toxel primarily eat unfortunate insects that stray too close and become immobilized by their poison or electricity. These quadrupedal Pokémon have a charming habit of sitting upright like human infants. They will attempt to toddle around on two legs until they fall over. Even at this young age, Toxel display very apparent differences in personality between individuals. Some Toxel tend to be brash and impulsive, while others are more reserved and cautious. These personality differences appear dictate what form of Toxtricity they will eventually evolve into.","There are two main forms of Toxtricity that display starkly different personalities: Amped Form Toxtricity are short-tempered and quick to act, while Low Key Form Toxtricity are calmer and more reserved in demeanor. Both species can wield powerful poison as well as electricity in combat, and few Pokémon dare confront them in the wild because of this. Toxtricity can generate electricity by \"strumming\" at their chests; in fact, by clawing at the protrusions on their torsos, they can generate energy through the friction. This action also sounds very similar to the strumming of a bass guitar, making Toxtricity habitats sound somewhat similar to the practice room of a rock band. Unsurprisingly, they are a favorite Pokémon of counterculture music groups. Toxtricity can generate more than 15,000 volts by strumming in this manner. Amped Form Toxtricity have a reputation for being competitive with other species, while Low Key Form Toxtricity are said to be haughty and disapproving of those who try to challenge them. Toxtricity will seek out stagnant, putrid water and drink it in order to concentrate its toxins. Because of this, individuals in different areas each have their own cocktails of poison.","Sizzlipede are generalist predators that will hunt anything they can get their claws into. They absorb flammable gases produced by decaying plant matter on the ground and store it within their bodies. They can then ignite this gas to make heat, concentrating it in the yellow rings on their bellies. After Sizzlipede catch prey, they will coil themselves around their meals to simultaneously subdue and cook them. This allows them to go after tougher prey than one would expect for their size. Sizzlipede are voracious eaters that will consume every bit of a catch, but they can subsist off a single good meal for weeks at a time. They can be quite finicky regarding cooking temperatures and pride themselves on being able to cook meals to perfection. Because these invertebrates can generate heat, they can inhabit cold mountains that would be too chilly for other ectotherms. When Sizzlipede run out of gas, they will retreat beneath plant detritus until they finish recharging.","Between their blazing flames and sharp fangs, Centiskorch are formidable hunters. They can ignite internal gases to reach temperatures of up to 1,500°F (816°C), enough to roast foes to a crisp. They create these gases by fermenting their food within their bellies. Meanwhile, their fangs can tear through shells and exoskeletons with ease. Centiskorch are rightfully feared by mountain climbers for their extremely hostile temperaments. When they sense intruders, they will launch their entire bodies like whips at enemies and then attempt to coil around their foes to burn them alive. Their flattened bodies help them chase enemies into rocky crevices and nimbly avoid strikes, while their tails act as decoy heads to bait out counterattacks. The only thing these Pokémon truly fear is water, which they will always give a wide berth. If Centiskorch get wet, they must burn up much of their gas to dry themselves up again, leaving them temporarily unable to hunt. The ring patterns on their bellies where they concentrate their heat are a particular weak spot in this regard.","Clobbopus spend most of their time on the sea floor wandering about. They are curious creatures who will approach new things without fear. To investigate foreign objects, they will punch them with their tentacles; by doing so, they can test the objects' strength, durability, texture, and many other characteristics. This allows them to adopt new punching techniques for dealing with different situations. Clobbopus will \"study\" inanimate and animate things indiscriminately, and it is common to see them accidentally pick fights with ornery Binacle or Cloyster by punching them. Clobbopus can regrow their tentacles quickly, though, so even nasty injuries rarely hold them back for long. Clobbopus are amphibious and will venture onto land to hunt and explore. Even young Clobbopus are thought to be as intelligent as human three year-olds--and as bratty as well in some situations. They will throw tantrums if unable to punch what they want to, even if their trainers know doing so will cause them injury. Still, they have long memories and will remember not to hit things that have hurt them in the past.","Clobbopus that have punched many different things and learned how to deal with them appropriately will eventually become confident enough to intentionally pick fights with others; it is at this time that they will evolve into Grapploct. Grapploct have bodies of almost pure muscle, lending bot their punches and grappling moves great strength. They train rigorously on the sea floor by smashing blocks of stone and ice. Then, they will venture onto land in search of worthy foes. Once a Grapploct sights a potential challenger, it will taunt the opponent from afar to get them to come closer. Once they draw near, the duel begins. Regardless of the battle's outcome, Grapploct will return to the sea after fighting to recuperate. Golisopod are a favorite opponent (and sometimes meal) for Grapploct. These Pokémon frown upon the use of weapons in combat and will in fact turn down challengers that wield them unless the weapons are thrown aside. Grapploct become quite restless if unable to fight for extended periods of time, and may even try to pick fights with Pokémon underwater if they cannot find any opponents on land; this usually does not go well for them, as Grapploct train primarily for terrestrial duels.","Sinistea are said to be born when lonely spirits possess cold, unfinished cups of tea. They spend much of their time lying in wait for unsuspecting passerby to try to take a sip of them, as they can only drain life force from within another being. However, because they taste absolutely terrible, they only have a fleeting moment to do so. Once Sinistea manage to gather enough energy, they will roam in search of a teapot to possess, leading to their evolutions. Though Sinistea seem to prefer fine china as their vessels of choice, they are not very good at detecting forgeries. Thus, most Sinistea in existence actually inhabit forged teacups; authentic Sinistea will bear a stamp on their bottoms. The swirl pattern on a Sinistea's body is its weak point, and stirring it within its cup will make it very dizzy. They don't seem to mind the addition of cream and sugar, however. In Galar, it is considered bad luck to leave a cup of tea unfinished, as one may be inviting a Sinistea to inhabit it. It is believed that Sinistea that possess stronger black tea will become stronger themselves as well.","When Sinistea manage to inhabit fine, antique teapots, they will evolve into Polteageist. Like Sinistea, Polteagiest can possess either forged or authentic teapots. Though they could not tell the two apart as Sinistea, they are able to now as Polteageist; this is a common source of regret amongst Polteageist, as they can now see the errors they have made in choosing their pots. Most teapots in circulation are forgeries, though, so finding authentic porcelain pots is quite a rarity. Galarians are taught as children to never leave a pot of unfinished black tea unattended, as doing so will invite a Polteageist to haunt it. To defend themselves, Polteageist will launch their tea into the mouths of attackers, immediately causing their foes to feel weak and dizzy. Strong chills are a common symptom of Polteageist tea consumption. However, Polteageist will willingly share their tea with those it trusts deeply, and tea connoisseurs relish the unique flavor, aroma, and experience that only Polteageist tea can provide. Too much can lead to an upset stomach, however, Polteageist themselves are quite picky about tea and will frown upon trainers that display unsophisticated palates when it comes to brewing it. These Pokémon are seen as pests in the hospitality industry, as they will commonly pose as ordinary pots in hotels and cafés. They also reproduce by pouring themselves into new cups, making infestations a huge issue.","Hatenna make their homes deep within secluded woodlands, preferring isolation whenever possible. This is because the protrusions on their heads can sense emotions like radars, causing the Pokémon great distress when near sources of passion. This sensory system helps them detect predators who mean them harm well before they draw near. Hatenna seem especially sensitive to the feelings of people, and even more so towards hostile emotions. This has historically made them excellent warning systems for other woodland Pokémon to signal the approach of human trappers and hunters. When cornered, these Pokémon will release a burst of psychic energy to stun attackers before fleeing deeper into the wilderness. Hatenna raised by short-tempered trainers can grow up traumatized and unable to form bonds with others. Even well-meaning, but excitable trainers can cause their Hatenna unnecessary stress. For this reason, trainers seeking to raise these Pokémon must receive a psychiatrist-granted license ensuring their temperamental suitability. Hatenna, once bonded with even-tempered trainers, have a charming tendency to perch themselves of their trainers’ heads.","Like their pre-evolutions, Hattrem are highly sensitive to the emotions of surrounding beings. When faced with a surge of passionate emotion, however, they will not run away like Hatenna. Instead, Hattrem will seek out the source and pummel it violently with their braids; after all, a fainted person of Pokémon feels no strong emotions one way or the other. A psychokinetically-reinforced blow from a Hattrem’s braid is strong enough to knock out a pro-wrestler. They can be commonly seen using these braids to support them like legs. Hattrem also dislike noise and will similarly seek out loudmouths and get them to pipe down, with force if necessary. Some people joke that their moniker “the Serene Pokémon” is quite unfitting for such an irritable species. In fact, they were named this in reference to the quiet, peaceful environments that they create around themselves through such policing action. In regions where Hattrem dominate, other Pokémon live in silent fear of their retribution—though not too much fear, so as to not trigger their dislike of strong emotions. Hattrem in such regions will often be working alongside a powerful Hatterene to rule the entire woodland.","Hatterene are mysterious creatures that only dwell in the deepest parts of the most secluded woodlands. Known as \"Forest Witches,\" these Pokémon prefer peace and quiet; while not as sensitive to noise and emotions as Hattrem, they still strongly dislike loud noises and passionate feelings. Pokémon that dwell near Hatterene know to keep themselves in check, lest they find themselves being ripped into by the claw that grows out of a Hatterene's head. Hatterene constantly emit a low-level of psychic energy to induce headaches in strangers that come too close to their territory. Indeed, an unnatural quiet and a tingling sensation in the head is a good sign that a Hatterene is near. Many legends surround these Pokémon and their elusive nature. For instance, it is said that while Hatterene will usually mercilessly bewitch travelers who intrude upon their territory, they will make deals with those that they find \"tolerable.\" If a Hatterene shows a willingness to bargain, one should never renege on the deal. Hatterene will exact terrible vengeance on those that betray them.","Impidimp are pesky creatures that thrive on feelings of annoyance and frustration. They will sneak into homes and steal tiny things like keys and glasses before retreating into the shadows. There, they will wait for the occupants to notice their missing belongings before greedily sucking in their negative emotions through their nostrils. More clever individuals may create roadblocks in woodland paths or move around signposts to disorient and frustrate travelers. Groups of Impidimp can wreak havoc on rural villages by terrorizing townsfolk with tiny inconveniences. Such communities often have their own superstitions for keeping these pests at bay. One popular belief, for instance, is that Impidimp detest silver so much they cannot even approach it. Homes near woodlands where Impidimp dwell may hang silver talismans on their doorknobs to keep the Pokémon out. Scientific evidence seems to support this practice; while Impidimp are inherently weak to Steel-type attacks, they seem to especially despise pure silver.","If Impidimp revel in creating minor annoyances to feast on negative emotions, Morgrem are decidedly more serious about their means of obtaining sustenance. These Pokémon will try to lure people into the woods and make them lose their ways, allowing them to feed on feelings of frustration and despair for weeks at a time. Morgrem will alter signposts to mislead travelers or imitate the calls of children and Pokémon in need in order to trick good samaritans into entering their territories. These Pokémon are also treacherous; if caught, they will get down on all fours and pretend to beg for forgiveness. Then, when their opponents' guards are lowered, Morgrem will lash out with their spear-like hair to stab them. Some regions believe that Morgrem possess the ability to make crops grow, and treat the Pokémon with a cautious respect because of this. Still, even villagers in these areas will hang silver amulets by their doors to keep Morgrem from actually entering their homes.","Village children who live near Grimmsnarl territory grow up hearing tales of their fearsome strength and cunning. Though rarely sighted by humans, Grimmsnarl are said to make their homes deep within dark woodlands, venturing out in the dead of night to visit unlucky homes. They are thought to seek out the houses of those who are discontent with their lots in life and feast upon their despair and frustration. Though Grimmsnarl return to their woodlands before sunrise, they are said to lash out viciously at those who sight them while feeding. Thus, children should not sneak out of the house late at night, unless they wish to risk attracting the ire of a feeding Grimmsnarl. Grimmsnarl can manipulate their hair to wrap around their foes much like tentacles. They also can function like pseudo-muscle fibers, wrapping around their arms and legs to strengthen their blows. With full reinforcement in this manner, Grimmsnarl can even overwhelm the likes of Machamp with sheer force. It is said that after a Grimmsnarl visits a home, it will leave behind a telltale scattering of black hair. This is a sign for the home's inhabitant to make a change in their life to stop the Grimmsnarl from coming again.","In the unforgiving terrain of the Galarian wilds, intense competition between Galarian Linoone is common. Individuals who have survived many conflicts may one day evolve into Obstagoon. Obstagoon are resilient creatures that will do whatever it takes to survive. Their thick fur helps them stay warm during chilly Galarian nights. They never make the first move in combat. Instead, Obstagoon will cross their arms and let out deafening shouts to taunt opponents into attacking first. These yells are loud enough to make foes stagger, clouding their judgement and encouraging them to strike rashly. When finally attacked, Obstagoon will expertly block the blows before throwing their foes off balance and counterattacking with their sharp claws. This provocation technique is known as the move Obstruct. Obstagoon are always looking for a fight and will try to goad passerby into attacking by taunting them with their shouts. Like Galarian Linoone, Obstagoon are a popular symbol for antiestablishment youth cultures due to their habit of causing trouble wherever they go.","The artificial selection that led to Galarian Meowth was so drastic that their evolutions are no longer even considered Persian, but rather another Pokémon entirely. Perrserker have \"helmets\" of hardened fur and iron-hard \"beards\" that protect them from attacks. Their sharp claws can join together to form vicious daggers they use to claw at foes. Perrserker are infamous for their ruthlessness; they seem to relish taking down defenseless foes in combat. In the heat of battle, Perrserker enter trance-like states where they are numb to pain, mercy, and even the orders of their trainers. These Pokémon were the trusted partners of seafaring raiders in times past, pillaging settlements near wherever ships could sail. Perrserker were so trusted by their raiding partners that the two were often buried together at sea. They are native to the frigid northern reaches that these pillagers originally hailed from, but today are common throughout regions like Galar where the raiders had plundered.","According to folklore, Galarian Corsola are so full of sorrow due to their unnatural deaths that they can channel this mournful energy, alongside the energy they absorbed from others, into evolution and become Cursola. This energy overwhelms their bodies and cracks them wide open. Cursola are mere husks of their former selves, instead relying on ectoplasm to protect themselves from harm. They can often be found congregated as ghostly \"reefs\" in areas that once were full of tropical oceanic life, bobbing up and down. This includes both areas that were underwater in prehistoric times as well as places that have lost their Corsola due to climate change and pollution. At night, Cursola reefs can be heard crying plaintively in unison; it is said that they are mourning the losses of their old habitats. On nights of the full moon, reefs will beam shining lights of energy towards the sky. Whether this is to release excess energy or to communicate with other Cursola is unkonwn, but it is a beautiful sight nonetheless. Cursola are said to curse anyone who touches their ectoplasm, turning them as stiff as stone. In the decades following the Galarian Industrial Revolution, beaches around the region became filled with crying Cursola, making them unsafe for swimmers. Historians believe that these Cursola outbreaks played a significant role in convincing the public that environmental regulations were necessary to rein in factory pollution.","Only Farfetch'd that have survived many battle and defeated opponents much stronger than themselves can evolve into Sirfetch'd. Sirfetch'd are famous for being noble and chivalrous, being a symbol for knighthood in regions like Kalos and Galar. One of the most famous medieval Galarian paintings depicts a Sirfetch'd and an Escavalier in the midst of a duel. Sirfetch'd will strive to engage only in fair battles; they even may discard one or both of their weapons when facing a weak opponents in order to level the playing field. Sirfetch'd have broken off the tops of their leafy leeks to use as a shield while wielding the pointed ends of their stalks as lances. These two halves of a whole are their most prized possessions in the world, and Sirfetch'd care for them religiously. When their weapons finally wilt, Sirfetch'd will retire from combat rather than find new leeks. During famines, Sirfetch'd were said to share their leeks and shield with starving peasants to nourish them, even knowing that doing so would mean they would never be able to fight again. The story of a gallant, undefeated Sirfetch'd who let a starving family eat his lance and shield is a parable still told in Galarian fairytale books to this day.","Galarian Mr. Mime that are particularly skilled in the art of tap-dancing may one day evolve into Mr. Rime. These Pokémon are famous across Galar for their incredible talent. When a popular Mr. Rime visits a city, visitors from nearby towns will flock to see it perform. Some Mr. Rime are so popular that tourists from around the globe will visit Galar just to see them dance. Both children and adults alike are entertained by their nimble footwork and amusing dancing. Mr. Rime wave their icy canes in time with their steps, and their audiences feel compelled to clap along to the beat as well. The patterns on their bellies exude psychic energy that smoothens their movements and lightens their footsteps; they in fact also act second sets of eyes to help Mr. Rime stay alert to how the audience is feeling. Mr. Rime can wave their canes to freeze moisture in the air around them, creating sparkling flurries that enrapture onlookers. The horns on their heads act like feelers that sense the audience's anticipation, letting Mr. Rime know how to best thrill them with their next moves.","The rune fragments of Galarian Yamask are constantly draining away at the spirits. At certain particular spots in Galar, the runes are imbued with stronger energy; if an already-weakened Yamask is unfortunate enough to be atop one of these spots, the runes will have enough energy to absorb the spirit entirely. The Pokémon that emerge from this occurrence are known as Runerigus. These creatures are the realized form of an ancient curse painted into a runestone. By absorbing vengeful spirits, they have come to life and gained corporeal form. It is not known why Runerigus were painted, but some anthropologists speculate they may have been protective symbols against roaming spirits. Ancient druids may have erected spirit-absorbing runes around their villages to keep wandering souls at bay. According to myth, the painting depicted on a Runerigus shows a stylized image of the soul it contains. It is said that if one touches a Runerigus, one will be shown all of the horrific memories its soul had suffered throughout both its life and its afterlife.","Milcery have bodies made entirely of what appears to be cream. They are said to be born when sweet-smelling particles in the air coalesce into a Pokémon. Thus, they can often be found in patisseries and ice cream parlors in cities, or in fields of fragrant flowers in the wild. Milcery love sweets and cream. They rarely eat enough to make a dent in kitchen supplies, however, and it is a superstition amongst bakers that a visiting Milcery will bring the patisserie success and fortune. If their pastries smell good enough to attract Milcery, after all, then they are surely good enough for customers. As Milcery move, they agitate their bodies and incorporate surrounding air. Eventually, when they have gained enough volume in this manner, they will evolve. Milcery cream becomes infused with what the Pokémon have recently eaten or been around. When their aroma begins fragrant enough for trainers to smell it from afar, Milcery are approaching evolution.","When Milcery agitate the cream in their bodies enough and incorporate enough air, their body compositions will shift and they will evolve into Alcremie. Alcremie display all sorts of flavor variations based on what they had eaten as Milcery. Pleasant vanilla, tart berry, earthy matcha, refreshing mint, sour lemon, salty cream, two-toned swirl, bitter caramel, and multicolor rainbow are all examples of flavors Alcremie can have infused in their cream. These Pokémon also adorn themselves with different Sweets, further compounding their variation. Alcremie can secrete their flavored whipped cream and will give it to trainers that they trust, often placing them on complementary Berries. The cream is sweeter and richer when Alcremie are happy. Naturally, this makes them a valuable partner for pastry chefs, who incorporate their cream in all sorts of desserts. In the wild, Alcremie use their fragrant cream to defend themselves, throwing it at the faces of attackers. This either blinds them or forces them to ingest some; the cream and its fragrance has a strong soothing effect that can satiate chasing predators.","Falinks are always found in groups of six, no more and no less. They can be spotted marching through rugged badlands in single file, their feet stepping in time. The individual in the front of a Falinks is slightly larger than the others and is known as the brass; the remaining units are called troopers. Brasses lead Falinks in all aspects of life, ordering them through numerous precise formations suited for different tasks. Falinks will adapt different formations for hunting, defending, scouting, and even resting. The units in each position will hold their shields in different orientations in order to maximize the area protection. Though Falinks are nigh-impenetrable when in defensive formations, they are at their weakest when changing places; for this reason, Falinks practice changing formations on a daily basis in order to ensure their transitions are as swift as possible. Falinks are valiant fighters that will not back down if their brasses order them to, no matter the odds. It is said that in ancient times, a single Falinks held back an entire army by funneling them through a narrow mountain pass and maintaining an impeccable formation.","Pincurchin are simple Pokémon that are content spending their entire lives in a single tide pool or spot on the sea floor. They slowly shuffle from place to place in search of seaweed, scraping it off of rocks using their teeth. These Pokémon are well known for their electrified spines, which are a perennial nuisance for ocean swimmers. When a Pincurchin spine pierces the skin, it releases a steady flow of current that electrifies the victim. Thanks to their stored energy, Pincurchin spines continue to discharge electricity for at least three hours even after breaking off the Pokémon. As this usually occurs in the ocean, the breaking of a Pincurchin spine also releases a shock of electricity into the surrounding water. The initial pain caused by their injuries settles into numbness as the electricity continues to flow, with a persistent tingling sensation accompanying the return of feeling in the area. These electrified spines are sufficient to deter oceanic predators, who after all are primarily Water-types.","Snom are thought to be one of the most \"charismatic\" Bug-types; even those with mild entomophobia may make an exception for these small creatures. Snom live in snowy areas, most commonly found buried in snow piles at the bases of trees. They are weak Pokémon that try to blend into icy terrain in order to avoid predation. Snom feed entirely on snow, using it to create the icicles that grow on their backs. These growths also help Snom mimic icicles when they hang themselves from tree branches to rest. The more snow a Snom eats, the larger these spikes grow. Snom adhere themselves to branches using a special, frigid silk that radiates cold air. They can also spit this substance onto attackers to both tangle them up and slow their movements. Scientists are researching this silk for potential usage in arctic exploration equipment. When Snom eat a significant amount of snow, their spikes will grow so large that they will have a hard time moving. This is a sign that they are ready to evolve.","Frosmoth are elusive creatures that only inhabit the snowiest forests mountain peaks. As they fly, they scatter icy particles from their wings that freeze moisture in the air to create snow. Their wings can reach temperatures below -290°F (-180°C). Frosmoth are said to protectors of snowy areas, descending upon those who defile the environment in such places and whipping up powerful blizzards. In Galar for instance, a factory near Wyndon was frozen solid by a Frosmoth for polluting the nearby hills. Once a year, as winter ends, Frosmoth will migrate north towards arctic areas to escape the incoming heat. The land beneath them gets blanketed in a light dusting of snow thanks to their flapping wings. The reverse occurs at the start of the cold season when they return. These events herald the end and the beginning of the winter months respectively in many regions, and have developed cultural significance thanks to their beauty. Tourists from tropical areas will come in droves to witness Frosmoth migrations.","Stonjourner are mysterious Pokémon that, despite being Rock-types, are rarely found anywhere near actual sources of stone. Instead, they prefer to dwell on open grasslands and ancient ruins. Stonjourner have a peculiar habit of watching the sun for long stretches of time. All Stonjourner will at the very least observe the sun at its zenith as well as when it reaches horizon. Once a year, Stonjourner across the globe will journey to specific areas of the world and stand together, motionless, in circles. This event occurs at a specific date and time that all individuals seem to know regardless of time zones, weather, or other factors. They will remain this way until the sun sets, and then disperse as if nothing had happened. These Pokémon were thought to have great significance to the ancient peoples of Galar, as stone circles imitating this Stonjourner ritual have been found littering the region. To this day, many Galarian myths and folklore surround Stonjourner and their peculiar behavior. Though they appear immobile, Stonjourner can actually deliver very powerful kicks with their huge, stony legs; they dislike being interrupted from their sun-gazing and will retaliate this way if bothered.","The most striking features that most people first notice about Eiscue is their cube-shaped heads. These are in fact solid blocks of ice encasing their real heads, which are considerably smaller. Because ice is less dense than water, Eiscue can in fact float on ocean currents like buoys in order to travel from floe to floe with little effort. In fact, this is how scientists believed they first came to more southern regions (compared to the arctic seas), floating along vast currents alongside icebergs. Eiscue catch prey by dangling their singular hairs into the water like lures to attract fish. In fact, the hairs are directly connected to their brains by a single nerve, making them quite sensitive. These hairs also radiate cold to freeze the immediate surrounding water; they are said to radiate even colder air when Eiscue have ideas. This is how Eiscue reform their ice blocks when they are shattered by attackers. The real heads of Eiscue are quite heat-sensitive, so the ice blocks help them keep cool in more temperate regions. Though Eiscue dislike being bare-headed, the worried expression of Noice Face Eiscue (as such individuals are called) is a popular emoticon in modern media. Eiscue are carefree Pokémon that will take hardships in stride; as long as they have their ice, they are willing to face just about anything.","Indeedee are commonly employed in various positions of the service industry. These Pokémon feed on positive emotions, sending and absorbing them through their horns. As such, they find it quite convenient that humans tend to congregate in cities and experience relief and gratitude when services are performed for them. Male Indeedee excel at butlership, for instance, while female Indeedee are excellent babysitters. In the wild, Indeedee will partner with other species to take care of nests while their owners are away. Indeedee are quite intelligent and know when they are being taken advantage of, however; individuals can touch horns with one another to exchange information. This makes them highly efficient at warning others of unsavory employers and ungrateful customers. Thus, treating one Indeedee poorly can easily result in Indeedee across the city refusing to assist a person in all manners of tasks. Historically, Indeedee strikes have been an influential force in labor reform. This has become particularly prominent with the rise of the service economy in recent decades.","At a first glance, Morpeko appear to be adorable, docile rodents as they scurry about pleasant grasslands and fields. However, when their stomachs begin growling, they turn into different beasts entirely. Hangry Mode Morpeko, as they are called, are absolute menaces, terrorizing everything around them as they search for food. They are not above acts of brutal violence against those standing between them and sustenance. Once Morpeko nourish themselves, they will revert back to their Full Belly Modes--but not for long, as their high metabolisms mean that these Pokémon will get hungry quite frequently. Morpeko generate electricity by stuffing seeds into their cheek sacs; when in Hangry Mode, this power is mysteriously converted into a Dark-type energy that can sometimes be seen radiating from their cheeks. Morpeko will roast these seeds with electricity to make them easier to digest. Even in Full Belly mode, they can be very protective of their food stores. Scientists have linked their transformations with a number of hunger hormones, all of which are radically unstable in Morpeko compared to other species.","Cufant originate from the tropics, though they have been successfully brought over to more temperate regions like Galar. They prefer to spend their time near water on open savannas or jungle clearings. Where they are endemic, Cufant are famous for their spectacular load-bearing ability. They can carry up to five tons of weight without even breaking a sweat. It is for this reason that they were imported into regions across the globe, with varying rates of success. Their bodies are made of solid copper. This means that they will tarnish a vibrant green color when in contact with water. Oftentimes, a Cufant's feet will be tarnished from walking near rivers, while its trunk will be similarly tarnished from drinking in watering holes. Their heads and backs may also sport a mottled green from rainstorms. These tarnished areas are actually less affected by further weather conditions, and Cufant are ready for evolution when their entire bodies have turned green through this reaction. Cufant use their powerful trunks to dig through the earth in search of copper to eat.","Copperajah dwell in herds near sources of fresh water. Though naturally endemic to the tropics, they have been imported to other regions in past centuries and now exist elsewhere as domesticated populations. Copperajah are valued for their immense strength, helping transport heavy loads across long distances. Copperajah also have powerful trunks that can crush stone into dust, allowing them to sift through the rubble in search of copper. Herds of them can be seen working together to pulverize entire mountains rich in the metal. Their copper skin has completely tarnished, rendering it impervious to water. In some regions, Copperajah were believed to be the Pokémon of kings. These Pokémon would be dressed in royal regalia for official processions, and rulers would ride on top of them as they passed through villages on the way to the palace. These Pokémon are quite intelligent and protective of others in their herd. They are said to have long memories that will never forget a face.","Dracozolt are an anomaly of modern science. When Galarian archaeologists first unearthed fossils in the desert near Stow-on-Side, they did their best to assemble the uncovered bones into their correct configurations. Unfortunately, they had uncovered no complete skeletons, but did not know it at the time. The result was Pokémon like Dracozolt, who they had assumed had a larger posterior end than anterior end as a quirk of evolution. Based on their jaw structure, these scientists had hypothesized that Dracozolt were herbivorous, feeding on nuts and seeds. Their powerful hind legs were believed the generate electricity as they ran. Dracozolt would have gone extinct as plant-based food sources dwindled, perhaps from their own overconsumption or a cooling climate. However, the community was in for a shock when modern resurrection technology revived the Dracozolt we see today. Of the fossil chimeras, Dracozolt are perhaps the best adapted, though this is not saying much. Other than their mismatched torso sizes, they can maneuver and feed with relative stability.","When scientists first construct the skeleton of the first Arctozolt, they presumed that it was an arctic creature. They hypothesized that they dwelled near icy waters and froze prey on their cold bodies to preserve their meals. However, their incongruous tops were clearly not designed to withstand frigid temperatures, so they suggested that the constant shivering of their heads and necks helped them generate electrical energy. This imbalance also would have made it difficult for them to move their oversized bottom halves, and perhaps this sluggishness would explain how they went extinct. Revived Arctozolt clearly show that two halves of separate Pokémon were accidentally spliced together in the reassembly process, and the Pokémon indeed display all of the questionable \"adaptations\" scientists thought they would possess. Uncomfortable in both polar and temperate climates, these resurrected creatures require intense external thermoregulation to stay alive.","Looking at a modern Dracovish, it is clear that something went horribly awry at some point in the resurrection process. Most obviously, the Pokémon's two halves came from different species, and the head has been incorrectly attached to the wrong end of the tail. When first put together, paleontologists believed that these Pokémon were primarily aquatic, possessing remnants of what they (correctly) thought were gills. However, the powerful legs made them believe that Dracovish may have briefly run out of the water to ambush terrestrial prey, despite being unable to breathe air. They would have been able to reach speeds of 40 mph (64 km/h) on the sand, and their strong jaws would have helped them quickly grasp and drag victims back into the waves. However, as shoreline prey began to adapt and move higher up the waterline, Dracovish could not follow due to their gills, and thus died out after they exhausted what they could catch near the sea. Modern Dracovish can survive in fully aquatic environments, preferring not to venture on land at all if they can avoid it. Consequently, their powerful legs are of no use to them beyond slowly trudging along the bottoms of their tanks.","Of the fossil chimeras, Arctovish are perhaps the most understandable mixup. Both halves of the Pokémon are aquatic and share a broadly similar body plan. What is more glaring, however, is the fact that their heads are in fact attached entirely upside-down. The paleontologists who assembled Arctovish believed that this odd mouth placement may have had to do with the fact that these Pokémon froze the surrounding water to immobilize their prey. As ice floats, perhaps this placement allowed them to feed on cubes bobbing at the surface more easily. We now know that this is not the case, and Arctovish experience great trouble eating. Scientists had also believed that their broadened \"faces\" (actually the tops of their heads) had toughened skin to defend against attacks much like shields. Ultimately, Arctovish were believed to go extinct due to the subpar respiratory abilities granted by their odd gill placement. Indeed, resurrected Arctovish do experience breathing problems, largely due to the facts that they have half of a mammalian and half of an piscine respiratory system, connected together quite haphazardly but miraculously in a semi-functional manner.","Duraludon are most well-known for their hard, shiny bodies. They are in fact composed of a special lightweight metal alloy, allowing these large creatures to move with great agility while remaining very resilient to attacks. The alloy is also highly reflective, blinding opponents using the light of the sun. Its main drawback is that it rusts easily, meaning that Duraludon must take care to avoid water. Thus, they prefer to inhabit caves or mountains with large overhanging ridges they can hide under to stay dry from the rain. Duraludon use their two asymmetric hands to grind stone into rubble before consuming it. They must consume a variety of minerals in order to strengthen their bodies. In some regions, these Pokémon are seen as rivals of fearsome Tyranitar, battling one another for control of mountain territory. A famous Galarian movie depicts a fight between a Dynamax Tyranitar and a Dynamax (Gigantamax in the sequel) Duraludon taking place in an urban setting.","Dreepy are said to be the spirits of ancient Pokémon that used to thrive in prehistoric oceans and vast lakes. They are believed to prowl their old habitats, indicating areas that used to be submerged in water in prehistoric times. In solitude, Dreepy are quite feeble creatures that cannot defend themselves. A baby Pokémon or a human child could defeat a Dreepy in battle quite easily. These Pokémon are rarely found unprotected in the wild, however, as they are invariably accompanied by Drakloak or Dragapult. These evolutions both care for the Dreepy and use them in combat, launching them at high speeds towards enemies. The Dreepy fortunately find this to be great fun, as they are learning how to orient themselves in flight to achieve maximum speeds. As Dreepy approach evolution, they will leave their caretakers and begin searching for younger Dreepy to take up and raise after they become Drakloak. ","Though they may not appear like caretakers on the surface, Drakloak are doting adoptive parents that dedicate themselves to raising the Dreepy on their heads. Drakloak help teach their Dreepy how to fly and hunt, as well as numerous other skills necessary for survival in the wild. They can be seen playing with their Dreepy in the air by soaring at speeds of 120 mph (193 km/h) before launching the Dreepy even further forwards. This maneuver also teaches the Dreepy proper form in flight. In combat, Drakloak will launch their passengers at opponents at high speeds, teaching the Dreepy to fight at the same time. Because Dreepy approaching evolution will leave their Drakloak, these Pokémon frequently suffer from empty nest syndrome. Drakloak without Dreepy to raise become quite restless and will try to substitute other small Pokémon in their stead, raising (and firing them off their backs) as if they were Dreepy.","Dragapult are masters when it comes to both stealth and speed. Their ethereal bodies make no sound as they soar through the sky, while their unique head shape produces lift and helps them achieve high speeds. To attack, these Pokémon will launch their Dreepy out of their horns at supersonic speeds. Like Drakloak, Dragapult are very protective of their Dreepy, though they tend to be less doting and more in favor of \"tough love.\" Dragapult expect their Dreepy to practice their abilities on their own time, and may threaten to abandon them if they fail to show results. However, most Dragapult would never actually leave behind a helpless Dreepy, and such tactics seem to only serve to scare the Dreepy into working hard. When their Dreepy finally evolve, Dragapult seem to show signs of great pride in their adoptees--though it is unlikely they will express this directly to them.","Long ago, the Galar region was brought to the brink of destruction by a terrible event known as the Darkest Day. It was through the courage of brave hero wielding a sword and a shield that Galar was saved from calamity. In some parts of the region, however, elders remember a slightly different version of the legend. According to them, the hero of Galar was actually two heroes, and they were Pokémon rather than people. Zacian was the one that wielded the brilliant sword, forging it from metal particles in the air. Known as the \"Fairy King's Sword,\" it could cut down even the largest Gigantamax Pokémon with a single strike. Its graceful movements were said to appear like dancing, while its strikes were so fast that they could not be seen; those who were struck down fell with no pain. Zacian's blade was said to be able to cleave the sea in two. Some say that Zacian was Zamazenta's older sister, while others saw them instead as rivals. Regardless, according to the old version of the myth, the two heroes worked together alongside an ancient king of Galar to save the region before descending into the Slumbering Weald east of Postwick to slumber, their weapons left to rust. Today, though the heroes have largely been misremembered, Galarians still believe that something peculiar remains afoot in the Slumbering Weald.","Every modern Galarian knows the legend of the hero of Galar, who saved the land from ruin during the Darkest Day wielding only a sword and a shield. However, fewer are aware an earlier version of the story exists, one in which the singular hero in fact is two Pokémon. In this version, Zamazenta wields the stalwart shield, forged from metal particles in the air. Alongside its older sister (or rival, depending on which variant is to be believed), Zamazenta worked with an ancient Galarian King to save the region from doom. Its impenetrable shield could withstand blows from even the largest Gigantamaxed opponents, and people called it the \"Fighting Master's Shield.\" It was said to be a valiant warrior who always stood on the front lines, shielding allies from attack. By bashing its shield forward, Zamazenta could send forth shockwaves that could crack the land and knock down hundreds of foes. It was said that it could even blast through a mountain this way. After averting the calamity, Zamazenta retreated to the Slumbering Weald to rest, its shield left to rust. It is said that it slept as still as a statue for aeons, resting for so long that its legend was corrupted into the single-hero version known today. Some say that should the Darkest Day ever return, Zacian and Zamazenta must be reawakened if Galar wishes to have any hope for survival.","Little is known about the mysterious Eternatus. According to some obscure legends, it is said to have arrived on Earth on a meteorite some 20,000 years ago. It landed somewhere in the region of Galar, where it has remained ever since. Its meteorite also showered Galar with energy-infused particles, the larger clumps of which came to be known as Wishing Pieces and Wishing Stars. Power spots are areas where this energy is heavily concentrated, and it is thought that it is this energy that allows Pokémon in the region to Dynamax. Eternatus rested in secrecy for thousands of years, steadily absorbing the energy scattered across the region into the core on its chest. It is said that should Eternatus ever awaken, the immense energy it would radiate across Galar would cause Pokémon to begin Dynamaxing uncontrollably. Indeed, this is said to be what happened during the Darkest Day, and it was only with the aid of the hero (or heroes) of Galar that disaster was averted. In some stories, if Eternatus were to absorb all of the energy of Galar into itself, Pokémon would no longer be able to Dynamax, and Eternatus's core would become overloaded with energy. Eternatus would enter a terrible form that would warp the very fabric of space and time itself."]

Scientists are not quite sure why this is. In the past, it was believed that they were the “missing link” between draconians and squamatans, having evolved some characteristics of Draconidae, like wings, but not yet others, like the Dragon-type.

The traditional viewpoint is that they are closest with Carracosta, a fellow bipedal, aquatic chelonian--two traits shared only between Blastoise and Carracosta and no other Pokémon in the order. The fact that Squirtle and their evolutions are sometimes found on marine islands seemed to support this connection as well. Some scientists have proposed that these similarities are merely the result of convergent evolution, however, citing DNA differences and fossil records as evidence.","While the scientific community has reached a consensus regarding Blastoise’s classifications as chelonians, there is some dispute as to which other Pokémon they are most closely related to.

Machamp are thought to be one of man’s closest Pokémon brethren, surpassed only by Mr. Mime and a few others. Though they may appear vaguely reptilian, their opposable thumbs and distinctly mammalian anatomies prove otherwise. In popular culture, Machamp are often seen as counterparts of Alakazam, representing the age-old struggle of “brains versus brawn.”","Machamp are classified as primates, and are prime candidates for a new proposed grouping named “humanoids;” the group would, as the name suggests, consist of Pokémon that resemble and are closely related to people.

In addition to their dietary habits, the two Pokémon also dwell in humid environments, oftentimes in places with acidic soil. The sweet-smelling, aromatic compound that Carnivine drool to attract prey has been found to be the same substance that is present in the acid of the Bellsprout line, also giving it a saccharine fragrance. It is a surprise to many people that their next closest relatives are Cacturne and Maractus, especially given how the latter two reside exclusively in arid deserts; DNA sequencing was the primary evidence in establishing this connection.","As carnivorous plant-like Pokémon, Victreebel are most closely related to Carnivine.

These Pokémon are infamous for being abundant in oceans across the world. Tentacool are the most common source of Pokémon-related injury on beaches, stinging unfortunate swimmers and anglers as they drift about in shallow water. Because so much of their bodies are made of water, one would think that they would be very sensitive to water pollution. Their Poison-typings, however, enable them to survive even in sullied seas. This in part explains their plentifulness near human settlements.","The cnidarians Tentacool and Tentacruel are very closely related to Jellicent, though it comes as a surprise to many that they are also relatives of Corsola.

In particular, they are perissodactyls, meaning that they have an odd number of toes. It is no surprise that their closest living relatives are Mudsdale and Zebstrika, who share their general physiology. Zebstrika even have a similar diet and habitat, though in different parts of the world.

Curiously, they don’t have the need to keep their skin moist like most amphibians, as they do not breathe through it. They have more complex lungs than their brethren, but their development seems to have occurred seperately from their evolution in reptiles and mammals, since the structures differs physiologically.

This puts them in the same group as Pokémon like Klingklang and Bronzong. Since they are inorganic, exactly where they fall in the classification system is uncertain. In systems where all Pokémon, both carbon-based and non-carbon-based, are placed in the same kingdom, they are either classified alongside Electrode on the grounds of their shared electrogenesis abilities, or with Metagross based on their shared electromagnetic abilities. Of course, there is also the very plausible possibility that one or more of these Pokémon arose independently of the others.","Magnezone are inorganic Pokémon that have metal-based bodies rather than carbon-based ones.

For this reason, information that would normally arise from naturalistic observation of the Pokémon is scarce. Regardless, they clearly appear to be waterfowl, grouped with Pokémon like Swanna and Golduck (though the placement of the latter is very controversial). Though they appear to be rather “generic” and typical of their order, they do have a notable adaptation in that their wings have evolved to become more finger-like in order to allow them to better grasp leeks. This is significant in that it is one of the few known natural cases where a species has evolved the ability to use tools.","Dodrio are odd in that they are flightless avians, a seeming oxymoron. Their wings have degenerated to the point of uselessness, though vestigial traces of them are still left in their skeletons and musculature. They are thought to be one of the most ancient of avians, having branched off far earlier than songbirds like Swellow or Altaria. They are believed to be the only known surviving member of an entire order of flightless birds, with some extinct members being much larger than the living Dodrio. They were incorrectly named after another extinct flightless avian, who in fact was more closely related to the extant Unfezant.","Dodrio are odd in that they are flightless avians, a seeming oxymoron.

One would think that this would qualify them as inorganic Pokémon, but this is not the case. Muk and their pre-evolutions consist primarily of carbon-based compounds. Additionally, the spontaneous creation of life from radiation is highly unlikely; instead, the most supported scientific hypothesis purports that the radiation affected microscopic life already in the water. Though the vast majority of exposed organisms died, one significant mutation led to the rise of Grimer. Since they could reproduce asexually, the Pokémon quickly spread throughout polluted waterways.","Grimer appear to have mutated spontaneously from polluted water and radioactive waste.

Another notable development in this line is the phenomenon in which Shellder lose their abilities to produce poison upon evolution into Cloyster. Since the poison is necessary to trigger the evolution of Slowpoke, Cloyster cannot parasitize them the same way their pre-evolutions can.

Their evolution Steelix, however, have metallic bodies, leading many to question why they are not classified alongside the likes of Klinklang and Metagross. Research shows that the extreme density of Steelix results from the extreme pressure of their underground habitats alongside their lithophagous diets. Trained Onix will not evolve into Steelix without the use of the synthetic Metal Coat. Thus, although Onix are capable of evolving into the metallic Steelix, they are naturally born with rock-based bodies and are classified as such.","Drowzee clearly seem to be mammalian, and indeed are classified as ungulates. Hypno appear more humanlike and unsettling to some, but they still maintain the long noses and pointed ears that Drowzee have. It is no surprise that their closest relatives are Musharna, who are also Psychic-type, dream-eating ungulates. Despite how different they may seem physically, the two Pokémon are thought to have diverged very recently; they internal anatomy is strikingly similar, with some vital organs being in different positions to accommodate for their different body shapes.","Drowzee clearly seem to be mammalian, and indeed are classified as ungulates.

Exeggutor are monocots, placing them in the same group as Lilligant. They are believed to be very similar to ancient Grass-type Pokémon; DNA analysis shows many similarities between them and true plants. Compared to other plantlike Pokémon, they are relatively simple in terms of physiology and anatomy. Their psychic abilities appear to be a relatively recent development, however. Researchers believe that they may have arisen around the same time Exeggutor evolved their polycephaly, perhaps as a way to allow the heads to communicate with each other through telepathy.","Though they may look like eggs, Exeggcute are in fact seeds.

Though some scientists speculated that they were perhaps amphibious or reptilian because of their long tongues, few bothered to conduct much research on them; the line has up until recently been woefully neglected by researchers for unknown reasons. Newer studies strongly suggest that they are in fact reptilian, however. Their skulls are clearly diapsid in nature, a distinctly reptilian trait (in addition to their tongues and tails). Their mammalian physiques likely result from their copious adipose tissue, a trait they oddly share with fellow pudgy squamatan Magmortar.","Weezing appear to be sentient, floating spheres of noxious gases, making them difficult to classify. However, it is known that their thin skin consists of cells unlike that of animal cells. They have cell walls that contain chitin, a trait that is exclusive to the fungal kingdom. For this reason, Weezing are placed alongside Pokémon like Breloom and Amoonguss. Thought to be the simplest organisms in this group, their toxic gas is believed to have been an evolutionary adaptation that turned their waste products into a weapon they could use against predators. Their thin, light skin enables them to float freely above the ground thanks to their buoyant gases.","Weezing appear to be sentient, floating spheres of noxious gases, making them difficult to classify.

Alongside Drowzee, Mareep, and Tepig (as well as potentially Spoink, though because of its unique form of locomotion this is debatable), Rhyhorn are among the minority of ungulates that become bipedal upon evolution; this chance in stance also comes with an increase in intelligence, a trend observed across multiple orders of Pokémon. Their characteristically thick and sturdy armor evolved to protect these sluggish, large herbivores from predators, much like the skin of their relative Donphan.","The Rhyhorn family are classic examples of ungulates, particularly of perissodactyls like Hypno, Zebstrika, and Rapidash.

This group is unique in that, unlike all other mammals, its members lay eggs instead of giving birth to live young under normal environmental conditions (all Pokémon that can reproduce in captivity will do so via eggs, a basal trait activated when normal mating conditions are not fulfilled). These Pokémon will lay sterile eggs even when not mating; these eggs are famously delicious and high in nutrients. The behavior of wild individuals has not been well-studied, as these Pokémon are rarely sighted and are quick to flee.","It is difficult to classify the Tangela line because no one has figured out what lies beneath the masses of vines that cover the Pokémon. From research done on vines that have snapped off of these Pokémon, it appears that they share an evolutionary relationship with seaweed and other forms of algae. However, DNA evidence also has revealed unexpressed genes that are identical to that of flowering plants, with similarities far closer than they share with algae. For this reason, despite carrying traits with both groups, they are classified as asterids alongside other flowering Pokémon like Sunflora; more research needs to be conducted in order to cement this placing.","Kangaskhan, as indicated by the pouches on their bellies, are marsupials. They, Komala, and Marowak are the only members of this group, which is thought to be more primitive than the larger group of placental mammals. Ironically, despite marsupials being characterized by their possessions of pouches for carrying their young, Kangaskhan are the only extant members that actually possess them (Marowak and Komala have lost their pouches over time). The process of imprinting between an infant Kangaskhan and its mother is currently being closely studied to discern the development of neural connections in young Pokémon.","Though they do not resemble them superficially, members of the Horsea line are classified as ray-finned fishes. It is no surprise that their closest relative is Dragalge, who share their characteristic upright posture. Genetic research on this line has revealed that Horsea and Seadra have dormant genes characteristic of Dragon-type Pokémon (as well as portions of DNA coding for the Poison-typing, though they lack complete genes; these sequences are inexplicably only expressed in Seadra). These genes activate when Seadra are exposed to Dragon Scales, trigger their evolutions into Kingdra. They were the first Pokémon in which this type of genetic expression was observed.","Though they do not resemble them superficially, members of the Horsea line are classified as ray-finned fishes.

They are very closely related to Gyarados, though the two Pokémon hardly resemble each other at all. Their common predecessor is believed to have been oceanic and much stronger than either of its descendants. Goldeen are thought to have adapted their trademark horns and vibrant colorations through sexual selection. It is unknown why the species are exclusively freshwater, but some scientists have hypothesized a catastrophic marine event that only allowed individuals living in secluded ponds and lakes to survive, eventually becoming Goldeen (Magikarp likely traded their strength for hardiness due to this event as well).","Seaking are bony fishes.

Echinoderms like Starmie are also notable for being the only invertebrates that are also deuterostomes, meaning that their digestive tracts develop mouth-second, like vertebrates.

Researchers agree that they are likely the closest link between people and Pokémon, citing support such as: their similar physiology, their great intellect, their affinities for towns and cities, their distinctly human-like skin, and their near-identical brain structures. The physical differences between people and Mr. Mime can largely be attributed to two primary differences. Firstly, these Pokémon store fat entirely in their torsos, giving them very slender limbs. Secondly, their joints are all synovial, allowing them to bend at odd, sometimes disturbing angles.","As their Bug-typings might suggest, members of the Scyther line are insects. They are very close relatives with Leavanny, who share the blade-like arms of Scyther (though their dispositions starkly contrast one another). This line is also believed to related to Kricketune, as their wings develop internally as opposed to externally like other insects. The evolution from Scyther to Scizor is believed to be one of the most drastic known so far. Scyther are swift and speedy pack hunters capable of flight, while Scizor are sturdy but slower solitary predators that are confined to the ground; the two don’t even seem to recognize each other as the same species in the wild.","Jynx are distinctly humanoid, sometimes even being mistaken for people from behind. Because they are so elusive, they are difficult subjects for scientists to research in the wild. No one is quite sure what Jynx conceal beneath their billowing “dresses”; they leave no footprints behind as they walk, though some believe that they may simply be using their psychic powers to levitate. Both Smoochum and Jynx have very thin skin that makes them susceptible to changes in atmospheric humidity. Their skin is particularly fragile around their lips, which also have a large number of nerve endings. ","The Elekid line are classified as primates, specifically as apes because of the lumbering body structure of Electivire. They share this trait with Darmanitan and Rillaboom, their fellow apes and closest relatives. Though primates have a reputation for being unusually intelligent, the Elekid line seems to display average intellect for Pokémon; the more agile primates, like Ambipom, Infernape, the Simi monkeys, and especially Oranguru fit this perception more than Electivire. Despite this, the ratio of their brain mass to body mass is noticeably larger than that of other Pokémon, a trait indicative of all species classified as primates.","The Magby line was an enigma to scientists; Magmar (the most common member of the lien in the wild) had a Psyduck’s bill but a Charmeleon’s tail, leading to some conclusion regarding its classification. Subsequent studies on the Pokémon along with its evolutions brought evidence that they were definitively reptilian, albeit with large deposits of adipose tissue that gave them their stocky builds. They share this trait with Lickilicky, who also confused researchers because of its odd body shape. Because of their curious behavior regarding volcanoes, scientists are looking into studying the behavior of Magby in order to predict volcanic eruptions.","Pinsir are clearly coleopterans. Though they seem to lack the wings that other Pokémon in this order like Ledian possess, they do in fact sport a rudimentary pair. Their elytra have fused together to form solid armor-like platings however, rendering the weak wings within useless (though the vestigial wings would not be strong enough to allow them to fly, anyways). Mega-Evolution splits the fused elytra and strengthens the wings enough to allow these Pokémon to fly. Pinsir are very close cousins of Vikavolt, though they are more commonly associated with Heracross. The two Pokémon are often depicted as a duo in popular media.","The distant ancestors of Tauros once ruled the Kanto region. With the advent of humans, though, these wild Pokémon slowly became domesticated as cattle, leaving only pockets of wild populations. Alola is thought to be the first region to domesticate Tauros. Despite the tamed cattle being weaker in virtually all respects, they outnumbered wild Tauros and easily outcompeted them for grazing land. At one point, wild Tauros were on the brink of extinction. Luckily, advances in agriculture allowed farmers to make greater use of their land and slowed their expansion, allowing populations to recover. However, even today, they remain only a shadow of their former glory.","Gyarados are thought to be rather ancient Pokémon, having changed little over the centuries. Their closest relatives are believed to be Seaking, fellow bony fishes that they are thought to share a common ancestor with. Fossil evidence shows that the famously weak Magikarp in fact may have been far more powerful in the past, with strength fitting of Pokémon that evolve into vicious Gyarados. It is thought that a catastrophic ocean event led to the selection of hardy but weak Magikarp over less resilient but stronger ones. Gyarados lay many, many eggs, so that even if the majority of their offspring die off, their genes would still carry on to the next generation.","Gyarados are thought to be rather ancient Pokémon, having changed little over the centuries.

However, they are actually a separate order entirely, thought to have evolved from a group of primitive, terrestrial reptiles that returned to the sea. The size and the barrenness of the polar habitats of these Pokémon were the main factors that allowed them to survive for so long despite being so gentle. Because they only give birth to one offspring at a time and their said offspring take years to mature, conservation efforts regarding this Pokémon are slow (though they have been notably successful in Alola).","Ditto are odd Pokémon. They consist of nothing more than a blob of cells; however, what makes them special is the abilities of their cells to differentiate into anything, organic or inorganic (the latter of which baffles scientists even to this day). There are two competing theories as to how they arose. One postulates that Ditto branched off from the very beginning of all life, possessing the simplest cell structure with two simple mutations: the process of cell division, and the lack of permanent cell differentiation. The other is similar, hypothesizing that Ditto may have sprung from failed experiments regarding Mew, who is thought to be the “ancestor of all Pokémon.”","Eevee are related to vulpines like Ninetales and Zoroark; some scientists even believe that they were even bred from the common ancestor of these Pokémon. Their unstable DNA is thought to have been a byproduct of generations of inbreeding to select traits desirable in a pet. Though all Eeveelutions are adapted to a different environment, they all are exceedingly rare in the wild, and are adapted to life alongside people. It is notable that two of them (Espeon and Umbreon), evolve based on developing trust between themselves and their trainers, while a third (Sylveon), evolves based on creating a strong emotional bond.","Eevee are related to vulpines like Ninetales and Zoroark; some scientists even believe that they were even bred from the common ancestor of these Pokémon.

Porygon-Z was an unauthorized update created by an unknown group of hackers. Some people believe that Team Galactic created the patch while perfecting interdimensional travel, while others think that Team Plasma scientist Colress covertly created Porygon-Z at the P2 Laboratory in Unova. Though owning a Porygon-Z is technically illegal, the Pokémon has become so famous (including a starring role in a popular video game as a corrupt research facility AI) that Silph Co. has ceased taking action against its owners.","Scientists believe that Omastar were among the most intelligent Pokémon in prehistoric times. This is supported by the fact that their modern ancestors, cephalopods like Octillery and Malamar, are also notoriously clever. These Pokémon are also notable for being the only cephalopods with shells, a trait that is present in some gastropods like Shelmet and Macargo. The spiral designs of their shells are characteristic of the fossils that these Pokémon can be revived from (hence why they are called “Helix Fossils”), and have been used throughout history as symbols of enlightenment.","Scientists believe that Omastar were among the most intelligent Pokémon in prehistoric times.

Though they are related to both insects and crustaceans, they are grouped separately from both. One of their most amazing characteristics is their possession of lungs; though dissimilar to vertebrate lungs and rather inefficient, they are one of few known invertebrates that have developed complex organs for breathing rather than networks of tubes. These lungs allowed Kabutops to be among the first terrestrial hunters, thriving as apex predators for a long period of time before eventually being starved to extinction during a global fluctuation of temperatures.","Kabutops are arthropods, and are the only member of their order to have been successfully revived.

Instead, they are placed in their own entire order, thought to have descended independently from other ancient reptiles. Another common piece of misinformation regarding these Pokémon is that they are related to Archeops, and by extension, are the ancestors of modern avian Pokémon. This is not, true, either; the advent of flight in Aerodactyl and Archeops more than likely occurred independently, especially considering how Aerodactyl have membraned wings while Archeops have feathered ones. Aerodactyl is no more related to today’s birds than other reptiles like Rampardos or Aurorus.","It may be physically difficult to discern exactly what Snorlax are because of the large amounts of fat concealing most of their features. However, from skeletal and physiological examinations, it is clear that these Pokémon are ursines, related to the likes of Ursaring and Beartic. It is notable that the members of this family hibernate, sleeping throughout the winter while living off of energy reserves gathered prior to their dormancy. Many scientists believe that the lengthy sleeping and eating patterns of Snorlax is the result of the trigger for their hibernation somehow being left perpetually in the “on” position.","","","","Dragonite are classified as serpents despite the fact that they have limbs; the reasoning behind this choice is readily apparent when one looks at both Dratini and Dragonair. Though the serpents have lost their limbs through evolution, they still maintain vestigial traces of the structures. This is most apparent when one looks at the Snivy line, which serves as a counterpart to the Dratini line in that it loses its limbs as it evolves rather than gaining them. Seeing how Dragonite appear distinctly draconian, it is thought that when Dragonair evolve, a number of different primal, reptilian genes trigger the growth of their limbs and wings.","Dragonite are classified as serpents despite the fact that they have limbs; the reasoning behind this choice is readily apparent when one looks at both Dratini and Dragonair.

Members of the Chikorita line are famed for their aromatherapeutic qualities. Extractions from their leaves and flowers have been used in the production of perfumes and essential oils. While Chikorita’s smell has been described, unsurprisingly, as “floral” and “grassy,” Bayleef’s has been compared to the aromas of rosemary and camphor. Meganium have the ability to produce both of their pre-evolutions’ scents alongside a multitude of others from their large flowers.","Meganium are the prototypical example of a sauropod; long-necked, quadrupedal, and herbivorous, these slow-moving saurians are very docile compared to the more aggressive theropods.

Its closest relatives are thought to be Meinshao and Furret, with Weavile and Floatzel being more distant, though still in the same family. The mustelids are distinct in undergoing embryonic diapause, in which they can “pause” the development of their offspring in the womb until environmental conditions become more favorable. Timid Cyndaquil undergo a radical change in temperament as they evolve into the irate Typhlosion; it has been researched that Typhlosion that can produce larger bursts of flames are also more aggressive, possibly signaling a chemical connection between firepower and temperament.","The Cyndaquil family is classified as a mustelid.

Their closest relative is Krookodile; though physiologically similar, the two belong to different families, of which they are each the only surviving members of. The two groups are most easily distinguished by their snout shape, with Feraligatr’s family having narrower snouts. The crocodilians are notable for being more closely related to saurians than to other reptiles.

Their docile demeanors distinguish them from their more aggressive relatives, such as Typhlosion and Weavile. They are thought to have evolved their long bodies in order easily and swiftly enter and exit their underground burrows to escape predators. Sentret are notable for their unique social structure. Though many Pokémon exhibit similar behavior, Sentret are notable for being altruistic while doing so; similar to the unrelated Patrat, guarding Sentret will call loudly and place themselves on higher ground to attract threats to themselves and allow their allies to hide and retreat.","Furret are classic examples of mustelids, with their closest relative being Meinshao.

They are the sole order of nocturnal birds of prey; though often depicted alongside the diurnal birds of prey like Pidgeot and Staraptor in Johto and Sinnoh works, representing knowledge and cunning, other regions delegate this role to Mandibuzz instead. Their ability to learn a variety of Psychic-type moves, along with their purported penchants for clairvoyance, have led many to wonder why they are not Psychic-types. While the significance of this fact is unknown, it should be noted that Noctowl are the closest known relatives of the true Psychic-type Xatu.","Noctowl are avians in the order Strigiformes alongside Decidueye and Aromatisse.

Ledyba are among the most beloved insects in the world, due to their docile natures and integral role as pollinators both in nature as well as in the agricultural industry. The powder that Ledian scatter at night seems to serve no known purpose. It is composed primarily of chitin, like the scales of Dustox and Vivillon, but is structured differently from the powder they shed and does not carry the same effects--or any noticeable effects at all, to be precise.","Ledian are the the coleopterans with the most easily distinguishable elytra (other than arguably Heracross during flight), and for this reason are commonly used to symbolize this order; they are also more charismatic than their close relatives Orbeetle.

One of their defining features is their unique jaw structures, referred to as chelicerae. As one may guess, their closest relatives are Galvantula and Araquanid, who have similar body structures. Though it is arguable whether Ariados or Drapion have the strongest venom of the arachnids, most researchers agree that Ariados has the fastest-acting one, capable of killing an adult human in as little as two minutes (Drapion also prefer to disable prey with brute force and rarely use their venom at all). Their strong silk has been intensely researched for potential applications in various fields of science.","Members of the Spinarak line are arthropods, specifically arachnids.

These Pokémon are in fact mammals, belonging to the order Chiroptera. Alongside their brethren Noivern and Swoobat, they are the only known mammals with wings. Zubat in particular are notable for being troglobites, having lost their eyes and noses to adapt to life in complete darkness; they rely on echolocation to navigate. Though both Golbat and Crobat possess eyes, these organs are weak and function primarily as light detectors, so they still rely on their senses of sound when flying about.","Lanturn are bony, ray-finned fish most famous for their bioluminescent capabilities. Though they may appear to lack dorsal fins, their glowing lures are in fact modified dorsal rays. Chinchou also possess the ability to walk on the sea floor with their feet-like dorsal fins. They share this trait with Lumineon, another bony fish that dwells at the bottom of the sea. Chinchou also use these modified fins to trek onto land while mating. They can stay out of the water as long as their skin remains moist, and are better terrestrial travelers than some other amphibious Pokémon like Poliwag. Their eggs incubate while hidden in the sand from predators.","Lanturn are bony, ray-finned fish most famous for their bioluminescent capabilities.

Though slightly more common in Johto, they still are by no means abundant Pokémon. These Pokémon are most closely related to Plusle and Minun; although many people believe that they are related to Azumarill, the two Pokémon are in fact not even in the same order. Likely because Raichu are even rarer than Pikachu, in a recent poll conducted by the Unova branch of the Pokémon Fan Club, 45% of the people surveyed were unaware that Pikachu evolved at all.","Cleffa and their evolutions are one of the most elusive Pokémon known to man, other than legendary Pokémon. For this reason, many people thought they were a myth up until recent times. Even now, the Cleffa line is a conundrum to modern phylogenetics. Traditionally, they were thought to be most closely related to Wigglytuff. However, a quickly growing sect of scientists, including nearly all of the researchers stationed at Mt. Moon (where Clefairy are most abundant), have lent their support to the idea that they are in fact extraterrestrial Pokémon with no evolutionary connections to any other worldly Pokémon.","Wigglytuff are lagomorphs, and are thought to be most closely related to the Pokémon Azumarill. Both Pokémon share the characteristics of long ears and rotund bodies. However, while Azumarill and their pre-evolutions have developed oil sacs attached to their bodies like tails to stay afloat in the water, Wigglytuff and their pre-evolutions have evolved air sacs within their bodies to float about in the winds. Interestingly, both of these adaptations serve similar purposes, only in different mediums. The singing ability of this line appears to be a secondary development as a byproduct of their huge air sacs.","Togekiss are thought to be a relatively primitive species of birds, notably lacking the talons present in the vast majority of other species. Their thick layers of feathers and adipose tissues give them their distinctively plump shape. Togepi have been intensely researched in order to learn more about maternal imprinting, particularly for applications in the upbringings of other children and young Pokémon. Meanwhile, Togetic’s joy dust is being tested for use as an antidepressant. Togekiss are heralded as symbols of world peace and have historically been a common mascot of many nonviolent protest organizations.","Togekiss are thought to be a relatively primitive species of birds, notably lacking the talons present in the vast majority of other species.

Though Noctowl are a temperate species while Xatu are a tropical one, both play large roles in their regions’ cultures and are purported be clairvoyant. Additionally, their pre-evolutions share an odd tendency to not blink, perhaps an adaptation to unnerve larger predators when in large flocks. The accuracy of prophet-aided Xatu auguries is debatable.

Whereas the Igglybuff has air sacs that allow them to inflate, the Azumarill line (in addition to strong lungs) also has oil sacs that aid them in swimming. Azurill are the only known Pokémon to undergo protogyny, a bizarre phenomenon in which a third of female Azurill become male upon evolution. Since Azurill themselves are unable to breed, researchers have ruled out reproductive benefits for such an adaptation. The current theory suggests that this occurrence may simply be due to a mutated sex allele in some female Azurill that would normally make them male but is not expressed until evolution.","Azumarill are lagomorphs most closely related to Wigglytuff and Lopunny.

The line is notable for providing strong evidence supporting a common origin for inorganic and organic Pokémon; unlike Pokémon like Electrode or Klinklang, scientists agree that Sudowoodo’s camouflage was adapted over time through natural selection and speciation. As one of the only inorganic Pokémon found outside of an environment composed primarily of what they themselves are made of (in other words, as Rock-types found outside of rocky areas), this adaptation showed that they could evolve over time instead of spontaneously forming from their basic elements.","Most wild Poliwhirl don’t evolve, as neither Water Stones nor King’s Rocks are common items. Naturally, the Pokémon are neotenous, as they never mature into the standard morphology of typical anurans (for example, Greninja). Even upon evolution into Poliwrath, they still don’t quite resemble adult Pokémon from their order. This contrast is most apparent when Poliwag are compared with Tympole; while Poliwag and Tympole resemble each other, Poliwrath and Seismitoad seem far more disparate. Scientists think that Politoed represent what the Pokémon would look like if they weren’t neotenous, though the evolutionary advantage of neoteny is still a mystery.","As unitegmic asterids, Jumpluff are very closely related to their fellow Grass-type Sunflora. Though some believe they are also related to Whimsicott because of their cotton-like features, the two are not actually even in the same order. One of their characteristic features is their aerially-dispersed spores, which help them propagate over wide swathes of land as they float about. The fact that the spores of female Jumpluff can independently develop into clones of their parents is also interesting. Their high fecundity is likely is what allows Hoppip, who are relatively weak and are easy prey for many Pokémon despite their bitter leaves, to continue to survive as a species.","As unitegmic asterids, Jumpluff are very closely related to their fellow Grass-type Sunflora.

Possessing large brains and the ability to use tools (such as sharpened sticks for piercing the rinds of fruit), Aipom are popular in media as playful, cunning (but not malicious) tricksters. Both Aipom and Ambipom have evolved tails that function much like hands, complete with finger-like appendages. Their hands have atrophied in vestigial remnants over time; they likely evolved this way because of how they spend their lives swinging in trees by their tails. Similarly, their feet are also not well-suited for walking, though not as weak as their hands.","Sunflora are related to their fellow unitegmic asterid Jumpluff. Sunkern are known for being one of the weakest Pokémon known; their continued survival seems to be due almost entirely to their vast numbers and the reproductive speed of their evolutions (a trait they share with their relative Hoppip). Sunflora are thought to be one of the most plant-like Pokémon; their strict dependency on sunlight, for example, contrasts how most other Grass-types are able to supplement their diets with traditional foods. This trait, however, also makes Sunflora easy to raise even in large numbers (such as in Sunflora “gardens”), since sustenance essentially becomes a non-issue for them.","Sunflora are related to their fellow unitegmic asterid Jumpluff.

Yanmega are thought to be living fossils that have changed little from millions of years ago. As menacing as they are today, some of the line’s now-extinct relatives are thought to have been even larger than Yanmega. It is thought that a decrease in available atmospheric oxygen prevented these relatives from thriving, allowing the “smaller” Yanmega to proliferate. These Pokémon are notable for their unique, elongated body plan, their blistering speed, and their ability to hover in the air. ","Quagsire are clearly urodelans, with their closest relative being the Slowpoke line. They are particularly notable for how some populations of wild Wooper are neotenous; they manage to go their entire lives--including mating and reproduction--without evolving. Wooper are more tolerant of fluctuations in factors such as temperature, water salinity, and pH than Quagsire, and thus can dwell in some environments that their evolutions cannot. Additionally, they are more proactive in hunting and are coated in poisonous film, both of which help them survive a broader range of situations than Quagsire. The exact trigger for their neoteny is complex and remains a mystery.","Quagsire are clearly urodelans, with their closest relative being the Slowpoke line.

Their unstable DNA is thought to have been a byproduct of generations of inbreeding to select traits desirable in a pet. Though all Eeveelutions are adapted to a different environment, they all are exceedingly rare in the wild, and are adapted to life alongside people. It is notable that two of them (Espeon and Umbreon), evolve based on developing trust between themselves and their trainers, while a third (Sylveon), evolves based on creating a strong emotional bond.","Eevee are related to vulpines like Ninetales and Zoroark; some scientists even believe that they were even bred from the common ancestor of these Pokémon.

They are largely nocturnal, but can be found active during the day in dark places. These Pokémon are well known for their unique social structure, in which flocks of Murkrow “henchmen” serve a single Honchkrow boss, defending the territory as well as bringing back food and shiny loot. Why exactly they are so fascinated with reflective objects is unknown, but scientists theorize that Honchkrow gauge the sizes of their rivals’ hoards in order to judge their might. Thus, they may attempt to create large collections of shiny objects in order to assert their dominance against rival Honchkrow with smaller piles.","The Slowpoke line seems to be an amalgamation of reptilian, amphibious, and mammalian traits. They seem to be evolutionary closest to the amphibians; specifically, they are urodelans, alongside the likes of Quagsire and Swampert. Curiously, they don’t have the need to keep their skin moist like most amphibians, as they do not breathe through it. They have more complex lungs than their brethren, but their development seems to have occurred seperately from their evolution in reptiles and mammals, since the structures differs physiologically. Shellder poison seems to activate the production of a hormone that triggers their evolution and mental stimulation.","Mismagius are ethereal Pokémon with mostly gaseous bodies. They, however, are tangible (unlike their fellow Ghost-type, Gengar). While most other Ghost-types either have membranes or material bodies, Mismagius lack any sort of protective covering; their bodies billow like smoke as they travel, held together by some currently unknown force. Their ability to seemingly materialize and disappear at will makes them difficult to study in the wild. These Pokémon are also related to Mimikyu, Drifblim, and Banette, the last of which with whom they share their typing, body composition, and diet; Banette are characterized by their distinct, cloth bodies, however.","Unown are enigmatic Pokémon that seem to defy many of the basic rules of science itself. They do not seem to eat or breathe, spending most of their time stuck to the walls of ruins, sometimes in text-like patterns. In swarms they are said to trigger inexplicable phenomena that warp the reality of the world; many myths connect them to legendary Pokémon like Arceus, Dialga, and Palkia, among others. The organization of Unown into specific shapes and orders appears to trigger different effects. Because of the potentially catastrophic havoc experimenting with the abilities of Unown may wreak on the world, however, such testing is severely restricted.","Wynaut and Wobbuffet seem to be very primitive Pokémon evolution-wise. Despite their upright statures, they are invertebrates. Research strongly suggests that their true brains--and most vital organs, for that matter--lie in their tails; the blue structures once thought to be their bodies are in fact elaborate decoys. A rudimentary set of nerves, cartilage, and an esophagus allow them to move, eat, and vocalize; however, the bulk of both systems lies in their tails. Though the tails can survive without their decoys, they to lose their countering abilities and become helpless if separated. They seem to be capable of immobilizing foes with strong psychic powers if threatened.","Girafarig are artiodactyl ungulates, making them relatives of Camerupt and Sawsbuck. They are most famous for their two opposing heads. Their main heads are rather standard for Psychic-type Pokémon, being the source of their psychic abilities. Their rear heads, however, seem to function independently of their main heads’ judgements and work primarily based on instinct. They will lash out at anything that comes too near, whether or not the Girafarig themselves are frightened, for example. They learn by smell association--Girafarig poachers would scent themselves with Girafarig musk so that they could sneak up right behind the Pokémon without being attacked.","Although Pineco superficially resemble pinecones (and Forretress rocks), both Pokémon are lepidopterans that have developed carapaces that help them hide and defend against predators. They share this trait with the very closely related Wormadam; however, the Pineco line is believed to be neotenous, as they don’t attain physical traits normally associated with lepidopteran adults. Much like Wormadam, they never gain wings and remain flightless (compared to male Burmy that evolve into airborne Mothim). Scientists believe that perpetually “juvenile” individuals with hard shells likely had a higher survival rate than fragile adults, explaining the evolutionary quirk.","Although Pineco superficially resemble pinecones (and Forretress rocks), both Pokémon are lepidopterans that have developed carapaces that help them hide and defend against predators.

These serpents are adapted to life in caves, their eyes having withered away into vestigial organs from generations of disuse. They are feeble creatures that cannot easily defend themselves from attackers; their main method of defense is to burrow away into the ground. It is a surprise to many that Dunsparce are the closest living relatives of the powerful Dragonite. Scientists believe that the ancestors of these Pokémon may have been aquatic like Dratini; a population in a cavernous lake may have gradually adapted to to life not only in the dark, but on land as well to avoid predators in the water.","The Gliscor line are unique among the arthropods in their method of flight. Rather than possessing wings, they have membranes that allow them to glide (in the case of Gligar) or fly (Gliscor) through the air. As arachnids, they are very closely related to Drapion; both possess pincers and stingers, although their positions are reversed from one another. The two Pokémon have very similar venoms, and can in fact be treated with the same antivenom. In the past, many believed that these Pokémon were hematophagous like the similar-looking Golbat. However, despite their appearances, the Pokémon are unrelated, and Gliscor have not been ever reported to suck blood.","Onix are rock-based Pokémon, putting them in the same family as Golem and Probopass. Their evolution Steelix, however, have metallic bodies, leading many to question why they are not classified alongside the likes of Klinklang and Metagross. Research shows that the extreme density of Steelix results from the extreme pressure of their underground habitats alongside their lithophagous diets. Trained Onix will not evolve into Steelix without the use of the synthetic Metal Coat. Thus, although Onix are capable of evolving into the metallic Steelix, they are naturally born with rock-based bodies and are classified as such.","Granbull are canines, and one of the group’s most archetypical examples at that. Many canines are known for their affinity for humans and easy domestication; indeed, like Growlithe, Lillipup, and Furfrou, Snubbull and Granbull are common pets even for people that aren’t Pokémon trainers. Their signature characteristic is their protruding lower jaws, which are so heavy that they sometimes impede their ability to stand totally upright. Although they can deliver one of the strongest bite forces known to man, it is believed that they are more of a visual warning than a functional one; Granbull rarely bite, and it takes them great effort to actually do so.","Granbull are canines, and one of the group’s most archetypical examples at that.

Their closest living relatives are Bruxish and surprisingly Alomomola, who, despite their strikingly different physical appearances, share a similar bone structure with them (much of a Qwilfish’s body consists of an elastic sac that holds the water it swallows and allows it to expand). These Pokémon are very poor swimmers. Their spherical bodies are not at all hydrodynamic, and their lack of both pectoral and dorsal fins make it difficult to navigate. However, their spines and venom are more than adequate defenses to protect these clumsy creatures.","As their Bug-typings might suggest, members of the Scyther line are insects. They are very close relatives with Leavanny, who share the blade-like arms of Scyther (though their dispositions starkly contrast one another). This line is also believed to related to Kricketune, as their wings develop internally as opposed to externally like other insects. The evolution from Scyther to Scizor is believed to be one of the most drastic known so far. Scyther are swift and speedy pack hunters capable of flight, while Scizor are sturdy but slower solitary predators that are confined to the ground; the two don’t even seem to recognize each other as the same species in the wild.","Shuckle appear to be a very primitive type of fungi; most of their bodies are composed entirely of soft tissue. Contrary to popular belief, Shuckle do not create their own shells from rocks (this behavior is more typical of the Pokémon Dwebble). They are actually born with these shells, which are intially soft but quickly harden upon contact with air. Unlike other naturally-occuring shells, Shuckle shells are not primarily composed of calcium, but instead carbon. Their shells are one of the hardest substances known to man, and are the subject of intense research for industrial uses. Shuckle juices are also highly valued as natural, organic “superjuices” for the health-conscious.","Heracross are one of the most popular coleopterans in modern media, commonly depicted alongside the Pokémon Pinsir. While Pinsir are both aggressive and carnivorous, Heracross are docile and herbivorous. There are entire television shows dedicated towards watching the two Pokémon fight against--or alongside--one another (though in Kanto notably, it is more common to see Pinsir paired alongside Scyther). Although they rarely open their elytra, Heracross are perfectly capable of flight (albeit clumsily); the same cannot be said for the Mega Evolutions, however, who are too heavy to fly and use their wings primarily for temperature regulation.","Weavile are members of the mammalian group known as the mustelids, with their closest relatives being Floatzel. They are adapted to snowy environments, particularly boreal forests. However, they are more tolerant of heat than most Ice-types. One of their most curious adaptations are the feather-like appendages that sprout on their heads and tails. They were once proposed to determine the ranking of members in a pack, but research shows that such rankings don’t exist in their packs. The leading theory now points to them being an indicator of sexual fitness; it should be noted that female Sneasel have shorter “feathers” than male ones.","Ursaring are very closely related to Bewear, Beartic, and Pangoro, as all of them are ursids. Based on their hibernation patterns and the reliance of Teddiursa on Beedrill honey, it seems that Ursaring are adapted to temperate climates. Because humans have increasingly urbanized such areas, encounters with wild Ursaring have become more common in cities over the years; some even have learned to lurk around Berry trees in suburban areas for food. The connection between Ursaring and the moon is uncertain; their rings glow faintly when exposed to moonlight. Some believe that Ursaring may regulate their internal cycles based on the moon rather than the sun.","Ursaring are very closely related to Bewear, Beartic, and Pangoro, as all of them are ursids.

They were once thought to have had inorganic origins, perhaps related to rock-based Pokémon like Golem. Their thin skins, however, are distinctly organic in composition, and though they have developed to resist the extreme heat of their environments, their open circulatory systems greatly resemble that of other mollusks in general plan. In the food-poor environment of active volcanoes, perhaps evolving the ability to withstand and obtain nutrients from magma was critical to their success.","Slugma and Magcargo are creatures of lava, with body systems that have been drastically modified from their closest gastropodan relatives--Goodra and Gastrodon.

Though they have been traditionally classified with the former due to their quadrupedal nature and possession of tusks, many scientists today believe that they are much more closely related to the latter, primarily citing their physiology and short snouts. Mamoswine are famously prehistoric, most notably with one individual being successfully thawed from ice after being frozen for thousands of years. While Swinub and Piloswine can be found in a number of snowy areas, Mamoswine only inhabit the most frozen glaciers of the world.","There is some debate as to whether these ancient Pokémon are more closely related to the modern Donphan or Emboar.

Their horns, both live and discarded, form the foundation of reefs, providing nooks and crannies for small Pokémon to hide in. However, because Corsola are very sensitive to changes in temperature and water purity, the reefs that they form are also fragile. Most notably, the worldwide increase in pollution levels due to human activity has adversely affected Corsola reefs, causing them to decay and shrink in area. Fierce conservation efforts to protect these Pokémon and the ecosystems they support are underway. These surprisingly-close relatives of Tentacruel are also lauded for their regenerative abilities.","Given how dissimilar Remoraid and Octillery are, it is no surprise that scientists didn’t realize that the two Pokémon were related for a long time. Even today, it is a common misconception that neither of them have any evolutionary relatives. Their physical disparity is only exacerbated by the fact that while Octillery are exclusively maritime, Remoraid venture into freshwater rivers for a portion of their lives; inland anglers may encounter Remoraid with some frequency while never seeing their evolutions. The line is thought to be most closely related to Malamar, as its most mature stage shares both physiological characteristics as well as breeding habits with it.","Given how dissimilar Remoraid and Octillery are, it is no surprise that scientists didn’t realize that the two Pokémon were related for a long time.

Their closest relatives, Empoleon, have adapted to an amphibious lifestyle; indeed, it is very strange that Delibird, with their flippers and pseudo-webbed feet, dwell atop icy peaks rather than near the water. This heavily suggests that they have branched off very recently from their relatives. Delibird in Alola are tolerable of temperate climates, providing further evidence. It should be noted that their wide feet, though not used for swimming, help keep Delibird from sinking in the snow as they waddle.","Surprisingly, Mantine are the closest living relatives of Sharpedo—both have cartilaginous skeletons rather than bony ones. These gentle giants are famous for their mutualistic relationship with the much smaller Remoraid. In fact, the two have coevolved to depend upon one another for survival. Mantyke are large baby Pokémon that are easy targets for predators, so they will swim alongside schools of Remoraid for protection; conversely, Remoraid are eager to latch onto Mantyke once they grow large enough for easy food and travel until they evolve. In fact, the successful attachment of a Remoraid to a Mantyke triggers the latter’s evolution into Mantine.","Skarmory are avians with an entire scientific family to call their own. They are known in popular culture for their ruthless behavior, and are often depicted as villains in movies and television shoes. In the scientific world, they have garnered considerable interest because of their unique physiology; despite having tough, iron-hard feathers, they are very lightweight and capable of flying at high speeds. As such, Skarmory have been considered as models for both military aircrafts. Some consider Skarmory to be a more extreme version of Fearow; both are hardy avians that are often characterized as cruel, but Skarmory will inhabit wastelands even Fearow cannot tolerate.","Houndoom are very closely related to Arcanine, Granbull, and Stoutland. Unlike the aforementioned Pokémon, which are widely domesticated, though, Houndoom are much closer to the group’s feral roots, sharing this trait with Lycanroc and Manectric. While its fellow Fire-type canid Arcanine have evolved to thrive on plains and prairies, with plenty of open space to run free, Houndoom have adapted to survive in dense forests and rocky, uneven badlands. They trade Arcanine’s bulk and raw speed for a more streamlined figure and increased agility, allowing them to chase down scarce prey in their unforgiving habitats.","Houndoom are very closely related to Arcanine, Granbull, and Stoutland.

It is no surprise that their closest relative is Dragalge, who share their characteristic upright posture. Genetic research on this line has revealed that Horsea and Seadra have dormant genes characteristic of Dragon-type Pokémon (as well as portions of DNA coding for the Poison-typing, though they lack complete genes; these sequences are inexplicably only expressed in Seadra). These genes activate when Seadra are exposed to Dragon Scales, trigger their evolutions into Kingdra. They were the first Pokémon in which this type of genetic expression was observed.","In traditional biology, these Pokémon are believed to be the modern descendants of the prehistoric Mamoswine, though some scientists today believe that Mamoswine are in fact more closely related to Emboar. Donphan are one of the most iconic Pokémon of the plains; the image of a herd of the Pokémon rolling across the savannah has been used in countless forms of media to set a safari-like theme. Donphan are also the face of conservation ecology as one of the field’s first major successes; once endangered due to poaching for their ivory tusks, tireless efforts to raise awareness of their plight have reduced demand for their tusks to practically zero. ","In traditional biology, these Pokémon are believed to be the modern descendants of the prehistoric Mamoswine, though some scientists today believe that Mamoswine are in fact more closely related to Emboar.

Porygon-Z was an unauthorized update created by an unknown group of hackers. Some people believe that Team Galactic created the patch while perfecting interdimensional travel, while others think that Team Plasma scientist Colress covertly created Porygon-Z at the P2 Laboratory in Unova. Though owning a Porygon-Z is technically illegal, the Pokémon has become so famous (including a starring role in a popular video game as a corrupt research facility AI) that Silph Co. has ceased taking action against its owners.","Stantler are very close relatives with Sawsbuck. Unlike their seasonal relatives, however, they are adapted to a rather wide range of environments. In addition to being at home in the deciduous forests that Sawsbuck dwell in, they can also be found in coniferous and boreal forests, as well as some rocky mountains. The mystifying properties of their horns are very interesting; this power originates from the black orbs in the antlers. Chemical analyses of powdered Stantler horns reveal that their composition is very similar to soporific plant-based substances. It is still unknown, however, how they are able to induce trance-like states in mere onlookers.","Closely related to Granbull, Smeargle are famed for their artistic capabilities. They are a favorite amongst painters, who both teach and learn techniques from these Pokémon. Individual Smeargle develop their own art styles as they become more experienced, and art from famous ones have sold for millions. Their other unique ability is the move Sketch, which allows them to permanently replicate any attack they witness by etching its likeness in painting. Scientists have tried to figure this process out for years, but to no avail. One Johto researcher was recorded throwing her hands up and saying, “I don’t know, just look at it and tell that this thing breathing fire is logical.”","The Tyrogue line is undisputedly humanoid, sharing a similar morphology to humans. They also seem to support the trend of humanoids sporting either Psychic- or Fighting-typings (in this case the latter), a phenomenon that is being intensely researched today in hopes of establishing a true link between people and Pokémon. The characteristic adaptation of this line appears to be the unique structure of their limbs, which allow them to throw out punches and kicks farther than they may appear to be able to. Tyrogue’s evolution appear to be directly connected to how the Pokémon train, with different fighting styles triggering different evolution-inducing hormones.","The Tyrogue line is undisputedly humanoid, sharing a similar morphology to humans.

Because they are so elusive, they are difficult subjects for scientists to research in the wild. No one is quite sure what Jynx conceal beneath their billowing “dresses”; they leave no footprints behind as they walk, though some believe that they may simply be using their psychic powers to levitate. Both Smoochum and Jynx have very thin skin that makes them susceptible to changes in atmospheric humidity. Their skin is particularly fragile around their lips, which also have a large number of nerve endings. ","The Elekid line are classified as primates, specifically as apes because of the lumbering body structure of Electivire. They share this trait with Darmanitan and Rillaboom, their fellow apes and closest relatives. Though primates have a reputation for being unusually intelligent, the Elekid line seems to display average intellect for Pokémon; the more agile primates, like Ambipom, Infernape, the Simi monkeys, and especially Oranguru fit this perception more than Electivire. Despite this, the ratio of their brain mass to body mass is noticeably larger than that of other Pokémon, a trait indicative of all species classified as primates.","The Magby line was an enigma to scientists; Magmar (the most common member of the lien in the wild) had a Psyduck’s bill but a Charmeleon’s tail, leading to some conclusion regarding its classification. Subsequent studies on the Pokémon along with its evolutions brought evidence that they were definitively reptilian, albeit with large deposits of adipose tissue that gave them their stocky builds. They share this trait with Lickilicky, who also confused researchers because of its odd body shape. Because of their curious behavior regarding volcanoes, scientists are looking into studying the behavior of Magby in order to predict volcanic eruptions.","Miltank are very close relatives of Tauros--so close, in fact, that many think that they are different genders of the same Pokémon. However, unlike counterparts like the Nidorans or Volbeat and Illumise, Miltank are unable to give birth to infant Tauros. Miltank were domesticated long ago in human history, bred for their incredibly nutritious milk. Societies with domestic Miltank could survive entirely on a diet their milk and agricultural crops. While they may have descended from the same recent ancestor, the relatively untamed Tauros is no longer considered the same species as Miltank, much as how Lillipup and other canid Pokémon are distinguished.","","","","","Tyranitar are the closest extant relatives of the extinct Tyrantrum. Although scientists aren’t sure if the two lived concurrently with one another, Tyranitar are definitely an ancient species of “living fossils.” Unlike other the pre-evolutions Pokémon that are exceptionally strong in their final forms, both Larvitar and Pupitar rarely are at the mercy of predators. Larvitar live so deep underground that they seldom encounter other Pokémon, while Pupitar have hard shells and can actually launch themselves violently to defend against attackers. These defenses in the line’s early stages of development likely contributed to its continued survival over the ages.","Tyranitar are the closest extant relatives of the extinct Tyrantrum.

Although scientists aren’t sure if the two lived concurrently with one another, Tyranitar are definitely an ancient species of “living fossils.” Unlike other the pre-evolutions Pokémon that are exceptionally strong in their final forms, both Larvitar and Pupitar rarely are at the mercy of predators.

The key to their  success is their incredible agility as well as climbing and leaping prowess. These Pokémon thrive best in dense forests, though they seem to prefer temperate climates over tropical ones. Sceptile are very rare in the wild, but are keystone species in their habitats. Scientists have noted that they fulfill a very similar niche in Hoenn forests as Venusaur do in Kanto ones, ensuring that their homes remain safe from danger. However, Venusaur try to maintain peace among Pokémon in their forests, while Sceptile ensure that the trees themselves thrive and flourish.","The Treecko family are squamates most closely related to Kecleon and Helioptile.

Torchic possess neither wings nor arms (much like Doduo, though it is more closely related to Pidove), but begin to develop fingers when they evolve into Combusken; sharp claws protrude from the feathers that cover the rest of the appendage. Blaziken shed these feathers entirely and possess hands that resemble the talons of other avians.

At first, they overlooked the limbs of these Pokémon and classified them as highly-diverged fish, having adapted hands and feet to push aside thick mud. This was mainly due to the fact that they possessed clear gills and did not breathe through their skin like most amphibians. However, many have now reversed this placement; it seems more likely that they developed specialized gill organs to breathe in muddy waters that would suffocate most other Pokémon. Regardless, this old classification has stuck and lived on in the line’s nickname as “the Mud Fish Pokémon.”","The amphibious Mudkip line has been an anomaly for taxonomists across the world.

Mightyena are a very interesting case of convergent evolution, however. In addition to sharing many physical features with canines, they hunt in packs with clear pecking orders more closely resembling Houndoom groups rather than the Luxray or Pyroar prides. Scientists hypothesize they may have evolved this way to specialize in hunting and scavenging prey on flat ground rather than in the trees.","It comes as a surprise to many that Mightyena is more closely related to felines like Persian than canines like Granbull.

Its closest extant relative is perhaps the Pokémon Spinda, even though it superficially resembles the likes of Furret or Floatzel. The family is of particular interest to some urban scientists because it seems to have not only persisted, but thrived in deforested areas turned into cities.

Scientists have never reached a consensus on its evolutionary heritage—avian, amphibious, mammalian, or botanical. They do agree, however, that its Pokémon ancestors had evolved symbiotically with the plants that grow along with them. The two organisms, floral and faunal, have become so mutually dependent that they are now a single Pokémon. The plant gradually grows from the head down through evolution to eventually cover the whole organism; their entire bodies are sheathed in pliant cellulose and shaggy “hair” that helps absorb damage from attacks.","Few people know what to make of Lotad and their evolutions.

Since Azurill themselves are unable to breed, researchers have ruled out reproductive benefits for such an adaptation. The current theory suggests that this occurrence may simply be due to a mutated sex allele in some female Azurill that would normally make them male but is not expressed until evolution.","The mysterious Pokémon have been closely studied for decades. They are almost sessile, moving very slowly and very rarely. The Rock-type Nosepass seem to actively require a large intake of magnetized iron in order to evolve into the partly Steel-type Probopass. Recent studies suggest that these Pokémon function almost like decomposers for Steel-type Pokémon; hundreds of Nosepass were found congregated around an abandoned mining site, having consumed almost all of the tools and materials in the area. They also have been observed feeding on the carcasses of deceased Steel-types near their homes.","Delcatty is part of the “small cat” group alongside Purugly and possibly Persian; these feline Pokémon, as their names suggest, are smaller than their “big cat” brethren.

Modern science has classified the species as a very unique relative of the primates, adapted to living in dark caves on a diet of rocks and minerals. The jewels encrusting their skin form as excess minerals are secreted from their bodies and crystallize over time. Researchers have no good theories explaining their odd movement, however. Their jittery twitching and glinting eyes make them seem wholly unnatural, so it is easy to see why some believe that they are unearthly beings.","These vaguely humanoid Pokémon are classified with other fae species like Ralts and Hatenna. Most people know Mawile for the huge, gaping jaw-like horns that jut out from their heads. These horns are metallic, but unusually light; studies show that their internal structure under a microscope resembles a honeycomb, giving them both stability and lightness. However, the “bite” force from these pseudo-jaws is one of the strongest known to man, capable of pulverizing stone and metal. The sharp spikes lining the lips of these horns function like teeth to hold onto prey and prevent their escape.","A member of the saurians, Aggron are the only extant ornithischians known today; its relatives Rampardos and Bastiodon both went extinct a hundred million years ago. Scientists believe that they survived because they had adapted to feed on inorganic material--iron--rather than plant matter.

Evolutionarily, they seem to have initially diverged to favor different food sources--Plusle can climb trees for food while Minun can forage on the ground, using their agility to evade predators. However, they have also evolved to work together in the wild. These Pokémon are still considered different species because they do not naturally mate with each other; Plusle mate with Plusle and Minun with Minun; however, only the females remains with their young, raising them with their opposite partner until they can fend for themselves. Young Plusle remain with their siblings while Minun venture out in search of Plusle.","Plusle and Minun are very close relatives of Raichu.

Much like the Nidoran family, Volbeat and Illumise are considered different Pokémon largely as a relic of past misconceptions; their morphological differences led the scientists who first discovered them to think they were different species, and the distinction has stuck even to this day. Volbeat displays are often seen as a hallmark of the summer season; they are also used as one of the first signs of water pollution. Since these Pokémon dislike dirty ponds and will migrate to new ones if their current ones are sullied, a summer without Volbeat displays is a warning of declining water quality.","These coleopterans are relatives of Ledian.

Its closest relative is Cherrim. These Pokémon are associated with grace and beauty, but also pain and poison. They are a favorite of poets and writers as symbols of this duality. Budew pollen is one of the most common allergens in both people and Pokémon, triggering seasonal attacks every spring. Because Budew are so numerous, their pollen can cause significant health issues when they open. However, because they are an important food source for larger Pokémon, efforts to control Budew populations have faced significant backlash.","These relatively simple Pokémon are really nothing more than giant stomachs in a jellylike-matrix of cells. They possess very primitive hearts, lungs, and eyes, but most of these organs are barely even functional. In the evolutionary tree, the Gulpin family diverges very close to its base as arguably one of the most primitive multi-cellular Pokémon. More recent studies have led scientists to hypothesize that Swalot in fact descended from a more “complex” Pokémon with complete organ systems; however, all but the digestive system withered away into vestigial remnants in order to maximize stomach capacity.","These relatively simple Pokémon are really nothing more than giant stomachs in a jellylike-matrix of cells.

Scientists have also tentatively placed Garchomp alongside these Pokémon as a terrestrial descendant; both species have been around for millions of years. Sharpedo are feared by people across the globe for their ferocity and brutality. This spurred some organizations to begin hunting them in an effort to curb their numbers. Some regions also treasure their fins as delicacies. Sharpedo play an important role in ocean ecosystems as apex predators, however, and such practices have been met with extreme resistance.","These fearsome Pokémon are cartilaginous fish; although they don’t resemble one another, Sharpedo and Mantine are in fact close relatives.

Wailord is famous for being the largest Pokémon known to man, but it is unusually light for its size. These Pokémon are coated in a thick layer of insulating blubber that is riddled with pockets of air; they can fill and empty these pockets with seawater to alter their density. Wailmer use this to bounce around on beaches, while Wailord expel and swallow water to leap into the air or dive deep into the ocean’s depths. These Pokémon were once hunted for their blubber, but declining numbers and demand have luckily slowed this practice.","These aquatic Pokémon are actually mammals; surprisingly, their closest extant relative is the desert-dwelling Hippowdon.

It is notable for its magma-storing humps, which are reinforced with modified bone that insulates the magma from outside air and prevents it from cooling. This bone is so good at insulation that these Pokémon can remain in temperate conditions for days before they run the risk of hardened lava. Much like a condiment squeeze bottle, repeated eruptions gradually cake Camerupt humps with dried lava until they nearly seal up. This forces gas to build up within them before finally exploding, much like a real volcano.","Camerupt is an artiodactyl, making it somewhat related to Sawsbuck and Stantler.

Contrary to popular belief, they are not related to Mamoswine, who in fact share more in common with the similarly-tusked Donphan. Spoink are famous for bouncing continuously, using this motion to pump blood through their bodies. This compensates for their unusually small hearts, which in turn enable them to possess very large brains for their size. Spoink collect the pearls that Clamperl discard when they evolve, an unusual practice that they ditch when they become Grumpig. When Spoink evolve, they also drop their pearls for future Spoink to pick up and use.","Grumpig are close relatives of Emboar, distinguished by their unique, elongated snouts.

No two Spinda have the same spot pattern. Scientists have concluded that Spinda patterns aren’t strongly based in genetics; the patterns of parent Spinda don’t seem to affect that of their offspring. Instead, the patterns appear to be created early on in embryonic development, though the mechanism is still unknown. These Pokémon are perhaps most famous for a recent news story in which a renowned researcher, having disappeared years ago, was found dancing drunkenly alongside a group of Spinda.","Trapinch and its evolutions are all insects, though Flygon may not look the part. They are part of their own unique order, but are more closely related to lepidopterans like Beautifly, Dustox, and Vivillon rather than Yanmega (despite Vibrava’s many similarities to it). This family undergoes some drastic changes during evolution, with Vibrava sprouting wings and Flygon heavily modifying its own exoskeleton, developing tiny plates that more closely resemble scales than a carapace. This design grants them much more flexibility while still shielding their bodies from harsh desert sands. ","Trapinch and its evolutions are all insects, though Flygon may not look the part.

Very well-adapted to life in dry deserts, these Pokémon can sustain themselves on very little water. They conserve as much energy as possible--Cacnea wait for prey to come to them, while Cacturne wait for the sweltering sun to set before hunting. Cacturne sap is very thick due to its low moisture content; when left to dry, it develops a gritty texture that likely spawned the myth of these Pokémon having sand for blood.","These cactus Pokémon are evidently very close relatives to Maractus; it comes as a surprise to many, though, that they are also relatives of carnivorous plant Pokémon like Victreebel and Tangrowth as well.

They are notable for their special, cottony feathers, which are spread so they can catch and trap air while these Pokémon are flying. They can also trap dirt and debris, however, so these Pokémon must carefully preen and rinse their wings before flight. This gives them their unique, pillowy texture and also helps them stay aloft among the clouds. Altaria’s Dragon-typing has also been subject to quite a bit of research recently. Scientists have postulated that it may have to do with a reactivated dormant gene passed on from the reptiles that all avian Pokémon descended from.","As passerines, Altaria is related to songbirds like Swellow and more distantly Chatot.

They are most famous for their intense, enduring rival with the Pokémon Seviper. Scientists aren’t sure why these Pokémon detest each other so much; neither preys on the other, and the two species will fight even when resources are abundant. Research strongly suggests that this rivalry is genetically inherited, so is is likely that it is a remnant of a period when Zangoose and Seviper did indeed either prey on one another or compete for resources. Zangoose have evolved a resistance to poisoning as a result of an evolutionary arms race with Seviper.","The serpentine Seviper are close relatives of Arbok and Serperior, though they lack the hollow fangs of the latter two Pokémon. They also distinguish themselves with a unique, accordion-like natural body posture. They often can be seen inching along the ground in this shape rather than slithering, though they will flatten their bodies to chase and constrict prey. These Pokémon are well-known for their bitter rivalry with the Pokémon Zangoose. As an adaptation to protect themselves against the sharp claws of their archenemies, these Pokémon can shed their skins and heal wounds rapidly. They are intelligent creatures known to work together to take down strong prey.","Lunatone and Solrock are both mysterious Pokémon that scientists don’t know much about. Although they share many similarities in composition and  habitat, they are tentatively thought to be different species because of their drastic contrast in physical appearance, abilities, and lifestyle. Most obviously, Lunatone are closely affiliated with the moon while Solrock are associated with the sun. Many strongly believe that these Pokémon have extraterrestrial origins, and while scientists have not been able to prove this, they have been unable to refute it as well; one supporting piece of evidence is that they contain many rare minerals commonly found in meteorites.","Lunatone and Solrock are both mysterious Pokémon that scientists don’t know much about.

These Pokémon share a rocky relationship with humans; on one hand, they can trigger large earthquakes that can cause mild structural damage in nearby buildings. On the other, Barboach (and even Whiscash for some more daring people) are very popular catches among freshwater fishermen; some anglers even opt to catch these slippery Pokémon by hand. Whiscash are one of the only pond Pokémon that can fend off wild Crawdaunt alone; this makes them important in protecting bodies of water from this overbearing species.","Whiscash is a ray-finned fish that is very closely related to Seaking as well as Gyarados; the latter even shares its characteristic barbs.

They are infamous for invading and taking over ponds, literally throwing out native species. Their hardiness and lack of natural predators have made them the most widespread invasive Pokémon in the world. Many conservation organizations have encouraged people to catch and eat wild Corphish, but even this practice has not made a significant dent in their numbers. It is illegal to release Corphish or Crawdaunt into any pond or lake other than ones specifically designated by the Pokémon League.","These arthropods are close relatives of Kingler and Crustle, adapted to life in brackish freshwater environments (though they can survive in streams and rivers as well).

They are strongly associated with ancient desert civilizations, with many believing that such ancient peoples may have even created them. They have many parallels with Sigilyph, another clay-based Pokémon that also inhabits desert ruins. Whether the two species were created by the same group of people or two coincidentally similar ideas is unknown. A sizable group of theorists believe that Baltoy and Claydol have extraterrestrial origins, purporting that their existence is evidence of alien life having visited and aided humanity some time in the past.","Claydol are very mysterious Pokémon that scientists currently know very little about.

However, they are actually relatives of the extant Starmie. Many also mistakenly believe that the sessile Lileep are plants, especially since they are Grass-types. They are thought to have been one of the most common Pokémon in warm oceans while they were alive, spreading themselves out on the sea floor to avoid competition but still remaining relatively close together. This is supported by the fact that Root Fossils are often found clumped together in large numbers. ","At a first glance, it may seem like these ancient, tentacled Pokémon are ancestors of the modern-day Tentacruel and Jellicent.

They are not only notable for being amphibious, but perhaps even more importantly because Anorith seem to have adapted to aquatic life from a terrestrial one. Their feathers actually appear to be modified feet; when they evolve into Armaldo, they regain their limbs and can walk on land once again. Modern scientists are still baffled by this phenomenon, but have hypothesized that being aquatic for some of their lifespan may have benefited Armaldo in energy efficiency.","Armaldo is thought to be closely related to some of the first arthropods, even more primitive than Kabutops (though Armaldo itself didn’t evolve until well after Kabutops went extinct).

While Gyarados represent atrocity and brutality, Milotic embody grace and beauty. While both are ray-finned fish, Gyarados is actually more closely related to Seaking or Whiscash than Milotic. Feebas are notorious for being difficult to find despite being both weak and abundant; this in turn makes Milotic even rarer catches. When a Feebas hotspot is found, fishermen and trainers will flock to it; eventually, the located school of Feebas will flee to another spot, forcing people to go searching once again.","Milotic are often seen as parallels to Gyarados; both are aquatic, serpentine Pokémon that evolve from much weaker pre-evolutions.

These Pokémon are sensitive to changes in the weather, changing form to suit surrounding conditions. Their molecules function similarly to water, but are uniquely locked into a neutral, solid state under normal conditions; in warm sunlight, they heat up into warm steam and cause Castform to assume their Sunny Forms. Upon contact with rainwater, they “release” themselves andflow freely in their Rainy Forms. In cold weather, they freeze up to enter their Snowy Forms.","Deceptive Kecleon are very close relatives of wily Inteleon. They are most famous for their color-changing abilities. This technique is made possible by chromatophores just beneath their skin, which can release varying amounts of different pigments to create different hues. The conspicuous red bands on their bellies lack these chromatophores; scientists aren’t sure why this is, but they have hypothesized that they may allow Kecleon to identify one another even when camouflaged. Their curious ability to change their own typings is also being intensely studied; it is likely that they have additional, chromatophore-like cells that grant them this ability.","Banette are thought to be spiritual Pokémon like Gengar or Mismagius contained within a cloth membrane. While scientists don’t know how these amorphous creatures are related, or if they are related at all, they do acknowledge that they share their fabric exteriors with the Pokémon Dusknoir. Banette are a major figure in urban legends and the contemporary horror genre, where they are portrayed as possessed children’s toys. These Pokémon star in two of the top ten horror films by box office success, including a major film from Unova’s Pokéstar Studios with a large cult following.","Banette are thought to be spiritual Pokémon like Gengar or Mismagius contained within a cloth membrane.

Dusknoir are thought to be relatives of Banette, with whom they share a similar, cloth-like membrane. Although many Ghost-types are associated with death, this family is uniquely associated with human spirits; some believe Dusknoir even receive orders from a higher power to take specific human souls to the spirit world at certain times.","These Pokémon are both feared and admired for their supernatural abilities.

They are characterized by the fruits that grow around their necks; this species is entirely responsible for the propagation of this fruit, eating and dispersing its seeds as they soar around. This plant has evolved to grow differently when exposed to certain chemical signals in Tropius; the leaves forming this Pokémon’s wings, for instance, form when this pathway is triggered. The undersides of their necks also fruit and disperse pollen; the pollen not only fertilizes the plants of other Tropius, but fertilizes normal fruit trees as well.","Chingling and Chimecho are known their musical capabilities; Chingling can produce a ringing jingle while Chimecho can make a beautiful, sparkling chime. Their ability to make noises like brass percussion instruments has led many to speculate that they may be related to Bronzong. These Pokémon have organic, fleshy appendages that Bronzong lack, however, and their resonating structures similarly seem natural in origin. Because Chimecho often appear in cemeteries, some believe that they may have some affiliation with the spirit world. It is said that their ethereal cries help soothe anguished souls and guide them to the land of the dead.","Absol are feliform hunters, relatives of their fellow Dark-type Mightyena. Their characteristic horns are made of keratin, which also composes their claws and tails. Much folklore surrounds these mysterious Pokémon, as many believe that their appearance will bring impending disaster. These Pokémon are very intelligent and capable of rational thought. Scientists are unsure why they continue to warn people of catastrophes even after they are blamed for them; however, they have discovered that Absol warn all life around them before disasters, not only humans. Other Pokémon seem to take their messages seriously, fleeing the area when Absol appear.","Wynaut and Wobbuffet seem to be very primitive Pokémon evolution-wise. Despite their upright statures, they are invertebrates. Research strongly suggests that their true brains--and most vital organs, for that matter--lie in their tails; the blue structures once thought to be their bodies are in fact elaborate decoys. A rudimentary set of nerves, cartilage, and an esophagus allow them to move, eat, and vocalize; however, the bulk of both systems lies in their tails. Though the tails can survive without their decoys, they to lose their countering abilities and become helpless if separated. They seem to be capable of immobilizing foes with strong psychic powers if threatened.","These icy Pokémon can inhabit even the coldest areas of the world. Because they are rarely sighted, many cultures have different pieces of folklore surrounding each of these Pokémon. Alpine communities associate Snorunt with snow and good fortune, for instance, and warn travelers of the mysterious Froslass. Scientists have hypothesized that Snorunt may have originally been a cave-dwelling Rock-type that adapted to the frozen caverns. This is primarily supported by the fact that Glalie are composed mostly of rock, despite being Ice-types. Recent studies also show that Froslass have rocky cores supporting them as well.","These icy Pokémon can inhabit even the coldest areas of the world.

Clamperl shells are an example of convergent evolution with Cloyster; their structure and how they are attached to their bodies differ radically from true bivalves. Distinguished by their lack of pelvic fins, scientists are still trying to learn more about elusive Huntail and Gorebyss.

Thus, these Pokémon in a sense are more like ancestors of modern amphibians, reptiles, and mammals rather than other fish. These “living fossils” were alive alongside more traditional fossil Pokémon like Lileep and Anorith; in fact, Relicanth fossils are sometimes found alongside Root and Claw Fossils. The discovery of Relicanth fueled many conspiracy theories purporting that other ancient Pokémon, thought to be long-extinct, may still be inhabiting the deepest reaches of our oceans. These theories have yet to be proven, however.","Luvdisc are ray-finned fishes notable for their odd body shape; they lack any fins whatsoever, giving them their distinct heart-shaped bodies. Though some believe they are related to Alomomola, the latter species are actually closer relatives of Qwilfish. Luvdisc are a valuable food source for tropical Pokémon; they school in large numbers and pose virtually no threat to predators. Though they are often seen as symbols of love, and their scales are coveted by collectors, these Pokémon are also infamous for being very poor in battle. Some even believe that the tradition of lovers gifting each other Luvdisc began as a way for fishermen to pawn off these weak Pokémon.","Salamence are often seen as the archetypical member of the group Draconidae--winged, reptilian, and capable of breathing fire. They are related to Charizard and Hydreigon. Bagon are famous for their burning desire to fly; scientists believe this innate longing encourages them to seek out the cliffs and ledges that will suit them well upon evolution, as Salamence lay their eggs deep within caverns where there is little room to fly. Popular culture purports that it is this desire that causes them to sprout wings upon evolution, though there is little science supporting this notion. Salamence are a popular figure in Kalosian folklore, appearing in opposition to medieval heroes.","Salamence are often seen as the archetypical member of the group Draconidae--winged, reptilian, and capable of breathing fire.

While Beldum are of average intelligence for Psychic-types, their capacity for analyzation doubles and then quadruples as they evolve into Metang and then Metagross, respectively. This family is valued in the studies of math and science, as they can run difficult calculations and even employ multistep algorithms to further streamline their deductions. These Pokémon are also notable for developing circulatory systems much like those of organic Pokémon, except they use magnetism to transport metal ions rather than blood to transport nutrients. ","These inorganic Pokémon are lauded for their incredible intellect.

They are famous for having earthy shells capable of supporting abundant plant life. These shells are kept moist and fertile as Torterra drink water and digest plant matter. Torterra can support miniature ecosystems on their backs, with small, weak Pokémon finding shelter on them. Avian Pokémon like Starly are even known to nest on their backs. Torterra seem to support whatever flora naturally grows near them; oddly, though, their shells seem unusually receptive to tree and shrub growth and resistant to weeds. Scientists hypothesize that these Pokémon may produce a mild herbicide to foster this.","Torterra are terrestrial chelonians, making them close relatives of Torkoal.

They are very closely related to the simian trio—Simisage, Simisear, and Simipour. Though they both share the Fire-typing, Simisear and Infernape appear to have evolved this elemental affinity separately. The Chimchar line is well-known for its agility, playfulness, and intelligence. Infernape is a popular character in both traditional and modern stories; one of the most famous pieces of ancient Sinnoh folklore centers around a great Infernape who uses his cunning and combat skills to overcome a number of difficult obstacles along his journey.","Infernape are a part of the primate order.

They are heavily adapted to life in polar seas, with insulating down and hard flippers that can break apart ice floes. As a tradeoff, though, Empoleon has also lost its capability of flight, and they are one of the few avians that lack the Flying-type. The horns on their heads are sometimes used as symbols of power; a notable travel gear company uses the design as their logo, for instance.","","","Staraptor is a traditional bird of prey, representing the virtue of strength. Indeed, it and Braviary are the two most powerful of the group; Braviary are also Staraptor’s closest relatives. Staraptor are famous for the flamboyant combs of feathers on their heads, which are symbols of strength in popular culture. Starly are perhaps the most prolific avian known to science. They flock in staggering numbers and can thrive even in human cities. Scientists are currently studying whether Starly populations are still growing, and if their numbers have impacted the well-being of other Pokémon species.","Staraptor is a traditional bird of prey, representing the virtue of strength.

They are famed for their industrial natures and dam-building abilities. Bibarel are a keystone species in the regions that they inhabit, altering the flow of rivers with their dams. Both people and Pokémon alike rely on the environments create. Modern dams and levees are actually built with significant influence from Bibarel dams, sometimes even with the aid of the Pokémon themselves. In the past, Bidoof used to be a prime target for poachers for their fur. Such hunting had a huge ecological impact on the environment, which eventually led to its outlawing.","Bibarel are rodents, sharing their characteristic growing incisors with Pokémon like Raticate and Cinccino.

They are most well-known for their musical capabilities; Kricketot can clang their antennae together to produce a xylophone-like sound, while Kricketune can sing beautifully and resonate their voices within their own bodies. These Pokémon are a favorite of composers, who are enamored with their improvisational skills, as well as conductors, who can teach them to lead human symphonies in addition to Kricketot ones.

They each also serve as apex predators in their respective domains. Other than typing, they primarily differ in habitats, with Luxray living in temperate grasslands and Pyroar dwelling in dry ones. They also differ in how they delegate roles amongst sexes; Luxray are not distinguished by gender, sharing their jobs interchangeably.

Its closest relative is Cherrim. These Pokémon are associated with grace and beauty, but also pain and poison. They are a favorite of poets and writers as symbols of this duality. Budew pollen is one of the most common allergens in both people and Pokémon, triggering seasonal attacks every spring. Because Budew are so numerous, their pollen can cause significant health issues when they open. However, because they are an important food source for larger Pokémon, efforts to control Budew populations have faced significant backlash.","The Budew family is a rosid; the clade even derives its name from Roselia and Roserade.

The other member of this order is Bastiodon; while they used their head plates for defense, though, Rampardos used their skulls for offense. Rampardos are often portrayed in popular media as dim-witted, a stereotype that actually seems to have been proven true. These Pokémon have very small brains as a trade-off for their thick skulls. Because fossil records show that their ancestors actually had larger brains, scientists believe Rampardos actually evolved smaller brains due to lack of evolutionary pressure for intelligence.","Rampardos are part of a saurian group known as the ornithischians, distinguished by the bony horns and plates that protect their heads.

They are one of the first Pokémon people think of when they picture a herbivorous saurian—large, docile, and slow-moving. They epitomize the idea that the best offense is a good defense; their instinctual response to a threat is to line up and face it headfirst. Scientists believe that Bastiodon encouraged predators to develop one of two tactics: intelligence or flight. Smarter predators could find ways to disperse their walls to access their vulnerable offspring, while aerial ones could easily pass over their fortresses. Tyrantrum, for example, was thought to have been smart enough to outwit these Pokémon.","Bastiodon are ornithischians alongside Rampardos.

While Pineco restrict themselves to tree bark and rarely shed their cloaks, though, Burmy use a wide variety of materials and routinely lose their coverings. This family is also notable for its odd sexual dimorphism; females are neotenous like Forretress, never sprouting wings to fly like males.

Instead of possessing venom and stingers to defend themselves, though, Vespiquen rely on a unique, eusocial colony structure that utilizes Combee to attack and protect. Since male Combee cannot evolve, their entire lives are dedicated to protecting their queens; female Combee are usually suppressed by the queen’s pheromones, but errant evolutions rarely occur. The hexagonal shape of a Combee unit is of great interest to architects, as it provides great stability and impermeability to Combee hives. Combee also produce delicious Honey; modern Honey is usually produced in artificial hives with the help of Combee keepers.","Vespiquen are close relatives of Beedrill.

They are most closely related to Emolga, with whom they share many of their physiological characteristics. While Emolga have become clumsy on the ground in favor of aerial mobility, though, Pachirisu remain capable of agilely scurrying from one place to the next. They are also notable for how they have weaponized their own shed hair, electrifying it and fashioning it into balls to protect their food caches. This actually seems to be a behavior they learn from watching other Pachirisu, as individuals raised alone in captivity never replicate this practice.","These aquatic mustelids can be distinguished by their overhanging canines, a trait that they share with the closely-related Weavile. Though they share some characteristics with Samurott, these similarities arose separately as they adapted to similar environments (Samurott, who are pinnipeds like Walrein, adapted to coastal beaches while Floatzel evolved to thrive in freshwater rivers). Their flotation sacs are also notable adaptations, functioning like external swim bladders of sorts. The oil-filled tails of mammalian Azumarill serve a similar purpose in another interesting example of this trait.","These aquatic mustelids can be distinguished by their overhanging canines, a trait that they share with the closely-related Weavile.

Unlike their cousins, this family can bear fruit in the form of the withered secondary heads of Cherubi. In the past, harvesting this fruit was  a tedious and ethically controversial practice, as Cherubi need them for nutrients and usually only ever produced a single one. Modern feeding and nutritional practices, however, allow Cherubi to thrive without their secondary heads and even produce new ones. Cherrim have optimized sunlight exposure to an extreme extent; while many Grass-types become more active in the sun, Cherrim actually enter a state similar to hibernation as soon as they enter the shade.","As rosids, Cherrim’s closest extant relative is Roserade.

They are notable for their distinct East and West Sea forms, which arose after Mt. Coronet in Sinnoh divided the population in two. Though they have traditionally been thought to have arose through allopatric speciation, with each side adapting to its environment, it has been recently proposed that the peak divided the population very unequally; the side with only a few individuals would have any unique traits already present quickly spread through the founder effect. This better explains the changes in traits like their back growths, which seem to have little effect on their survival.","Gastrodon, as their name suggests, are gastropods, making them relatives of Goodra.

Possessing large brains and the ability to use tools (such as sharpened sticks for piercing the rinds of fruit), Aipom are popular in media as playful, cunning (but not malicious) tricksters. Both Aipom and Ambipom have evolved tails that function much like hands, complete with finger-like appendages. Their hands have atrophied in vestigial remnants over time; they likely evolved this way because of how they spend their lives swinging in trees by their tails. Similarly, their feet are also not well-suited for walking, though not as weak as their hands.","Little is known about these mysterious Pokémon; tracking wild Drifblim seems to be a fruitless task, as GPS trackers and other devices inexplicably cease signaling when the Pokémon disappear from view. Believers of the supernatural purport that Drifblim make periodic trips to the underworld to feed, explaining why they suddenly vanish and never seem to eat. From a more scientific viewpoint, these odd creatures seem to function much like Tentacool do in the ocean; both have soft bodies composed primarily of the surrounding medium, and both drift about aimlessly in currents with little control of their movement.","Little is known about these mysterious Pokémon; tracking wild Drifblim seems to be a fruitless task, as GPS trackers and other devices inexplicably cease signaling when the Pokémon disappear from view.

Though Diggersby are more advanced in this regard, Lopunny are far more agile creatures. Lopunny have some of the strongest legs for Pokémon of similar size, using them to both leap about as well as kick down foes who stand in their way. Lopunny fur is a common material in the fashion industry, with many boutiques championing it as luxuriously elegant and sophisticated. Since these Pokémon only shed twice a year, however, it is also far pricier than the similar Mareep wool.","Lopunny is a very close relative of Diggersby; both Pokémon have highly developed ears that can be somewhat maneuvered to complete various tasks.

They, however, are tangible (unlike their fellow Ghost-type, Gengar). While most other Ghost-types either have membranes or material bodies, Mismagius lack any sort of protective covering; their bodies billow like smoke as they travel, held together by some currently unknown force. Their ability to seemingly materialize and disappear at will makes them difficult to study in the wild. These Pokémon are also related to Mimikyu, Drifblim, and Banette, the last of which with whom they share their typing, body composition, and diet; Banette are characterized by their distinct, cloth bodies, however.","Honchkrow are passerines related to Fearow and Swellow; most significantly, they are also in the same genus as Corviknight. They are largely nocturnal, but can be found active during the day in dark places. These Pokémon are well known for their unique social structure, in which flocks of Murkrow “henchmen” serve a single Honchkrow boss, defending the territory as well as bringing back food and shiny loot. Why exactly they are so fascinated with reflective objects is unknown, but scientists theorize that Honchkrow gauge the sizes of their rivals’ hoards in order to judge their might. Thus, they may attempt to create large collections of shiny objects in order to assert their dominance against rival Honchkrow with smaller piles.","These felines are part of the “small cats” group, alongside Persian and Delcatty. While they are adored by some and kept as pets like their cousins, they are by far the most polarizing member of the group when it come to public perception. Unlike scrappy Meowth or adorable Skitty, people that dislike Glameow often fail to find any positive qualities that would justify their adoration (even devious Purrloin are arguably less overtly troublesome). Because stray Purugly can be huge nuisances when they enter homes or the nests of wild Pokémon, some cities have banned these Pokémon as pets altogether.","These felines are part of the “small cats” group, alongside Persian and Delcatty.

Their ability to make noises like brass percussion instruments has led many to speculate that they may be related to Bronzong. These Pokémon have organic, fleshy appendages that Bronzong lack, however, and their resonating structures similarly seem natural in origin. Because Chimecho often appear in cemeteries, some believe that they may have some affiliation with the spirit world. It is said that their ethereal cries help soothe anguished souls and guide them to the land of the dead.","Although Skuntank are related to mustelids like Weavile and Floatzel, they actually are the sole members of their own family entirely. These Pokémon are famous for their putrid scent glands, which they use to deter predators. The compound they produce is rich in odorous sulfur and can last for a long time before dissipating. These Pokémon also are oddly resistant to the attacks of Combee and Vespiquen thanks to their thick fur and skin; Skuntank have been known to ignite their sprays to break apart walls of Combee and access valuable Honey. This behavior is believed to be learned, not instinctual, as orphaned Stunky rarely practice this technique.","Although Skuntank are related to mustelids like Weavile and Floatzel, they actually are the sole members of their own family entirely.

Since Bronzong resonate sound much like Chimecho, some hypothesize that the two may be related in some way. Much of what we know about these Pokémon actually comes from archaeologists and anthropologists, who have uncovered ancient tools and artwork that hint at their connection to weather and agriculture.","Little is known about these mysterious Pokémon; while we know that they have been around for thousands of years, modern scientists have only discovered them less than a century ago (the Bronzor-like implements were discovered initially, followed by the first Bronzong and then Bronzor themselves).

The line is notable for providing strong evidence supporting a common origin for inorganic and organic Pokémon; unlike Pokémon like Electrode or Klinklang, scientists agree that Sudowoodo’s camouflage was adapted over time through natural selection and speciation. As one of the only inorganic Pokémon found outside of an environment composed primarily of what they themselves are made of (in other words, as Rock-types found outside of rocky areas), this adaptation showed that they could evolve over time instead of spontaneously forming from their basic elements.","Many people find Mr. Mime to be deeply unsettling because of how humanoid, but not quite human, they look. Researchers agree that they are likely the closest link between people and Pokémon, citing support such as: their similar physiology, their great intellect, their affinities for towns and cities, their distinctly human-like skin, and their near-identical brain structures. The physical differences between people and Mr. Mime can largely be attributed to two primary differences. Firstly, these Pokémon store fat entirely in their torsos, giving them very slender limbs. Secondly, their joints are all synovial, allowing them to bend at odd, sometimes disturbing angles.","The Happiny family is the one of two known extant lines of an order of mammals known as monotremes, alongside Golduck. This group is unique in that, unlike all other mammals, its members lay eggs instead of giving birth to live young under normal environmental conditions (all Pokémon that can reproduce in captivity will do so via eggs, a basal trait activated when normal mating conditions are not fulfilled). These Pokémon will lay sterile eggs even when not mating; these eggs are famously delicious and high in nutrients. The behavior of wild individuals has not been well-studied, as these Pokémon are rarely sighted and are quick to flee.","While many passerines like Chatot are skilled when it comes to vocalization (Altaria readily comes to mind), these Pokémon are by far the most advanced, both in complexity and variety. Their chattering has evolved to be their primary form of hunting, disguise, and defense. Because they can imitate any instrument, these Pokémon are popular in bands; they are especially common in schools, where budget constraints make such a flexible Pokémon very valuable in music programs. Chatot are thought to be one of the most intelligent avians; while perhaps not comparable to Noctowl or Xatu, they are very bright when it comes to memorization and problem-solving.","These mysterious Pokémon are feared by many; Sinnoh mythology claims that each Spiritomb is composed of 108 malevolent souls confined to an earthly keystone and prevented from passage to the spirit world because of their wrongdoings. Naturally, scientists are skeptical of this theory, as it doesn’t explain why Spiritomb and keystones continue to appear in the wild even as known individuals are caught. Believers in the paranormal, however, point to a peculiar inter-Pokémon interaction to support their beliefs; the Pokémon Dusknoir, said to ferry spirits to the underworld, seem to instinctively attack Spiritomb on sight, even if they have never seen one before.","Garchomp are thought to share a common ancestor with the modern Sharpedo; though terrestrial and limbed, they do in fact have similarly-arranged scales, modified fins, and most importantly, cartilaginous skeletons. Members of the Gible line also shed their teeth periodically, much like Sharpedo. Fossils of what most scientists agree are likely the remnants of “proto-Gible” were also found in areas that would have bordered tropical seas in the past, further supporting this hypothesis. It is unknown why these Pokémon today dwell in hot, dry areas; though they may have left the water to hunt terrestrial prey, exactly why they abandoned the tropics remains a mystery.","Garchomp are thought to share a common ancestor with the modern Sharpedo; though terrestrial and limbed, they do in fact have similarly-arranged scales, modified fins, and most importantly, cartilaginous skeletons.

However, from skeletal and physiological examinations, it is clear that these Pokémon are ursines, related to the likes of Ursaring and Beartic. It is notable that the members of this family hibernate, sleeping throughout the winter while living off of energy reserves gathered prior to their dormancy. Many scientists believe that the lengthy sleeping and eating patterns of Snorlax is the result of the trigger for their hibernation somehow being left perpetually in the “on” position.","Evolutionarily speaking, Lucario seem to be highly-diverged canids, most closely related to Houndoom. While distinctly bipedal, they do share similar snouts, teeth (though they have curved canines), and ears with other canids. These Pokémon are famous for their ability to harness and detect “aura;” the only other species known to utilize it with any regularity is Medicham. Like the other nebulous forms of energy that Pokémon use, little is known about aura and how it functions. Scientists do know that it functions much like a wave of light or sound, strong “pulses” of it can travel far distances, but the resting aura of most beings only envelops their own bodies. ","Evolutionarily speaking, Lucario seem to be highly-diverged canids, most closely related to Houndoom.

Fossil evidence suggests that the ancestors of Hippowdon were actually semiaquatic. This makes them similar to Krookodile (and to a lesser extent Garchomp) in that they are both desert dwellers that descended from water-based ancestors. Exactly why these Pokémon evolved to not only become terrestrial, but also adapted to life in arid, sandy environments, is still unknown.","Though scientists once believed that these Pokémon were related to Grumpig and Emboar, modern research shows that they are actually and surprisingly closest to Wailord (though they are still even-toed ungulates like the aforementioned species).

They are very closely related to Gliscor, and more distantly to Sizzlipede; though they cannot fly like Gliscor, they share very similar venom (close enough to be treated by the same antivenom, in fact). These Pokémon are notable for being able to survive both in arid deserts and moist wetlands. They are able to regulate their water levels very precisely, allowing them to conserve moisture in dry areas or expel it in wet ones. In fact, scientists speculate that Drapion may have very recently descended from an aquatic ancestor, though they aren’t sure whether Gliscor shares this ancestor as well.","Drapion are arachnids.

They are notable for their virulent poison; another one of their relatives, Seismitoad, also can secrete a paralyzing poison, but the two seem to have developed this separately. Toxicroak also churn their poison in their sacs to increase its potency by mixing volatile chemicals; scientists note that the Pokémon Weezing practice this as well, though with gases rather than fluids. It is thought that these Pokémon derive most—though not all—of their toxicity from their diets; trained individuals raised on nontoxic diets are significantly less poisonous than their wild brethren.","Toxicroak are anurans, with their closest relatives being the Poliwag family and Greninja.

Though they may utilize different mechanisms to trap their prey, both adapted to nutrient-poor environments by developing the ability to hunt. They also utilize the same aromatic compound in their drool (Carnivine) or acid (Victreebel) to attract victims towards them. Carnivine differ from their close relative a bit in that they also can tolerate temperate climates as well, whereas Victreebel are a primarily tropical species. Carnivine are also solitary Pokémon, while Victreebel dwell in huge colonies.","Lumineon are perciformes with an interesting choice of habitat; Finneon spend their days in sunlit coral reefs before returning to the depths of the ocean at night, while Lumineon wander along the sea floor on their fins. Their main competition for food is Lanturn, who are also bioluminescent deep-sea dwellers. Without the electrogenetic capabilities that Lanturn have, however, Lumineon seem to be at an immediate disadvantage. Scientists believe that these Pokémon evolved to trawl the very bottom of the sea to avoid direct conflict with Lanturn, as they have settled for whatever scraps have floated down from the ocean’s surface.","Lumineon are perciformes with an interesting choice of habitat; Finneon spend their days in sunlit coral reefs before returning to the depths of the ocean at night, while Lumineon wander along the sea floor on their fins.

These gentle giants are famous for their mutualistic relationship with the much smaller Remoraid. In fact, the two have coevolved to depend upon one another for survival. Mantyke are large baby Pokémon that are easy targets for predators, so they will swim alongside schools of Remoraid for protection; conversely, Remoraid are eager to latch onto Mantyke once they grow large enough for easy food and travel until they evolve. In fact, the successful attachment of a Remoraid to a Mantyke triggers the latter’s evolution into Mantine.","These elusive Pokémon are the only gymnosperms we know of so far. While Snover can be rarely spotted in the winter when they migrate to lower altitudes, Abomasnow are practically never seen in the wild; the vast majority of sighting reports involve blurry, indistinct silhouettes shrouded in furious blizzards. These Pokémon are thought to share a connection with snow flowers, one of the few plants that can tolerate constant snow. However, some scientists suggest that this relation may only be coincidental; it is possible that the snow flower blooming season may simply coincide with Abomasnow mating season, for instance.","These elusive Pokémon are the only gymnosperms we know of so far.

They are adapted to snowy environments, particularly boreal forests. However, they are more tolerant of heat than most Ice-types. One of their most curious adaptations are the feather-like appendages that sprout on their heads and tails. They were once proposed to determine the ranking of members in a pack, but research shows that such rankings don’t exist in their packs. The leading theory now points to them being an indicator of sexual fitness; it should be noted that female Sneasel have shorter “feathers” than male ones.","Magnezone are inorganic Pokémon that have metal-based bodies rather than carbon-based ones. This puts them in the same group as Pokémon like Klingklang and Bronzong. Since they are inorganic, exactly where they fall in the classification system is uncertain. In systems where all Pokémon, both carbon-based and non-carbon-based, are placed in the same kingdom, they are either classified alongside Electrode on the grounds of their shared electrogenesis abilities, or with Metagross based on their shared electromagnetic abilities. Of course, there is also the very plausible possibility that one or more of these Pokémon arose independently of the others.","The Lickitung family was traditionally classified as a mammal due to its general body physiology. Though some scientists speculated that they were perhaps amphibious or reptilian because of their long tongues, few bothered to conduct much research on them; the line has up until recently been woefully neglected by researchers for unknown reasons. Newer studies strongly suggest that they are in fact reptilian, however. Their skulls are clearly diapsid in nature, a distinctly reptilian trait (in addition to their tongues and tails). Their mammalian physiques likely result from their copious adipose tissue, a trait they oddly share with fellow pudgy squamatan Magmortar.","The Rhyhorn family are classic examples of ungulates, particularly of perissodactyls like Hypno, Zebstrika, and Rapidash. Alongside Drowzee, Mareep, and Tepig (as well as potentially Spoink, though because of its unique form of locomotion this is debatable), Rhyhorn are among the minority of ungulates that become bipedal upon evolution; this chance in stance also comes with an increase in intelligence, a trend observed across multiple orders of Pokémon. Their characteristically thick and sturdy armor evolved to protect these sluggish, large herbivores from predators, much like the skin of their relative Donphan.","It is difficult to classify the Tangela line because no one has figured out what lies beneath the masses of vines that cover the Pokémon. From research done on vines that have snapped off of these Pokémon, it appears that they share an evolutionary relationship with seaweed and other forms of algae. However, DNA evidence also has revealed unexpressed genes that are identical to that of flowering plants, with similarities far closer than they share with algae. For this reason, despite carrying traits with both groups, they are classified as asterids alongside other flowering Pokémon like Sunflora; more research needs to be conducted in order to cement this placing.","The Elekid line are classified as primates, specifically as apes because of the lumbering body structure of Electivire. They share this trait with Darmanitan and Rillaboom, their fellow apes and closest relatives. Though primates have a reputation for being unusually intelligent, the Elekid line seems to display average intellect for Pokémon; the more agile primates, like Ambipom, Infernape, the Simi monkeys, and especially Oranguru fit this perception more than Electivire. Despite this, the ratio of their brain mass to body mass is noticeably larger than that of other Pokémon, a trait indicative of all species classified as primates.","The Magby line was an enigma to scientists; Magmar (the most common member of the lien in the wild) had a Psyduck’s bill but a Charmeleon’s tail, leading to some conclusion regarding its classification. Subsequent studies on the Pokémon along with its evolutions brought evidence that they were definitively reptilian, albeit with large deposits of adipose tissue that gave them their stocky builds. They share this trait with Lickilicky, who also confused researchers because of its odd body shape. Because of their curious behavior regarding volcanoes, scientists are looking into studying the behavior of Magby in order to predict volcanic eruptions.","Togekiss are thought to be a relatively primitive species of birds, notably lacking the talons present in the vast majority of other species. Their thick layers of feathers and adipose tissues give them their distinctively plump shape. Togepi have been intensely researched in order to learn more about maternal imprinting, particularly for applications in the upbringings of other children and young Pokémon. Meanwhile, Togetic’s joy dust is being tested for use as an antidepressant. Togekiss are heralded as symbols of world peace and have historically been a common mascot of many nonviolent protest organizations.","The Yanma line is thought to be a very ancient family of Pokémon, even when compared to fellow arthropods. Yanmega are thought to be living fossils that have changed little from millions of years ago. As menacing as they are today, some of the line’s now-extinct relatives are thought to have been even larger than Yanmega. It is thought that a decrease in available atmospheric oxygen prevented these relatives from thriving, allowing the “smaller” Yanmega to proliferate. These Pokémon are notable for their unique, elongated body plan, their blistering speed, and their ability to hover in the air. ","Eevee are related to vulpines like Ninetales and Zoroark; some scientists even believe that they were even bred from the common ancestor of these Pokémon. Their unstable DNA is thought to have been a byproduct of generations of inbreeding to select traits desirable in a pet. Though all Eeveelutions are adapted to a different environment, they all are exceedingly rare in the wild, and are adapted to life alongside people. It is notable that two of them (Espeon and Umbreon), evolve based on developing trust between themselves and their trainers, while a third (Sylveon), evolves based on creating a strong emotional bond.","Eevee are related to vulpines like Ninetales and Zoroark; some scientists even believe that they were even bred from the common ancestor of these Pokémon.

Rather than possessing wings, they have membranes that allow them to glide (in the case of Gligar) or fly (Gliscor) through the air. As arachnids, they are very closely related to Drapion; both possess pincers and stingers, although their positions are reversed from one another. The two Pokémon have very similar venoms, and can in fact be treated with the same antivenom. In the past, many believed that these Pokémon were hematophagous like the similar-looking Golbat. However, despite their appearances, the Pokémon are unrelated, and Gliscor have not been ever reported to suck blood.","There is some debate as to whether these ancient Pokémon are more closely related to the modern Donphan or Emboar. Though they have been traditionally classified with the former due to their quadrupedal nature and possession of tusks, many scientists today believe that they are much more closely related to the latter, primarily citing their physiology and short snouts. Mamoswine are famously prehistoric, most notably with one individual being successfully thawed from ice after being frozen for thousands of years. While Swinub and Piloswine can be found in a number of snowy areas, Mamoswine only inhabit the most frozen glaciers of the world.","Silph Co. created the first artificial Pokémon, Porygon, in the late 1990s, and issued its upgrade, Porygon2, at the turn of the century. Porygon-Z was an unauthorized update created by an unknown group of hackers. Some people believe that Team Galactic created the patch while perfecting interdimensional travel, while others think that Team Plasma scientist Colress covertly created Porygon-Z at the P2 Laboratory in Unova. Though owning a Porygon-Z is technically illegal, the Pokémon has become so famous (including a starring role in a popular video game as a corrupt research facility AI) that Silph Co. has ceased taking action against its owners.","For scientists that believed Pokémon and people share a common ancestor, the humanoid Ralts line was thought to be one of humanity’s closest relatives. However, recent studies have proposed a new division that instead includes them in the novel Fascinus. Ralts and its evolutions are very popular Pokémon, but are also famously difficult to raise; it is said training a Ralts is more akin to raising a child a Pokémon. This also makes the line one of the most controversial in the debate of Pokémon training ethics; they are clearly able to think and feel emotions like people, yet can be caught like any other Pokémon. On the other hand, they also thrive best alongside a compassionate human, and can easily evade capture if they choose to do so.","The mysterious Pokémon have been closely studied for decades. They are almost sessile, moving very slowly and very rarely. The Rock-type Nosepass seem to actively require a large intake of magnetized iron in order to evolve into the partly Steel-type Probopass. Recent studies suggest that these Pokémon function almost like decomposers for Steel-type Pokémon; hundreds of Nosepass were found congregated around an abandoned mining site, having consumed almost all of the tools and materials in the area. They also have been observed feeding on the carcasses of deceased Steel-types near their homes.","These Pokémon are both feared and admired for their supernatural abilities. Parents often warn their children that Duskull will kidnap them if they misbehave; Dusclops are said to send those that gaze into their eyes into purgatory; Dusknoir are thought to ferry pure souls to the land of the dead. Dusknoir are thought to be relatives of Banette, with whom they share a similar, cloth-like membrane. Although many Ghost-types are associated with death, this family is uniquely associated with human spirits; some believe Dusknoir even receive orders from a higher power to take specific human souls to the spirit world at certain times.","These icy Pokémon can inhabit even the coldest areas of the world. Because they are rarely sighted, many cultures have different pieces of folklore surrounding each of these Pokémon. Alpine communities associate Snorunt with snow and good fortune, for instance, and warn travelers of the mysterious Froslass. Scientists have hypothesized that Snorunt may have originally been a cave-dwelling Rock-type that adapted to the frozen caverns. This is primarily supported by the fact that Glalie are composed mostly of rock, despite being Ice-types. Recent studies also show that Froslass have rocky cores supporting them as well.","Rotom are an odd Pokémon; unique amongst spectral species, they have developed the ability to not only generate their own electricity, but possess electrical devices and control them as well. Their bodies are much like plasma, though not nearly as hot. Many scientists believe that Rotom are almost entirely composed of electrical energy, bound together by the same, mysterious attractive force that holds Pokémon like Gastly intact. For reasons unknown, Rotom seem to crave human attention more than anything else; they will desperately seek people when left alone, attempting escape from enclosures by any means possible.","","","","","","","","","","Phione are an odd Pokémon when it comes to classification; according to myth, all Phione are descendants of the legendary Pokémon Manaphy, which to some (including most Sinnoh residents) means that they themselves are legendaries. In all other aspects, however, Phione are essentially a normal species; they reproduce on their own to produce more Phione, for instance. Scientists believe that the mythical Manaphy is likely a lone mutation that resulted in a phenotypically-different Phione that could nevertheless breed to produce normal offspring. Phylogenically, these Pokémon, with their soft bodies and lack of skeletons, are gastropods like Gastrodon.","","","","","","With their slender bodies and hollow fangs, these serpents are close relatives of Arbok. Curiously, while Snivy possess clear arms and legs, these limbs shrink upon their evolution into Servine and then practically disappear entirely when they become Serperior. Popular folklore says that these Pokémon lost their limbs as punishment for their arrogance. Scientists believe, however, that Snivy have arms and legs to compensate for only having a single leaf for photosynthesis; they are the most likely stage to have to pick fruits and Berries to survive. Once they evolve and grow more leaves, these limbs become useless, as Servine and Serperior can live entirely off of sunlight.","With their slender bodies and hollow fangs, these serpents are close relatives of Arbok.

While many Fire-types possess some sort of internal organ that produces or contains fire, Emboar are unique in how they store fuel for their flames. Much of the food that they eat is stored as fat, which builds up around their bodies. They then burn these lipids as fuel for their attacks; the fat also helps keep these Pokémon insulated during cold weather. As a trade-off for this, however, Emboar have to eat near-constantly in order to maintain a steady supply of fuel; if they burn off too much, they will be left both fire-less and unprotected from the cold.","Emboar are related to Grumpig; both are artiodactyls, specifically swines.

Though they aren’t tusked like their relatives, they wield similarly-sharp, shell-like implements like weapons. Oshawott and Dewott use scalchops while Samurott hold seamitars. These Pokémon grow their implements as they develop on special patches of skin, much like they grow their own teeth and claws. Once “ready,” the weapons can be snapped off at specific, brittle locations and sharpened on nearby boulders. Both scalchops and seamitars take a very long time to regrow, however, so they are protected very fiercely.","These semiaquatic mammals are pinnipeds, making them relatives of Walrein and even moreso Primarina.

They are notable for the complex “guard system” they employ to protect their burrows; the practice somewhat resembles that of the unrelated Sentret in that one or more members of the group willingly increases its odds of being seen by predators in order to protect its allies; this is an example of altruism. Though Furret outgrow this behavior upon evolution, Watchog continue to practice it even when they seem like they would be capable of defending themselves alone, likely because it still increases their chances of survival.","These Pokémon are actually somewhat related to felines, though they are most closely related to Zangoose and Gumshoos.

They are thought to have been our first step towards Pokémon training, helping people hunt even before the first Poké Ball was created. Most canines possess a sense of pack loyalty, but scientists believe Stoutland was especially suited for domestication because Lillipup were predisposed to developing early bonds; they could not defend themselves like the similar Growlithe, so they more readily accepted care from others.","While many canines have been domesticated by humans (Arcanine and Boltund spring to mind), Stoutland are inarguably man’s first and best friend; these Pokémon have been alongside humanity for so long that they have adapted their lifestyles to mesh with it.

They are the smallest member of this group, an inversion in a sense of how Persian are the largest members of the small cats. In terms of behavior, these Pokémon are definitely wild; though it can be argued that Purrloin can be tamed to be at least as “well-behaved” as Glameow (which isn’t saying much at all), Liepard can hardly be domesticated at all; they should not be kept as pets by the average city-dweller, even if their pre-evolutions are debatably docile.","Although Purrloin very much resemble traditional “small cats” like Meowth and Skitty (and similarly are often found in urban areas), these Pokémon are actually “big cats,” like Incineroar and Luxray.

Researchers believe that a very recent common ancestor of these Pokémon radially adapted to fill a number of different niches; Simisage can climb trees in thick woodlands, Simisear can inhabit abandoned, extinct volcanoes, and Simipour can water plants near lakes. They are intelligent creatures that are thought to be rather closely related to humans; their agricultural tendencies only further support this hypothesis.","These three Pokémon are so closely related that some scientists argue that they all should be considered subspecies of a single species; however, since they do not naturally breed together in the wild, they are distinguished in most modern texts.

Musharna are famous for their Dream Mist, a byproduct of the dreams that they consume. The mist is soporific; inhalation will cause a being to fall asleep and experience the dreams held within. While its use as a sleeping aid is obvious, Dream Mist is heavily controlled because of its potential as a hallucinogen; exposure to multiple sources of Dream Mist simultaneously can cause a person to experience all of the contained dreams at once. This practice can be very mentally and psychologically harmful, particularly when mixing different colors of mist.","These Pokémon are very closely related to Hypno, as both are perissodactyls that feed on dreams.

People even once tried to use Pidove as messengers like Pidgey, though their forgetfulness made them a poor option for this task. Research shows, however, that these Pokémon are actually more closely related to Blaziken, who share the line’s strong legs. Unfezant are also notable for being extreme examples of sexual dimorphism and selection, as the elaborate patterns of the males are directly attributable to how females select their mates.","Pidove are similar to Pidgey and Starly in terms of their ecological niche, inhabiting cities in large numbers (though not as numerous as Starly) while their evolutions move out into the wilderness.

Zebstrika are starkly different in terms of temperament, however; they are wildly unpredictable and irritable, making them almost impossible to domesticate. This certainly isn’t from lack of trying, however, as many different groups and organizations have attempted to tame these erratic Pokémon over the past centuries. Their persistent resistance to domestication has even given birth to a popular saying in Unova; the phrase “when the saddle stays on the Zebstrika” is used to express incredulity or disbelief.","Most people know that Zebstrika are very closely related to Rapidash and Mudsdale, as all of these Pokémon resemble each other physiologically.

They don’t possess conventional facial features (at least in earlier forms), and they dwell deep in the earth where little other life can survive. Perhaps most amazingly, Gigalith have essentially developed photosynthesis despite not even being organic life forms; the process is of course drastically different, but it is interesting nonetheless. The radioactive cores within these Pokémon are also subject to intense research. Little to no radiation is emitted from their bodies, so they do a spectacular job of containing such immense energy within themselves; scientists wish to copy this containment in artificial structures.","These Pokémon are very odd, even for an inorganic species.

Most pertinently, they are both cave-dwelling, flying mammals that have poor senses of sight and use echolocation to navigate. Though both evolutions have eyes, they are practically non-functional in Woobat and pale in comparison to the ears of Swoobat. These Pokémon fill a very similar niche as Zubat, but trade in an association with blood-sucking and venom for hearts and affection. Their fur is thought to help them withstand cooler cave environments than their relatives.","These chiropterans are actually very similar to their close relatives Zubat in function, even if they don’t bear much of a physical resemblance.

Excadrill differ in that they hunt other mammals (and in that they actually will fully surface above the soil), but these similarities lead scientists to believe that Diglett somewhat resemble Drilbur beneath the surface. Recently, researchers have suggested that these Pokémon actually eat some of the soil that they burrow through; they hypothesized that this is likely how Excadrill obtain the necessary metals to develop their steel-hard claws.","These insectivorans are most closely related to Dugtrio, who are also tunnel-digging, subterranean creatures that eat insects and plant matter during some point of their lives.

They share the order’s superb hearing (as seen in Wigglytuff, for instance), though they have developed “feelers” that allow them to pinpoint specific areas to listen in on. In the wild, they are thought to hold these feelers against Berries as they tap them to see if they are ripe, or perhaps against the ground to detect vibrations and sense approaching danger. Audino are often seen as a parallel to Chansey, especially in Unova, where they replace them in Pokémon Centers entirely. While Chansey deal with palliative care, though, Audino usually measure vitals prior to treatment. ","Conkeldurr are humanoids, and while they share many similarities with Machamp, they are actually thought to be more closely related to Hariyama. These Fighting-types are famous for their architectural prowess; they are believed to have created concrete and are thought to have taught humans how to do the same.

These Pokémon use the fibrous inner tissue of plant shoots to weave their own judogis (Throh) and karategis (Sawk), finishing them off by tying vines around their waists as belts. It isn’t much of a surprise that these Pokémon are very closely related to one another, having diverged very recently.

They are characterized by their many body segments and legs; one should note, however, that most of a Scolipede’s legs are actually short nubs that line their upper bodies. Four have evolved to become sturdier and support the Pokémon’s weight, and two more have become sharp spikes on their rears that resemble their antennae, perhaps to bewilder prey. Scientists believed that their legs shrank over evolutionary time because of how much energy it cost Scolipede to develop them; by using their horns to gore prey until they could no longer flee, these Pokémon could catch victims even on only four legs.","These arthropods are actually part of their own class, Chilopoda, alongside Centiskorch.

They are known for having very specific preferences for their habitats. These Pokémon have been useful for humans for centuries. Petilil, for example, dwell near fertile soil perfect for agriculture, so they have historically been used to locate arable land. Their leaves are also valued as an herbal stimulant. Lilligant flowers are sublimely fragrant and utilized in aromatherapy. Because of their commercial value and fragile habitats, these vulnerable Pokémon are perhaps one of the most legally-protected species in the world.","Lilligant are part of a group known as the monocots, a group of plant-like Pokémon that also includes Exeggcutor and Lurantis.

While the Red-and Blue-Striped forms differ in fin and eye shape as well as color, they are still capable of interbreeding (and do so occasionally in the wild), so they are considered the same species. Scientists are baffled as to why a Pokémon would evolve to mindlessly attack others of its own species. Some hypothesize that this behavior may be an extension of familial protection; many Pokémon defend their offspring from others of the same species, so perhaps a random mutation early in their evolution triggered Basculin to recognize all members of their form as their “family.”","As their names may suggest, Krookodile are crocodilians, and as such are related to Feraligatr. Ample fossil evidence indicates that these Pokémon were once semiaquatic like their relatives. It is a mystery why they have adapted to life in sandy deserts; they share this evolutionary quirk with Hippowdon. Because two separate species evolved so similarly, some scientists use these Pokémon as evidence towards the existence of a major prehistoric catastrophe that dried up much of the world’s water. Most researchers are skeptical, however; such an event would have occurred far too quickly for any Pokémon to be able to adapt to it over evolutionary time.","As their names may suggest, Krookodile are crocodilians, and as such are related to Feraligatr.

As desert dwellers, they have adapted to survive in very arid conditions. Their thorns are actually modified leaves that serve to protect them from predators. They also practice a specific form of photosynthesis known as CAM photosynthesis, which allows them to open their stomata at night and lessen water loss through transpiration. They perform this process while asleep, as they are diurnal. Maractus become particularly active after it rains, as rainfall will rehydrate their seeds and encourage them to reproduce quickly before the sand dries out again.","Although these Pokémon are crustaceans, they are entirely terrestrial. They share this trait with their closest relative, Crabominable. These Pokémon are famous for their stone shells, which they fashion out of nearby rocks in the area. Their shells protect them from predators, and these Pokémon don’t have to expend any energy to develop them—an evolutionary boon. As a trade-off, however, they do have to spend time finding and preparing rocks, and they are vulnerable until they do so. The benefits largely outweigh the costs, though, as stone is much more durable than the chitin that makes up their exoskeletons.","Although these Pokémon are crustaceans, they are entirely terrestrial.

By simply not discarding their skin after they molt and letting it dry in the desert sun, they essentially fashion leather protection for themselves without having to expend any extra energy. Additionally, they can also use this adaptation to cloak themselves during sandstorms to protect their eyes and mouths. The baggy skins of these Pokémon have inspired the fashion of an urban youth subculture, earning them the nickname of “The Hoodlum Pokémon.”","Scrafty are squamatans, making them related to Pokémon like Kecleon and Helioptile.

Additionally, they are thought to have perhaps patrolled and defended these societies from attackers. They also share most of these traits with Golurk, though the latter don’t have the same association with desert ruins in particular. Exactly how these three Pokémon are related, if they are at all, is still a mystery. Some people believe that ancient peoples may have actually created Sigilyph to defend their cities, but the geoglyph depicting this Pokémon seems to suggest that they were perhaps worshipped rather than commanded.","These Pokémon are perhaps better known by the superstitions surrounding them than by science itself. Yamask, with their eerily humanlike cries and masks, are said to be the spirits of a deceased ancient peoples; Cofagrigus are thought to trap and mummify grave robbers that sneak into their tombs. Phasmologists (scientists who specialize in studying spectral Ghost-types) believe that these Pokémon may actually be related to species like Trevenant and Palossand; all of them are Ghost-types that inhabit or create material bodies, which in the case of Cofagrigus are golden sarcophagi.","These Pokémon are perhaps better known by the superstitions surrounding them than by science itself.

Minccino are famed for their luxurious fur; they were often hunted for this very reason. Just over a century ago, these Pokémon were thought to have gone extinct from overhunting until a few individuals were discovered in a remote mountain crevice.

Just over a century ago, these Pokémon were thought to have gone extinct from overhunting until a few individuals were discovered in a remote mountain crevice. Today, the species is strictly protected by almost all regions of the world, which has helped their numbers recover somewhat. Still poaching is a significant problem to their populations, and they are still critically endangered because of it.","These humanoid Pokémon have been both feared and respected by humans over the course of history. Scientists believe that they are likely most closely related to the Ralts family as well as perhaps Florges. Though many people wish to have their fortunes told by Gothitelle, those that have already received their predictions almost always warn against it. One reason is that their cryptic prophecies are usually indecipherable until the events have already transpired, at which point they become clear in hindsight. Another reason is the so-called “curse of knowledge;” Gothitelle are burdened with knowledge about the future of their loved ones without the ability to alter it.","These humanoid Pokémon have been both feared and respected by humans over the course of history.

Biologists have two reasons to study these creatures—firstly, they are huge single-celled organisms, granting a macroscopic view of a microscopic entity. Secondly, they are an amazing example of convergent evolution, as their organelles have evolved to very much resemble the organs and organ systems of multicellular creatures. Engineers research Reuniclus to learn about their insulating cytoplasm and protective cell membranes. Finally, neuroscientists are particularly interested in Duosion; though other Pokémon have multiple brains, Duosion are the only organic Pokémon in which they share the same head.","This species is a thrill to scientists in all fields.

Ducklett are almost entirely helpless on their own; they dutifully waddle behind their mothers until they become capable of defending themselves. These relatives of Farfetch’d are also notable for how their young imprint on their mothers at birth; they share this behavior with Togepi. Swanna are famous for the dancing, which is imitated in a similar style of classical dance. However, they are less well-known for their hostility; these Pokémon are very aggressive, even when childless.","While many bird Pokémon continue to look after their young after they hatch, Ducklett and Swanna are perhaps the most recognizable example of maternal care in avian species.

Though their cores can remain frigid for extended periods of time in temperate conditions, the slush that covers their heads melts almost immediately when temperatures rise. Scientists are unsure what purpose this slush serves, but some believe that it may help reflect sunlight away from their icy bodies and keep them from warming up. These Pokémon are also notable for being confined almost entirely to the southern hemisphere due to a recent warming period.","Vanilluxe are thought to have been around for thousands of years; even so, they are believed to be the youngest of the purely ice-based Pokémon (the other two being Avalugg and Cryogonal).

They change their physical appearances to camouflage with the shifting flora of the deciduous forests they call home. Deerling achieve this with the aid of moss growing on their fur; this moss is seeded upon birth and changes color to reflect humidity, sunlight, and other environmental conditions. Sawsbuck host their own vegetation on their horns. Recently, it was discovered that these Pokémon seem to partly regulate their own cycles based on the seasons; they respond to the smell of fallen, decaying leaves just as strongly as they do to their own autumn mating pheromones.","These cervid relatives of Stantler are famed for their close connection with the seasons.

They are notable for having evolved membranes under their arms that can catch wind currents and enable them to glide; though this isn’t exactly flight, it is enough to keep them away from most grounded predators (chiropterans like Crobat remain the only known mammals capable of true flight). This gliding technique is shared by the Pokémon Gliscor, who they are unrelated to. Scientists believe that these species may have developed gliding because it is more energy-efficient than flight, which requires flapping, though it is more dependent on environmental conditions as a trade-off.","These coleopterans are most famous for their method of evolution; they steal Shelmet shells and use them as armor. Their oddly-shaped horns are perfect for grasping and pulling their squishy bodies out. The evolutionary strategy of fashioning armor out from an outside source has been seen before in arthropods in the rock-dwelling Crustle. Though they use different protection, the general idea is the same; both Pokémon gain extremely durable shells without having to expend energy creating them themselves. Karrablast have small electrogenetic organs locate at the base of their horns; in the wild, they will use these organs to trigger their evolution with Shelmet.","These coleopterans are most famous for their method of evolution; they steal Shelmet shells and use them as armor.

They are provide an excellent case study as to how traits that are not actively selected against can linger in a population. Though the Poké Ball patterns on Foongus disguise them from avian predators, they serve no such purpose when they evolve into Amoongus. However, since the designs don’t significantly hurt Amoongus’s survival fitness, they still remain present. Scientists believe that these Pokémon  may one day lose this trait, as research shows Amoonguss without the design fare slightly better in the wild.","Amoonguss are easily recognizable as fungi; they are perhaps the most archetypical example of this kingdom, at least moreso than relatives like Breloom.

Like the former, Frillish and Jellicent have paralyzing tentacles that they use to immobilize prey. Frillish and Tentacool also both travel chiefly by floating along ocean currents, though Frillish have a great degree of control while swimming. These Pokémon sport a curious example of sexual dimorphism; males are blue and are said to resemble kings, while females are pink and seem to resemble queens. How or why they developed these features is unknown, but superstitious sailors point to this odd feature as evidence that these Pokémon used to be human.","These Pokémon are cnidarians, making them very close relatives of Tentacruel and also surprisingly Corsola.

These properties are derived from the mucoid membranes that coat their bodies, which is antimicrobial and greatly facilitates the healing of wounds. Alomomola are also interesting because they seem to be instinctively altruistic, even towards Pokémon of other species. Scientists hypothesize that this behavior may encourage other Pokémon to leave them alone; indeed, most other marine species seem to avoid harming Alomomola, perhaps in an implied mutualistic relationship in which they will be healed if injured.","Galvantula are relatives of Ariados. They can be easily distinguished by their hairy bristles, which are an adaptation that Joltik developed to stick to the fur of their hosts. These Pokémon have also evolved a number of secondary eyes that aid them in depth perception and light detection. Perhaps their most amazing adaptation, however, is their ability to electrify their webs so that they can quickly immobilize fleeing prey. Their silk is nearly identical to that of Ariados in composition, but it is slightly modified to be highly conductive of electricity. Because of this property as well as its strength, it is currently being researched for use in electronics.","Galvantula are relatives of Ariados.

Because they dwell in dark caverns where they cannot photosynthesize, these Grass-types have evolved to instead siphon minerals from rocks (in the case of Ferroseed) or hunt live prey (in the case of Ferrothorn). Though scientists once believed that these Pokémon completely changed their feeding habits upon evolution, this isn’t strictly true. Ferroseed actually obtain organic nutrients by attaching themselves to decaying plant matter or carcasses, while Ferrothorn continue to siphon minerals through their feelers into order to maintain their hard exteriors.","Oddly, these Pokémon are in the same family as Whimsicott.

They caused much clamor amongst physicists, as they were reported to be capable of perpetual motion. Further study on the cave and the Pokémon themselves revealed that this isn’t quite the case, however; These Pokémon spin with the aid of magnetic force, converting it into electricity much like a generator. Still, their units are nearly frictionless, making them remarkably efficient. Because they lose so little energy to friction and can expend energy to continue spinning without magnetism, however, it is easy to see why they were thought to be ideal machines.","These Pokémon were discovered just over a hundred years ago in Unova’s Chargestone Cave.

They are classified as fish, but are distinguishable by their lack of jaws; their circular, toothed mouths are flexible because of this. These Pokémon also have cartilaginous skeletons, much like Mantine and Sharpedo. Finally, they have evolved to be capable of life entirely on (damp) land. Their electromagnetic organs, which they use to shock prey, also help them levitate above the ground so they can “swim” in air. Slimy, moisture-retaining mucus coats their skin and allows them to spend extended periods of time away from sources of water without drying out.","Eelektross are one of the most primitive chordates we know of so far.

There have been no large-scale, official studies on these creatures, and no independent freelance researchers have been able to learn anything important about their behavior or origins. Because they were discovered so recently and look unlike most other known species of Pokémon, they still remain unclassified to this day; they share this state of limbo with the likes of Clefable, Lunatone, and Solrock (all of which are also puported to be from space). Theories about their possible extraterrestrial origins, while popular, have little to no evidence substantiating them. ","Very little is known about these incredibly mysterious Pokémon.

Disconcertingly, they are one of the only known species that actively prey upon humans; while Litwick may have lured wild Pokémon with their light while they fed and Chandelure are largely indiscriminate as to what they prey on, Lampent in particular seem to have an affinity for human hospitals and elderly homes. This is likely because no other places sport such a concentration of living beings approaching death. Lampent are feared as counterparts to Dusknoir for this reason, with some believing that evil souls are burned by them instead of being ferried to the underworld.","Ghostly Chandelure burn through life energy as fuel.

At first, they were thought to have perhaps lost the ability of flight over the course of evolution, but new evidence seems to support the idea that Haxorus may in fact have diverged from the lineage before wings were developed; thus, scientists have classified it in its own family, Draco (the remaining winged draconians are in the separate Dracoaves). This new data also suggests that Haxorus are the most primitive of the draconians, a distinction that once belonged to the non-Dragon-type Charizard.","Haxorus are one of a few known draconians that are entirely wingless during all stages of development (the others are Kommo-o and Drampa).

White fur helps Cubchoo blend into the ice and hide from predators, while wide paws help Beartic transverse loose snow. Cubchoo sport a rather unconventional defense mechanism in the form of their supercooling snot; scientists have discovered that it contains an antifreeze so it remains gooey even at subzero temperatures. Beartic are also unique because they have evolved to adept swimmers as they primarily hunt aquatic prey. They are apex predators and a keystone species where they dwell; however, a warming climate currently threatens the glaciers they call home.","Beartic are clearly ursines like Bewear and Ursaring, but they have adapted to polar conditions.

Their hexagonal bodies mirrors that of a snowflake crystal are composed almost entirely of water. Two of their properties completely bewilder scientists. The first is how they sublimate and deposit, completely skipping liquid form. Unlike water, Cryogonal turn gaseous when above 32°F (0°C); it is unknown how or why they do this. The second is their predatory nature; since they are mostly water, researchers don’t know what these Pokémon do with the organic compounds they consume. Little formal research has been conducted on Cryogonal because of how elusive they are.","Accelgor are gastropods thought to be closely related to Magcargo. They are famous for how they evolve alongside Karrablast; however, scientists have for a long time been baffled as to why they seem to try their best to avoid and resist the very Pokémon they need for evolution. The most compelling explanation suggests that Shelmet may actually be evolutionarily-pressured to become neotenous; though incredibly fast, Accelgor are also very frail and exposed to the elements; additionally, they require much more energy to survive than Shelmet because they are active hunters. Thus, it is possible that Shelmet that resist evolution are more likely to survive and reproduce.","Accelgor are gastropods thought to be closely related to Magcargo.

They are most distinctive for their odd body plan; these Pokémon are entirely flat, with both of their eyes having migrated to the same side of their bodies. This shape enables them to hide just barely beneath the mud of stagnant marshes and fens, waiting patiently for unwary prey to step on top of them. Though scientists once placed these Pokémon alongside Lanturn due to their similar electrogenetic organs, DNA evidence now proves that the two evolved their electrical powers separately; they are each classified in their own order as a result.","These mustelids are relatives of Furret, Floatzel, and Weavile. They are notable for their long arm fur, which hangs over the wrists of Mienfoo and completely drapes the hands of Mienshao. They have adapted their own fur into what are essentially whips. Scientists believe that this species may have adapted longer fur in order to dwell in the chillier altitudes of mountains; however their arm fur was very likely an extreme variation that resulted from mutation and persisted over generations because of its usefulness.

They inhabit the abandoned tunnels of burrowing Pokémon like Onix and Excadrill; because these labyrinths are often just barely wide enough for them to travel through, however. these Pokémon have gradually lost the ability to fly over time, their wings having become incapable of lifting their own body weight. These ectotherms have repurposed these appendages, however, to spread flat against their backs to maximize surface area when sunbathing. Scientists often point to Druddigon as an example of how structures once intended for a certain function can be evolutionarily repurposed for another.","As with many other inorganic Pokémon, the origins of this species are unclear. They share more than a few similarities with Claydol and Sigilyph, both of which are also clay-based creatures that are believed by some to have been created by ancient humans (though they disagree as to whether or not the same technology, or even the same people, created all of these Pokémon). However, both Golett and Golurk seem to be powered by a mysteriously, unidentifiable energy located within their chests. Though some believe this may be the result of some sort of perpetual motion machine, their Ghost-typings suggest that this energy may possibly be spiritual in nature. For this reason, they are classified in Spectrae rather than Mineralia.","As with many other inorganic Pokémon, the origins of this species are unclear.

While most appear to be modified horns or claws, the blades on their torsos that they use to latch onto enemies have no analogues, leading scientists to believe that they likely arose through random mutation. Pawniard and Bisharp are also unique amongst the humanoids because they follow a pack social structure with a clearly-defined leader. This is a characteristic seen most often in canines (and a few other species, notably the avian Honchkrow), so their use of it is very intriguing to behavioral scientists.","These humanoids are most notable for the numerous, sharp blades that jut out from all over their bodies.

While all are thought to have descended from a common ancestor, Bouffalant are believed to be more similar to this relative than the other two.  Unlike Tauros and Miltank, Bouffalant have proven to be very resistant to domestication. Though individuals can easily be tamed (trained to be comfortable around humans), centuries of effort to domesticate them (breed them so they are genetically predisposed to be useful to us) have unquestionably failed. This odd difference mirrors that of the domesticable Rapidash and the related, but wild Zebstrika. Scientists are unsure why such contrast exists in such close relatives.","These birds of prey are most closely related to Staraptor. They represent the virtues of courage and loyalty in most regions, though some (notably Kanto and Johto) delegate this role to Fearow instead. Braviary are unique amongst their relatives in that they are primarily piscivorous, as they have adapted to thrive in wetland environments. The way these Pokémon raise their young is also notable; though they lay three eggs, they will only feed the most rambunctious while letting the other two perish. Scientists believe that this harsh process very strongly selects for Rufflet to be bigger and stronger, and thus more likely to survive once they leave the nest.","These birds of prey are most closely related to Staraptor.

They are the most well-known example of an “evolutionary arms-race,” as they and Durant have evolved over thousands of years to resist and overcome the adaptations of the other. Most notably, Heatmor are believed to have developed their firepower as a direct response to the metal exoskeletons of Durant; what once was an adaptation Durant evolved to resist being preyed upon is now a weakness that Heatmor can easily exploit.","Although they are wingless, Durant are relatives of Vespiquen and Beedrill; they share their eusocial colony with the former. Durant are most famous for their co-evolution with Heatmor. The theory states that Heatmor used to be Normal-types thousands of years ago, using their claws and teeth to prey upon Bug-type Durant. Over time, Durant evolved steel exoskeletons so they could resist the attacks of their predators. In response, Heatmor evolved to be Fire-types to roast Durant within their own carapaces. In recent times, this theory has been met with increasing criticism, namely in how Heatmor could have developed their firepower so quickly.","These winged draconians have adapted to life in dark caverns. Their eyes have withered away into vestigial organs over time and evolution, leaving them blind as a result. For a long time, researchers thought that these Pokémon felt their way around with their heads and mouths, recklessly stumbling about in search of food. However, more recent studies seem to suggest that these Pokémon may have some sort of organ to help them detect the infrared thermal radiation of prey. Also notable is the polycephaly of Zweilous and Hydreigon; scientists are unsure why these Pokémon (and others like Dodrio) have evolved to be this way.","These winged draconians have adapted to life in dark caverns.

Because they are hemimetabolic, they are thought to be relatives of Masquerain and Venomoth. One may notice that these Pokémon have six wings as opposed to the conventional two or four; scientists believe that this extra set of wings must serve some sort of purpose beyond flight, as they actually make Volcarona less agile than if they only had four wings. One hypothesis postulates that this additional set allows them to spread their fiery scales more quickly, allowing them to better defend themselves from attackers. Thus, they may give Volcarona a survival advantage despite slightly hindering their flight. ","Majestic Volcarona are lepidopterans.

However, while Togedemaru reinforce their spikes with metal, Chesnaught and their pre-evolutions instead utilize wood. They are also more distantly related to Dugtrio and Excadrill. These Pokémon hibernate during cold weather; by lowering their internal body temperatures, they can conserve valuable energy during times of hardship. Prior to hibernation, they will begin to consume more nuts, legumes, and other fat-rich foods in order to prepare for this period.","Chesnaught are very closely related to Togedemaru, who are similarly-spined to defend themselves from predators.

Unique amongst their relatives Greninja have adapted to utilize speed and stealth as their primary methods of both defense and offense; consequently, however, they lack the poison of Toxicroak and Seismitoad or the brute strength of Poliwrath. Greninja are also notable for how they oddly store their tongues around their necks. It is thought that they do this because their heads have narrowed over time to become more streamlined, becoming too small for them to fit their long tongues into.","Out of all of the anurans, Greninja are actually most closely related to the Poliwag family, even though they may more closely resemble Toxicroak in terms of physiology.

Though all Eeveelutions are adapted to a different environment, they all are exceedingly rare in the wild, and are adapted to life alongside people.

In fact, they replace Pidgeot in Kalos in its “main” five birds, though it more specifically represents grace rather than beauty. They are famous for their elegant style of fighting, which is both watched and imitated by humans. Notably, Crasher Wake, the Gym Leader of the Pastoria Gym in Sinnoh practices this form of wrestling in his spare time. Their signature technique, Flying Press, is also notable for simultaneously being both a Flying- and a Fighting-type attack.","Like many other rodents with cheek pouches (for instance, Emolga, Plusle, and Minun), Dedenne wield electrical abilities. They also can generate radio waves through their wiry antennae, using this capability to communicate with one another across long distances. Dedenne are also considerably smaller than their relatives. While scientists aren’t quite sure why they evolved their minute stature, they hypothesize that it may have to do with avoiding predators or optimizing reproductive efficiency—these creatures breed often and produce many offspring, so it may be advantageous for them to divert energy away from growth and into reproduction.","Scientists know very little about these mysterious, ancient Pokémon. They are tentatively placed alongside Gigalith in classification because of their gem-like growths and affinity for high-pressure environments. Carbink seem to barely even function as Pokémon most of the time; it is thought that they vast majority of them are likely lying dormant in undisturbed sections of the earth, and individuals that have been found do not seem to eat, drink, or breathe.

They are relatives of Gastrodon (a connection more easily seen in Goomy and Sliggoo than Goodra). Though Sliggoo may seem shelled like Magcargo, this growth is actually a hump designed to store its coiled intestines. Goodra seem to rather inexplicably possess the Dragon-typing; scientists have been unable to explain this phenomenon. In fact, the mere existence of these Pokémon seems to challenge the notion of how Pokémon types even evolved, as there seem to have been no evolutionary conditions that would have pressured these gastropods to adopt the Dragon-type.","Though Goodra may not look the part, these odd creatures are actually gastropods.

While other organisms seem to fulfill a specific niche (if they evolved to be that way) or serve a certain purpose (if they were bred or perhaps created to do so), Klefki seem to desire nothing more than to collect keys. While people have put this affinity to use by using them to protect valuables, these Pokémon began stealing keys long before humans began doing this. Some of the wildest theories regarding Klefki suggest that they may in fact be searching for certain keys in particular, such as those that could open interdimensional doorways.","Like how Palossand are believed to be spirits inhabiting piles of sand and Aegislash said to be possessed swords, Trevenant are thought to be the spirits of lost travelers encased in trees. Though feared by rural travelers because of how they are purported to trap people for all of eternity in their woods, these creatures are actually vital to the forests that they inhabit. Trevenant protect trees growing in areas that they likely would not be able to continue surviving in otherwise. While outside conditions may be changing, Trevenant woods remain unchanging, as if stuck in time, thanks to the support of these Pokémon.","Like how Palossand are believed to be spirits inhabiting piles of sand and Aegislash said to be possessed swords, Trevenant are thought to be the spirits of lost travelers encased in trees.

Some scientists believe that they should be placed alongside the likes of Trevenant under the assumption that they are also spirits that hide in physical objects. Others argue that they are perhaps entirely organic in origin, as there is no scientific evidence towards the former claim. These Pokémon are also notable for their wide range of sizes. It is believed that these different sizes are better suited for different environments, as they trade speed for durability as they get larger. Thus, small individuals are more fit when competition is heavy, while large ones fare better when defense from foes is necessary.","The classification of these Pokémon has been heavily disputed.

As ice-based Pokémon like Vanilluxe and Cryogonal, these creatures are confined to the coldest parts of the world where temperatures never rise above freezing. Rather oddly for an inorganic species, these Pokémon possess very strong parental instincts and raise their children until evolution. It is thought they they evolved to be this way because the relationship is mutualistic; Bergmite receive transportation and cold air from their parents, while Avalugg gain aerial protection from their offspring.","These icy Pokémon are believed to be very ancient and long-lived; some scientists even believe that some Avalugg alive today have lived through the last ice age.

Like their relatives, Noivern dwell in caves and utilize echolocation to navigate their dark environments. For reasons scientists have not yet figured out, Noivern seem to have moved their sonic organs to their ears rather than their mouths through evolution. Some researchers hypothesize that the shape of their ears, in addition to improving their hearing capabilities, may also amplifying the volume of the sound waves being produced within them. This would explain how Noivern utilize powerful sound-based moves like Boomburst in battle.","These Pokémon are chiropterans, much like Woobat and Zubat.

However, while Pyroar make their homes in dry savannas, Incineroar prefer humid jungles and grasslands. The placement of the flame sacs of Torracat and Incineroar seems odd from an evolutionary standpoint, as it seems illogical to place such important organs outside of the body (especially in wet rainforests). Scientists believe that this may serve two purposes. The first is that these Pokémon actually take advantage of humidity and airflow to cool their sacs and keep them from overheating; the second is that the sizes of these sacs are gauged in sexual selection.","Incineroar are big cats like Luxray and Pyroar; they also share their Fire-typing with the latter.

Members of this line—particularly Trumbeak—are infamous for their loud calls, which make them a nuisance in many tropical communities. However, these Pokémon are a vital part of rainforest ecosystems as key seed dispersers. As they collect, eat, and fire seeds, they help spread them long distances away from where they were dropped. In this way, Toucannon and their pre-evolutions help new plants grow away from areas of high competition and keep their habitats well-foliaged.","Though Toucannon are somewhat related to Xatu, they belong to an entirely different order of avians, of which they are the sole member.

They are by far most infamous in the Alola region, where they are not even native. In fact, their status as an invasive species is what makes them so well known; the case of Yungoos and Rattata is the classic example of biological control gone wrong in ecology classrooms. The primary issue with their introduction was that Yungoos were generalists; they easily preyed upon native species if Rattata were not readily available. Thus, when Rattata moved into cities and became nocturnal to avoid them, there was no evolutionary pressure for Yungoos to do the same—they could simply find food elsewhere.","Gumshoos are very close relatives of Zangoose.

Their most notable adaptation is obviously their electrogenetic capabilities; while this adaptation has been noted before in arthropods with Galvantula, scientists are nearly certain that these two evolutionary traits arose independently from one another. Galvantula seem to have evolved electrified webs to stun and hunt prey, while Vikavolt appear to have developed it to fend themselves from Flying-types; though they do use electricity to hunt, studies show that their strong jaws serve them well enough on their own; there must be another benefit of electricity to offset energy cost, or non-electrogenetic Vikavolt would be more fit. Because they can use Charjabug to augment their own abilities, both male and female Vikavolt will care for their young until adulthood, unlike many other insectile Pokémon.","Vikavolt are in the same genus as Pinsir.

Terrestrial Crabominable are relatives of Crustle, with whom they share an intolerance of water. It is thought that Crabrawler initially evolved their climbing instincts to avoid terrestrial predators. Very few Crabrawler ascend high enough to evolve into Crabominable, however. Furthermore, it has recently been discovered that Crabominable do not reproduce in the wild, and that all offspring are produced by Crabrawler. Scientists believe that Crabominable are an evolutionary quirk resulting from dormant genes being expressed rather than a standard part of a Crabrawler’s life cycle.","Both Crabrawler and Crabominable are very interesting Pokémon in their own rights.

Initially, it was thought that the Pokémon developed different typings, appearances, and behaviors to adapt to the different island environments. The theory that distinct dances evolved according to mate selection and geographical isolation was particularly promising. When it was discovered that Oricorio could change forms based on flower nectar, however, these hypotheses were quickly disproven. Experiments show that Oricorio only react to the nectar of specific flower species native to Alola; researchers are currently investigating the possibility of coevolution between Oricorio and these flowers.","Ribombee belong to their own order of insects; though many mistakenly believe that they are relatives of Beedrill and Vespiquen, this is not actually the case. Ribombee are famous for their Pollen Puffs, which can possess either harmful or healing properties depending on what they contain. These Puffs are a popular treat in many regions, with specialty ones often being marketed as supplements for their nutrition or health properties. Cutiefly are also notable for being able to sense the auras of living things; Ribombee seem to possess this trait to a lesser degree, relying more on eyesight to navigate.

Indeed, researchers believe that Rockruff domestication likely originated in barren deserts, where they were the most acceptable option; their “rebellious” phases, in hindsight, would have spelled the end of domestication practices if easier choices were available.","As canines, Lycanroc are close relatives of Manectric, Arcanine, and Stoutland.

Though prey species often take solace in the idea of “safety in numbers,” Wishiwashi take this to the extreme with their School Forms. The level of coordination involved in such formations is the subject of intense research. Indeed, the hormones and receptors required to remain in perfect sync are so complex that they do not fully develop for some time after Wishiwashi are born, explaining why young Wishiwashi are unable to school. Some predators seem to have evolved to deal with these schools; ambush tactics can catch lone Wishiwashi before they can signal to their allies.","These relatives of Starmie have long been infamous as a great danger to Corsola reefs. It should be noted, however, that Mareanie and Toxapex actually play an important role in reef ecosystems as long as their populations are kept in check; as one of the only consumers of Corsola horns, these Pokémon maintain habitat heterogeneity by creating different densities of horns as they feed and preventing the horns from building up to excessive levels. It is only during population booms that they pose a grave danger to reef stability; scientists believe that warming sea temperatures, which are favorable for Mareanie, may lead to an unprecedented boom in their numbers.","These relatives of Starmie have long been infamous as a great danger to Corsola reefs.

However, few Mudsdale still remain in the wild because of past overhunting. Though some organizations have considered reintroducing these Pokémon into their old natural habitats, such a practice would have to be closely monitored in order to ensure no unintended ecological ramifications would follow.

Though they share a common ancestor with Ariados (and more distantly, Galvantula), they are believed to have diverged quite a long time ago to adapt to life underwater, only recently returning partially to land. Their bubbles are reinforced with some of the same proteins found in Ariados silk, improving their stability. Recently, scientists have discovered that their bubbles actually passively facilitate the diffusion of oxygen into and carbon dioxide out of them from air. However, the process still favors the loss of oxygen overall, so these Pokémon must replenish their supplies periodically.","Surprisingly for an arachnid, Araquanid are actually primarily aquatic.

Unlike Vileplume or Victreebel, Lurantis are capable of photosynthesis, making it somewhat of a mystery why they would have evolved to hunt for sustenance. Scientists believe that they became predators due to a lack of consistent sunlight on the forest floor where they dwell.

These Pokémon are shrouded in folklore, some of which science has had an easier time explaining than others. While the use of pulsating spore to lure prey and interconnecting mycelium networks to communicate have both been well-studied, the behavior of Shiinotic when not hunting is poorly studied.

This is because their combustion actually generates water vapor as a byproduct, which they can then use to keep themselves hydrated. While this is not very efficient, it is enough to tide them over until rainfall during dry spells. If water is very scarce, Salazzle will send Salandit in all different directions to find a source of it.","Though these Pokémon seem to be reptilian in nature, they are actually amphibians; specifically, they are caudatans like Quagsire.

Since their niches are so similar, competition likely keeps them from coexisting. This does raise the question of how they evolved to be so distinct in the first place, however. Researchers currently believe that Bewear originated from the islands of Alola, where vast geographical separation would have kept the two species distinct.","Bewear belong to the same genus as Ursaring and Bewear, a relationship made obvious by their similar appearances.

Tsareena have a somewhat odd community structure in the wild; most Bounsweet never evolve into Steenee, as they serve as prey to many jungle predators. Similarly, most Steenee never evolve into Tsareena. Furthermore, Tsareena do not seem to reproduce in the wild, so wild Bounsweet exclusively arise from Steenee. It appears that Tsareena serve to protect offspring that are not their own, while Steenee carry out most other tasks.

Luckily, thanks to their presence in hospitals, they have become increasingly easy to study. Shockingly, Comfey may be the only known Pokémon in the plantoid kingdom that are not Grass-types. This disproves a long-standing hypothesis that they were relatives of Florges, fellow Fairy-types associated with flowers. While the timescale and mechanisms by which this evolution occurred is unknown, DNA analysis shows far more similarities with Lilligant than Florges. To compound this, Comfey possess (admittedly nonfunctional) chloroplasts like most Grass-types, which Florges do not.","Oranguru have sparked debate in the practice of Pokémon training itself. These great apes are close relatives of Darmanitan. However, their great intelligence and dexterity with tools make them seem far more humanlike in nature; the fact that they can reportedly wield Poké Balls and other human implements further cements this. Moderate anti-training advocates argue that Oranguru are too intellectual to be confined by trainers, while those in favor point to Pokémon like Alakazam and Slowking as precedents. Extreme training abolitionists, of course, call upon Oranguru as an example that Pokémon as a whole should not be trained at all.","Passimian are relatives of Primeape and Ambipom. Like the latter, they are a social species that work together in the wild. Passimian have a very sophisticated social structure, however, that in fact is one of the most advanced ones known to science. Also notable is their use of tools—specifically, they use Berries both as weapons and as a defense (most obviously in their use of their hard rinds as helmets). While many primates utilize tools to some extent, they are rarely as integral to their lifestyles as they are to that of Passimian. This is even more significant considering that Passimian are more primitive, evolutionarily speaking, than the likes of intelligent Oranguru.","These Pokémon are actually crustaceans, though they are more closely related to Pokémon like Clawitzer than to Barbaracle. Though they are often ridiculed for their cowardliness in popular culture, their skittish behavior actually seems to be a highly effective survival tactic. Wimpod are nearly defenseless other than their irritating poisonous fluids and hard exoskeletons, yet no known Pokémon prey on them with regularity. Since they can eat nearly anything, these creatures have no need to risk staying out in the open for resources, as they can always find them elsewhere. Thus, fleeing at the first sign of danger keeps them safe with little opportunity cost.","These Pokémon are actually crustaceans, though they are more closely related to Pokémon like Clawitzer than to Barbaracle.

While evolutionary relationships within this group are murky, if existent at all, scientists have noted close similarities between how Palossand and Trevenant reproduce. Specifically, the adult forms of these creatures capture hapless victims in their respective habitats to somehow create new members of the species. Since scientists do not know how other members of the group reproduce as of yet, it is unknown how widespread this mechanism is amongst other spectral species. Research is currently being aimed at Aegislash reproduction to illuminate this, as Kalosian myths hint they may reproduce similarly.","Palossand are classified alongside Dhelmise and Trevenant.

They are known for their self-destructive habit of sticking firmly on land until they starve. This behavior has historically perplexed scientists, but a promising hypothesis suggests that humans are directly responsible. Pyukumuku are naturally immobile, as sea currents help bring new detritus without the need to move. On land, such behavior should be deleterious. Pyukumuku in tourist destinations, though, can move onto beaches where waste is abundant and then be tossed back into the sea without having to expend energy. This is supported by the fact that Pyukumuku in remote areas rarely beach themselves.","The mere consideration of Silvally as Pokémon was heavily contested; their artificial origins and the ban on their creations caused many to push to ignore them as “aberrations;” once the three living individuals passed, these creatures would effectively no longer exist. Alolan Professors Kukui and Burnet as well as Aether Foundation president and Silvally-owner Gladion led the charge for their recognition. They cited other synthetic Pokémon like Porygon and Genesect as well as fossil Pokémon that have already gone extinct as precedents; they succeeded, though some believe a covert deal regarding Alola’s new League may have been struck to cement this.","The mere consideration of Silvally as Pokémon was heavily contested; their artificial origins and the ban on their creations caused many to push to ignore them as “aberrations;” once the three living individuals passed, these creatures would effectively no longer exist.

Though they are often thought to be related to Lunatone and Solrock, their Flying-typings and appearance in areas where these species are not found seem to disprove this (Lunatone and Solrock are always found in the same regions, albeit not always at the same time). In the absence of evidence, they are currently classified alongside other mineral-based, terrestrial species. Their life cycles are also very mysterious; Minior inevitably die when they eventually crash to earth, having become too heavy from the dust they must eat to survive. Some point to this “death switch” as evidence they cannot have evolved naturally.","Komala have been intensely researched for their bizarre states of constant sleep. Brain wave analyses show that these Pokémon are at least somewhat responsive to stimuli, though their reception seems quite dull. Exactly how Komala perceive the world is a mystery; some believe that they hazily drift through life from birth to death, only barely conscious enough to eat and reproduce. Others are more optimistic, believing that Komala dream so vividly that they can practically “see” the world in their fantasies. Dream Mist is blurry when used to show their dreams; whether this is how they see the world or simply how we perceive their “dreams” is unknown.","These odd-looking Pokémon are relatives of Torkoal, Torterra, and Blastoise, but they are more distantly related than the three are to one another. They do share more than a few similarities with Torkoal, however; both are slow, volcano-dwelling chelonians that consume inorganic materials in order to facilitate their defenses. They seem to have evolved these adaptations separately from one another, however, as these similarities are superficial rather than biological. Most significantly, Torkoal consume coal as their sole source of energy, while Turtonator consume sulfur as a way to hunt prey; they do not burn the material for fuel like Torkoal.","With their electrical pouches and small stature, it would seem that Togedemaru are close cousins with the likes of Plusle, Minun, and Dedenne. These Pokémon are actually very close relatives of Chesnaught, however, being in the same genus. They are not even in the same order as “true” electric rodents. DNA analysis of the electric rodents, Togedemaru, and their close relatives reveal that Togedemaru evolved their electrical capabilities earlier than the common ancestor of the modern electric rodents. Scientists believe that geographic isolation may have kept the trait in Alola with Togedemaru, explaining why it was unseen elsewhere until some time later.","Mimikyu are a very peculiar species of Pokémon, as their existence and behavior seems to tie them very closely with humans. Their Pikachu disguises appear to be a recent innovation, as such merchandise only became popular around 20 years ago. It is unknown how these Pokémon behaved before this time, if they even existed at all. Some believe that they may have disguised themselves differently to appeal to people, but were not recognized as Pokémon at the time. Similarly, some scientists hypothesize that some Mimikyu may one day change their disguises to better fit shifting trends.","These relatives of Alomomola possess many evolutionary tactics that, while individually effective, seem to overlap excessively or interfere with one another. For instance, their bright coloration may be an effective warning of danger, but the sound of their grinding serves the purpose just as well. Vibrant colors also seem superfluous on a species that is almost entirely buried in sand. Scientists believe that their colorations may have to do with mate selection because of this. Their sharp teeth may seem odd at first as well, as they can already keep predators at bay with their psychokinesis. They make more sense when one considers their shellfish prey, however.","Drampa are wingless draconians, making them relatives of Haxorus and Kommo-o. Unusually for this group of Pokémon, Drampa are famously benevolent and docile; they are herbivorous and thrive alongside humans, further contrasting the likes of Hydreigon or Druddigon. Drampa do possess some characteristically draconian traits, however. They seclude themselves high up in the mountains for some parts of the day and enter blind fits of rage when angered. Some scientists believe that their friendliness and herbivory may be related; farmers were much more likely to let peaceful Drampa descend into their Berry fields than aggressive ones.","Dhelmise are very mysterious Pokémon that we know little about. For a long time, they were thought to be possessed anchors; we now know that whatever “life” these creatures possess resides in the kelp, as kelpless individuals are just as inanimate as real anchors. Though trees and seaweed aren’t even in the same family, Dhelmise are currently grouped with Trevenant in that both are thought to be living or once-living things possessed by spirits. It is easy to see why Dhelmise bind themselves to anchors, however; floating, limp kelp would likely be easy food for many oceanic species, possessed or not.","Kommo-o are wingless draconians like Drampa and Haxorus. Their bipedal stances and tough armor suggest a closer relationship with the latter. While Haxorus tend to dwell near rivers and other sources of flowing water, however, Kommo-o prefer dry, barren habitats. Their weaponized scales are a very interesting adaptation; scientists believe that they may have initially developed to protect these Pokémon from harsh environmental conditions before expanding to fill other roles. Sexual selection also likely played a part in their evolution, as mates seem to assess one another upon scale quality and sturdiness.","Kommo-o are wingless draconians like Drampa and Haxorus.

The family resemblance is larger than one may think it is at a first glance; both Kecleon and Sobble can effectively become invisible by changing their skin patterns, though Sobble can only do so in contact with water. This skill in deception continues in later evolutions, though it manifests in different ways. Scientists believe that Sobble take advantage of how water diffracts light in order to cloak themselves much more efficiently than Kecleon. As they are almost always near water anyways in the wild, the reduced energy cost of doing so was worth the limiting drawback from an evolutionary standpoint.","Inteleon are in the same genus as Kecleon, making them semiaquatic squamatans rather than the amphibians they are commonly mistaken to be.

Morpeko, a more (but only slightly so) distant relative, seems to maintain both elastic cheeks as well as electric sacs. Scientists are still unsure whether Greedent, then, represent more primitive relatives to all above Pokémon who have not yet developed electrogenesis, or if they have lost their electrical capabilities as they evolved over time.

This is much easier when raising a young Nickit, though both evolutions can be weaned off their kleptomancy over time, as the consistent food and shelter a trainer provides make such behavior unnecessary for trained individuals.","These tricky Pokémon have a habit of stealing even from their trainers.

Eldegoss cotton is considered much more of a luxury product than Cottonee and Whimsicott cotton, not only because of its glossier texture but also because of its difficulty of harvest. Unlike Cottonee and Whimsicott, who shed cotton puffs regularly, Eldegoss shed quite infrequently. Additionally, Eldegoss cotton is littered with seeds, which for many years required manual removal  (a process called ginning). It was not until a Unovan inventor mechanized the process that production was streamlined, enabling production on the scale that regions like southern Galar employ today.","Unsurprisingly, these Pokémon are in the same genus as Whimsicott, sharing their fluffy cotton fluff and habit of floating away on breezes.

Further research, however, has elucidated a genetic distinction between the two groups. Still, Pelipper remains this Pokémon’s closest extant relative. Cramorant are thought to be a quite ancient species, with similar-looking ancestors co-existing with the likes of Tyrantrum. Some researchers believe that they used to be much more widespread as well, based on their presence in the fossil records of many distinct continents. Their diverse diets may have made them resistant to environmental changes that would have wiped out entire food sources for more picky eaters.","Both evolutions are hunters that primarily prey upon piscine species.

Whereas Scolipede prioritize speed and brute strength, Centiskorch instead rely on maneuverability and literal firepower. Researchers have postulated that Centiskorch have in fact reached a natural lower limit on body thickness; any thinner would prevent their internal organs from fitting together properly.","Centiskorch are a part of Chilopoda alongside Scolipede. Sharing an an elongated body and many pairs of legs, their most notable difference is their body structure; while Scolipede are rounded and almost equine in posture, Centiskorch are flattened like ribbons and generally stay close to the ground. Scientists believe that this adaptation allowed Centiskorch to fit into the tight nooks and crannies between rocks on the mountainside, allowing them to seek out hidden prey.

Much like their more distant relative Malamar, these cephalopods can spend significant amounts of time out of the water with no ill effects. Scientists hypothesize that Grapploct may have evolved their punching prowess as a method of ambush hunting, allowing them to make up for their middling aquatic speed by lashing out at and immobilizing passing prey with powerful blows. The strengthened muscles that allowed this then helped Grapploct maneuver more easily in shallow waters and perhaps even the shoreline for brief periods of time. Eventually, available resources further inland may have pressured them to evolve full amphibian behavior in order to exploit these resources.","These close relatives of Octillery are notable for their semiaquatic lifestyles.

Phasmologists liken them to Pokémon like Trevenant and Palossand for this reason. Some believe that their particular affinity for fine porcelain, and the dislike that Polteageist have of forgeries, may link them specifically to the spirits of deceased royal aristocrats. Their association with Galar, a region known for its aristocracy, further supports this hypothesis. Exactly why these Pokémon choose to inhabit tea specifically, rather than the vessels containing it, however, remains a mystery. Indeed, this oddity is reflected in its scientific name; Murrina refers to porcelain rather than tea, as these Pokémon were once mistakenly thought to inhabit the cups and pots containing the liquid instead of the tea itself.","These peculiar Pokémon are similar to other Ghost-types in that they are believed to be spirits inhabiting a material vessel.

While Gardevoir will tolerate or even appreciate strong emotions, however, Hatterene detest them, and the two species have starkly opposing opinions of the average human as a result. Some scientists even believe that this contrast in how these Pokémon handle emotional stress was a contributing factor to their development as separate species. According to this theory, the two shared a common ancestor who underwent divergent evolution to fill two niches: one embracing and feeding upon emotion, and the other shying away from it and using it as a warning system to detect danger.","Hatterene are thought to be very close relatives of Gardevoir and Gallade; both are humanoid creatures that are highly sensitive to the emotional states of others.

They were once tentatively placed in the genus Similis due to their humanoid proportions, but they were noticeably less humanoid than many of the genus's other members. Some researchers proposed a new genus, Fascinus, to contain the fae-like species that did not quite fit in with the other humanoids. In particular, all members of this genus shared a Fairy-typing in addition to general physiological similarities. After a few years of gaining traction, this addition has now been adopted by mainstream taxonomy. Today Impidimp now comfortably fit into Fascinus  with the likes of Hatterene, Alcremie, and Mawile.","Impidimp have historically been difficult to classify.

Its closest extant relative is perhaps the Pokémon Spinda, even though it superficially resembles the likes of Furret or Floatzel. The family is of particular interest to some urban scientists because it seems to have not only persisted, but thrived in deforested areas turned into cities. Zigzagoon are well adapted to foraging in trash cans for food, and Linoone can easily dash through the straight, grid-like streets of major metropolises. Their success is a testament to nature’s resilience and adaptability even in the face of change.","While Persian are unmistakably felines, the scientific community has only recently reached a consensus as to exactly where the Pokémon stand in the family. Physically, both in morphology and in size, Persian appear to be “big cats,” and were once grouped as such alongside the likes of Liepard, Pyroar, and Luxray. They are now classified with the “small cats,” albeit as the largest members of the group, due to recent DNA and skeletal evidence. The resemblances between Meowth and other small cats like Skitty and Glameow are readily apparent. Additionally, like the other small cats, Persian tend to thrive in urban environments, either as strays or as pets.","Corsola are an integral part of tropical marine ecosystems. Their horns, both live and discarded, form the foundation of reefs, providing nooks and crannies for small Pokémon to hide in. However, because Corsola are very sensitive to changes in temperature and water purity, the reefs that they form are also fragile. Most notably, the worldwide increase in pollution levels due to human activity has adversely affected Corsola reefs, causing them to decay and shrink in area. Fierce conservation efforts to protect these Pokémon and the ecosystems they support are underway. These surprisingly-close relatives of Tentacruel are also lauded for their regenerative abilities.","Farfetch’d are very rare in the wild because of overhunting in the recent past. For this reason, information that would normally arise from naturalistic observation of the Pokémon is scarce. Regardless, they clearly appear to be waterfowl, grouped with Pokémon like Swanna and Golduck (though the placement of the latter is very controversial). Though they appear to be rather “generic” and typical of their order, they do have a notable adaptation in that their wings have evolved to become more finger-like in order to allow them to better grasp leeks. This is significant in that it is one of the few known natural cases where a species has evolved the ability to use tools.","Many people find Mr. Mime to be deeply unsettling because of how humanoid, but not quite human, they look. Researchers agree that they are likely the closest link between people and Pokémon, citing support such as: their similar physiology, their great intellect, their affinities for towns and cities, their distinctly human-like skin, and their near-identical brain structures. The physical differences between people and Mr. Mime can largely be attributed to two primary differences. Firstly, these Pokémon store fat entirely in their torsos, giving them very slender limbs. Secondly, their joints are all synovial, allowing them to bend at odd, sometimes disturbing angles.","These Pokémon are perhaps better known by the superstitions surrounding them than by science itself. Yamask, with their eerily humanlike cries and masks, are said to be the spirits of a deceased ancient peoples; Cofagrigus are thought to trap and mummify grave robbers that sneak into their tombs. Phasmologists (scientists who specialize in studying spectral Ghost-types) believe that these Pokémon may actually be related to species like Trevenant and Palossand; all of them are Ghost-types that inhabit or create material bodies, which in the case of Cofagrigus are golden sarcophagi.","Alcremie are fascinating creatures, not least because they are made more or less entirely out of a cream-like substance. Scientists have discovered that Alcremie do in fact consist of cells as well, but these cells are clustered tightly together and are enveloped thickly by airy cream. It is thought that Alcremie cells provide them with the bare minimum to see, hear, and maintain a rough structure. A significant portion of them are actually dedicated to secreting the cream that makes up the majority of their bodies. How such a drastic physiology may have evolved is a mystery that still stumps scientists to this day, and the fragility of Milcery and Alcremie make them difficult to study closely without causing them harm.","Alcremie are fascinating creatures, not least because they are made more or less entirely out of a cream-like substance.

However, beyond this peculiar quirk, the two share almost nothing in common (Exeggcute being plant-like Pokémon and Falinks being vertebrates, for starters). Today, they are tentatively placed with other humanoids in Similis, though this classification is controversial. Researchers that do agree with this placement place Falinks closest Sableye, sharing their diminutive stature. Others propose a new genus be created solely for Falinks to account for its uniquely simple body plan and other features compared to the other members of Similis.","","Frosmoth are commonly viewed as the icy cousins of Volcarona; both are hemimetabolic lepidopterans that inhabit areas inhospitable to humans. These Pokémon have puzzled generations of scientists because despite being invertebrates with no form of internal temperature regulation, they clearly inhabit freezing climates with no ill effects. Some believed that Frosmoth may in fact be endotherms, retaining heat with their thick, parka-like fuzz. However, no evidence has been found to support this hypothesis. Recently, researchers have discovered that these Pokémon have an antifreeze-like compound in their bodies that keeps them limber even when chilled below freezing point, though exact details remain to be elucidated.","Frosmoth are commonly viewed as the icy cousins of Volcarona; both are hemimetabolic lepidopterans that inhabit areas inhospitable to humans.

Countless anthropologists have proposed possible explanations for their rituals. Perhaps these Pokémon were built by ancient Galarians for worship or burial purposes, or perhaps they kept time for agricultural harvests. Some even believe Stonjourner have extraterrestrial origins. A recent study has shown that, during their yearly rituals, the very center of a Stonjourner circle contains very bizarre electromagnetic readings that are much higher than the surrounding area. Researchers have coined these centers \"power spots\" in reference to the Dynamax-capable regions of Galar, but their exact function is still unknown. Further studies are stymied by the fact that these rituals only occur once a year, as well as fact that Stonjourner are very protective of their circles and dislike anyone getting inside them.","Naturally, Eiscue are believed to be the closest relatives of Empoleon. Scientists believe that like their cousins, Eiscue were once agile underwater hunters as well. However, their ice blocks now drastically hinder their maneuverability in the water; in fact, it prevents them from submerging entirely due to the difference in density. However, Eiscue make up for this with the possibility of extraordinary long-distance travel; Eiscue can simply float alongside ocean currents to far-off areas without exerting much energy. They can rest on top of floating icebergs and catch prey with their dangling hairs as they continue to travel. This adaptation has given them a far greater range worldwide than Empoleon, as well as greater adaptability to a shifting climate--Eiscue can follow the currents to colder areas if their current habitats warm up.","Indeedee are thought to be close relatives of Audino, based on their similar physical appearances. Both Pokémon are also well-adapted to life with humans; Audino are commonly employed in the health industry, while Indeedee often work in the service industry. Some scientists believe that both are highly-evolved lagomorphs that adapted alongside humans, diverging quite recently to fulfill different niches of human need. Indeed both wild Audino and Indeedee tend to not fare as well as urban individuals by common measures of general health and prosperity, suggesting an evolutionary bias towards human settlements.","Morpeko today are comfortably classified as rodents, much like Greedent, Pachirisu, and Emolga. However, this was not always the case in the past. These Pokémon were the center of a minor controversy when a group of scientists announced that they had genetic evidence that Morpeko resemble rodents merely due to convergent evolution, and that they were not, in fact, close relatives at all. However, intense scrutinization revealed that the genetic evidence the scientists had proposed was insufficient, as they had overestimated the difference between the DNA of Morpeko and that of other rodents. Further analysis revealed a close similarity between the two, decisively ending the controversy.","Unsurprisingly, Copperajah are close relatives of Donphan. They are better suited for tropical jungles and their frequent rainfall than their relatives. These Pokémon are famous for their great intelligence, especially as non-Psychic-types. Herds of Copperajah seem to observe rituals when it comes to births and deaths. When a Copperajah passes, for instance, its fellow herd members will excavate the earth beneath where it died and bury it alongside copper ore. Some argue that because of their aptitude, it is immoral to employ Copperajah in menial labor tasks. However, research into Copperajah cognition is still quite murky and undefined, and some studies have been controversial in both methodology and conclusions.","Unsurprisingly, Copperajah are close relatives of Donphan.

Today, a significant portion of paleontological funds go towards keeping individuals in captivity as comfortable as possible to provide a bit of compensation for resurrecting them in the first place. To fully understand the origin of this mistake, one should know that the first Galarian paleontologists did not unearth any complete fossils. Rather, they had unearthed partial skeletons of some draconians, avians, pinnipeds, and fish. Though they had been incorrectly put together, they did not realize this at the time, and thus they assembled future fossils in a similar way. After resurrection technology arrived, because the revived versions aligned with the belief that these Pokémon were poorly adapted, stubborn scientists persisted in believing that the original models were correct. It was only in the face of overwhelming evidence otherwise that they relented. Today, the story is a parable that warns scientists to keep their minds open to new ideas that may challenge their current beliefs.","To put it simply, these Pokémon are amongst the biggest blunders of scientific history.

Both are in fact placed in the same genus, with their primary difference being Duraludon's metal alloy carapace. Though they share no typings, both Pokémon share a similar physiology, dwell in similar habitats, and require minerals to strengthen their bodies. It is these latter two traits that also make them fierce competitors in the wild, competing over both territory and resources. Duraludon have no pre-evolutions, however, and female Duraludon do not share the maternal instinct that female Tyranitar possess. As parental instinct is thought to be a later development, some scientists believe that Duraludon may more closely resemble the most recent common ancestor the two species had shared (still being after the extinct Tyrantrum), just with an improved carapace.","Dreepy were believed to be ancient amphibians, and while their Ghost-typings may be slightly unusual, this is where scientists still place them today. Ancient Dreepy were likely mostly aquatic, only venturing onto land for short periods of time. Exactly how they arrived at their current forms is still an unanswered question. Whether they truly are the spirits of a deceased species, or simply a striking and drastic evolutionary adaptation is unknown. Naturally, the scientific community leans towards the latter, but evidence is currently lacking in either direction. At the very least, popular media certainly leans towards the former as a more enticing explanation for their Ghost-typings.","Dreepy were believed to be ancient amphibians, and while their Ghost-typings may be slightly unusual, this is where scientists still place them today.

Execuggtor only need sunlight to be perfectly content; they can easily converse with themselves through telepathy for hours on end to keep themselves occupied.","Cubone are timid creatures that have difficulty making social connections. It takes a lot of work to coax these Pokémon into participating in group activities, though the process pays off when they evolve into Marowak that are much more compassionate than their ruthless wild brethren. Wild Marowak are even more difficult to raise, so it is suggested that trainers raise and evolve young Cubone instead if they wish to train these Pokémon.","Cubone are timid creatures that have difficulty making social connections.

They enjoy strict training regimens, and will become anxious if trainers try to let them plan their own schedules. Their evolutions, however, are self-sufficient. Many gyms will gladly allow these Pokémon to practice in their facilities free of charge in exchange for working as trainers or sparring partners.","Trainers should allow their Tyrogue will engage in a variety of different fighting styles so that they can see which they prefer the most.

Though their saliva is naturally antibacterial, infections can result from minor cuts and abrasions on their sensitive tongues; mouthwash is an easy way to combat these afflictions. Very tart, salty, and particularly spicy foods can also overwhelm their taste buds and render them unable to taste anything for a while afterwards.","Koffing and Weezing essentially perform the terrestrial version of filter-feeding, making them very easy to feed. Trainers should keep their Pokémon away from heat sources and open flames, as they will easily ignite the gases that these Pokémon expel and cause them to explode. Rapid changes in temperature make it difficult for them to float comfortably; warm temperatures will cause them to rise suddenly while colder ones will cause them to sink.","Koffing and Weezing essentially perform the terrestrial version of filter-feeding, making them very easy to feed.

Their thick armor prevents them from reacting to its presence quickly, so trainers should keep a close eye on their Pokémon  in wet environments. Rhyhorn cannot turn while charging, so they need plenty of open space while running. Rhyhorn racing tracks have sharp, 90° turns for this reason. Rhyperior need access to exposed stone to provide themselves with ammo for their rock-based attacks.","These Pokémon are notoriously hardy, but are very weak to water.

They should always be allowed to hold Oval Stones or similarly-shaped objects, as they will become upset if they cannot find any.  A stone offered by a Happiny should always be accepted, as refusal is taken as a sign of disrespect. Chansey and Blissey can easily take care of themselves (as well as other Pokémon), but it should be noted that immoral acts greatly upset them.","As with most plant-like Pokémon, both Tangela and Tangrowth need ample water and sunlight to thrive. These Pokémon seem to require much less of either resource than other Grass-types, however. This likely is a result of their carnivorous diets as well as their tendency to stay still for extended periods of time; it is normal for these Pokémon, particularly Tangrowth, to sit patiently in hiding for hours or even days while waiting for prey to pass by.","Infant Kangaskhan imprint upon their mothers upon birth, and will refuse to accept care from anyone other than them. For this reason, orphans are unfortunately difficult to raise. Adult Kangaskhan are self-sufficient. Other than providing them with food, shelter, and some toys for their offspring to play with, they can essentially take care of themselves.","These Pokémon are sensitive to water conditions, particularly to temperature and purity. Polluted or excessively cold water can easily make them ill. Kingdra need very large volumes of water to thrive. These Pokémon all prefer calm waters. Branched corals are also a necessity in their habitats, particularly for Horsea and Seadra, as they will latch onto branches while sleeping and resting. Calcium is particularly important for Seadra in order to keep their spines healthy.","These Pokémon are sensitive to water conditions, particularly to temperature and purity.

They are easy to feed since they eat nearly anything, but particularly prefer algae; for this reason, many professional aquariums house Goldeen in their tanks to help clear away muck from their tanks. Seaking are very active in the autumn during breeding season and will become restless if confined in small spaces during this time.","Goldeen and Seaking are obviously aquatic Pokémon.

These Pokémon thrive in cool waters, but can survive in warmer climates as well. Their cores, though hard, can be shattered; damage to their cores will cause permanent injury or even death. Both Pokémon enjoy basking under the night sky, particularly when the sky is unobscured by clouds.","Though they can survive for periods of time outside of the water, the Staryu family prefers to remain submerged, resting on sandy sea floors or solid rock.

Mime Jr. love candy and will eat it until they get sick; trainers should know that this is obviously not healthy for them and keep sweets in hard-to-reach locations. Ironically, despite often pretending to be trapped in small boxes, Mr. Mime are claustrophobic and greatly dislike actually being confined.","Scyther are naturally pack hunters, but handle isolation better than most other social Pokémon (lone individuals tend to be more aggressive, however). Scizor are solitary by nature and dislike being in large, noisy groups. Both Pokémon prefer to catch live prey but are content with fresh meat. They enjoy honing their hunting skills by chasing down toys or slicing trees, however. Although Scyther can fly, they do not seem to suffer any ill effects if they are unable to do so.","Both Smoochum and Jynx have thin, sensitive skin. They will break out into rashes from mild irritants like dirt, so they try to keep as clean and moisturized as possible. Warm, dry air will quickly dehydrate them and cause their skin to crack. ","As baby Pokémon, Elekid can be a handful at times. They often have short bursts of energy, during which they will spin their arms wildly to charge up. Doing so quickly tires them out, however, and they have to rest immediately afterwards. Electabuzz and Electivire are comparatively low-maintenance. As long as they are provided with a steady source of electricity (usually from a generator), they are largely able to take care of themselves.","Although these Pokémon are able to acclimate to moderate climates with few problems, they should not be brought out in cold weather, which can turn them sluggish and lethargic. They enjoy taking baths in hot lava, so trainers should let them explore near active volcanoes (from a far, safe distance of course) if possible. Magby will expel dull red flames or sooty smoke when they are sick or ill.","Pinsir are not very picky eaters, and have no preference between live prey or prepared carcasses. This makes them relatively easy to feed. However, they do enjoy chasing things down and catching them, so trainers should provide their Pinsir with mobile toys for them to pursue. These Pokémon also dislike the cold and will even hibernate if the temperature remains frigid for too long.","Domesticated Tauros are considerably more docile than their wild brethren, but still possess many of the same characteristics. They require lots of land, both for grazing and for running. They are also herd animals that enjoy being in large groups. Butting heads is normal for these Pokémon and should not be considered, as they enjoy testing their strength against others and even take pride in their wounds.","Taking care of Magikarp is exceedingly easy. Provided with nothing more than algae and a large enough container of water, they would easily survive and even thrive. They are often sold as aquarium fish to young children for this reason (to be released as they approach evolution, of course). Gyarados require huge bodies of water and should only be let out of their Poké Balls in large lakes or oceans. They have no preferences between live or dead prey.","Taking care of Magikarp is exceedingly easy.

Since assembling an entire pod of these Pokémon is a difficult task even for conservationists, trainers should instead allow them to spend time with their other Pokémon; they are amicable and will easily make friends. They dislike large crowds of strangers, however. Though they spend most of their time in cold waters, they do migrate to warmer areas in the spring and can withstand a wide range of temperatures.","Ditto are relatively easy to care for. When they sleep, they turn into rocks, and require nothing at all to sustain themselves. They enjoy learning to transform into new things, and will spend the day wandering about and morphing into whatever they come across. Ditto should be kept in wide open areas until they learn to not transform into anything large or hazardous inside enclosed buildings.","The Eeveelutions are adapted to life alongside humans. Each has their own preferential habitat and climate, which should be made relatively obvious by their typings. It should be noted that each evolution tends to become stressed when removed from their preferred environment, so trainers should take into account where they live before choosing which Pokémon to evolve their Eevee into.","The Eeveelutions are adapted to life alongside humans.

They do not do much and can be slow at responding to commands. Porygon2 are more streamlined, and for the most part are self-sustaining. Porygon-Z can be a danger to themselves when glitching out, so trainers should be prepared to recall them into their Poké Balls if they do so. All members of the line should be returned periodically to their Poké Balls so that they can recharge.","Both Omanyte and Omastar are pelagic Pokémon that require relatively deep water. Though Omanyte are docile and can feasibly be raised in tall tanks, Omastar are rowdier than their pre-evolutions and may break glass with their spikes. When Omastar fire their spikes, they are left with vulnerable holes in their shells. Their exposed flesh is very delicate and prone to infections if injured, so trainers should keep a close watch on these openings.","Both Omanyte and Omastar are pelagic Pokémon that require relatively deep water.

Kabuto like to hide and hate to expose themselves when not feeding, so some sort of substrate is necessary in the habitats of these Pokémon. Kabutops whet their scythes on rocks and other hard objects to keep them as sharp as possible.","Though amphibious in nature, neither of these Pokémon can spend much time out of the water without asphyxiating.

Though they are famed for being vicious hunters, these Pokémon are also quite playful and enjoy spending lots of time with their trainers. They will gladly give rides to smaller Pokémon (once the distinction between “friend” and “food” has been made clear).","Munchlax eat constantly and for this reason require a near-constant supply of food. They can be a drain on the wallet to raise, so trainers on a budget should consider other Pokémon. Snorlax also eat enormous amounts of food, but do so in single sittings while sleeping for as long as a month straight. It takes a lot to wake these slumbering giants, though, so as long as they don’t fall asleep in the middle of a street, they should not cause any problems.","","","","Though all of these Pokémon are naturally found in aquatic environments, they seem to do just fine living solely on land. Both Dratini and Dragonair shed their skin periodically, and hide away after doing so while they are vulnerable. They particularly seem to prefer sheltering themselves behind waterfalls. Dragonite enjoy flying great distances, and will sometimes leave on flights lasting for days simply to stretch their wings.","Though all of these Pokémon are naturally found in aquatic environments, they seem to do just fine living solely on land.

Individuals deprived of sunlight may begin to act sluggish and emit weaker fragrances, while the leaves and flowers of those that are parched may begin to wilt. These Pokémon dislike cold weather, likely due to being both Grass-types and saurians. Chikorita in particular do not do well in arid climates with low humidity.","As Grass-types, all members of this family thrive with ample exposure to sunlight and generous amounts of water.

Unlike many other Water-types, they can survive for long periods of time outside of the water with no ill effects, though they do enjoy swimming over walking. Totodile are voracious eaters that consume lots of food to supply them with energy, but their metabolisms slow down as they evolve; Feraligatr can go for over a week without food after large meals.","Members of this family are very hardy and require little care from humans.

More importantly, they are intensely social and will behave abnormally, sometimes at the cost of their own health, when separated from their groups. It is recommended that trainers raise young Sentret that do not yet have social ties, so that their “groups” will consist of their trainers and fellow Pokémon. Furret clean their fur frequently and need access to clean water in order to do so.","Sentret are meek Pokémon that dislike unfamiliarity.

They dislike bright light in general, including the light of the sun. Traveling by plane or other modes of transportation that may induce “jet lag” in people can also distress these Pokémon, disrupting their internal clocks. Though they are quick to adjust, prolonged stress in this form can make them physically ill.","Because these Pokémon are nocturnal, trainers should not try to disturb them during the day while they are sleeping.

They are unusually quick in becoming accustomed to new social groups, however, provided they are kept happy and healthy. Ledyba are diurnal, but prefer to sleep with their backs facing the starry night sky. In contrast, Ledian are nocturnal and enjoy flying about in the starlight.","Both Ledyba and Ledian are social Pokémon, and will be distressed when removed from their swarms; Ledyba in particular may stop eating and sleeping when isolated.

Spinarak will consume basically anything edible that becomes trapped in their webs, while Ariados will eat any meat they can find as long as it is fresh. Ariados are territorial, but do not mind the presence of other Ariados. Trainers should leave nooks and crannies open for their Spinarak to construct webs, even if they aren’t likely to catch prey, to keep them satisfied.","Spinarak and Ariados both are active at night.

However, Zubat in particular can be harmed by prolonged exposure to sunlight, which can damage their thin skin. Golbat also dislike metal, while both Golbat and Crobat despise Durin Berries for unknown reasons. Golbat are content sucking blood from carcasses, and as such are surprisingly easy to feed. Crobat cannot land on the ground and need branches or other elevated structures in order to perch. Golbat may break their fangs when trying to bite sharp objects, but the fangs will grow back over time.","Though Chinchou can swim in open water, they prefer to keep both of their feet-like fins on a solid surface. They are more comfortable on land than most other Water-types and are often content with simply a small wading pool to keep themselves moist. Lanturn, on the other hand, require large volumes of water to swim freely. They naturally form pods with other Lanturn in the wild, but will readily school with other Pokémon in captivity.","Though Chinchou can swim in open water, they prefer to keep both of their feet-like fins on a solid surface.

Pikachu and Raichu have more control over their electrical abilities, however, and as such are easier to care for. They are social Pokémon that, while timid at first, can easily adapt to life with humans. Beginning trainers sometimes choose Pikachu as their starter Pokémon for this reason.","The Cleffa line is incredibly shy and dislike being in crowded situations. For this reason, trainers should not take their Pokémon into urban towns and cities outside of their Poké Balls. Cleffa enjoy dancing during and after meteor showers, while Clefairy and Clefable do the same during full moons. They should not be interrupted during their astronomical rituals, because they will become anxious if they cannot complete them correctly. As rare but timid Pok","Wigglytuff fur is hypoallergenic, a plus for trainers with allergies. Wigglytuff themselves, though, are sensitive to dust, which can irritate their huge eyes. Igglybuff and Jigglypuff can be blown about by strong winds, so they should remain indoors in rough weather. Igglypuff have weak vocal cords, but will continue to practice singing even when sore; their trainers should intervene when this happens to give them time to recover. Jigglypuff also may not stop singing when faced with foes they cannot put to sleep; trainers should be ready to stop them in this event. Since they enjoy being around people, they are excellent choices for urban trainers.","Togepi imprint on the first living thing they see, and for this reason can only be raised by trainers that have hatched them from eggs. They are very needy as baby Pokémon, and have to be fed and soothed often; their shells are also fragile and can crack from rough handling. All members of this line greatly dislike anger and hostility. Being trapped around these emotions greatly distresses them. Togekiss are clumsy on the ground and require plenty of open air to fly around freely.","Togepi imprint on the first living thing they see, and for this reason can only be raised by trainers that have hatched them from eggs.

They are both also deathly afraid of water and cannot tolerate even minute amounts of the substance. When Bonsly cry, they are actually expelling excess liquid from their bodies and are not actually (usually) upset. Even high humidity can disturb these Pokémon. Naturally, they should be kept inside at all times during rainy weather. ","All members of the Poliwag family must keep their skin moist at all times, as they will suffocate if it dries out. Poliwag are clumsy on land and will stumble often. so trainers should keep a close eye on them out of the water. Poliwrath enjoy practicing their swimming technique, so trainers should take them out to large lakes often. Poliwag, Poliwhirl, and Poliwrath are entranced by the sound of Politoed croaking; trainers should recall their Pokémon if they hear the distinct sound.","These Pokémon thrive in breezy weather and cannot travel well without wind. For this reason, they do not do well indoors unless the rooms are well-ventilated or there are many fans in place. Strong winds carry the danger of blowing these light Pokémon away. Hoppip and Skiploom also require sunlight to photosynthesize. They prefer warm climates to cooler ones.

Since these Yanmega are not at all fickle when it comes to food, they will be satisfied with fresh meat as opposed to live prey. They particularly enjoy being tossed their meals so that they can catch them in the air with their powerful jaws.","Both of these Pokémon are amphibious and need to keep themselves moist in order to survive. Both prefer cool, but not freezing water; Wooper can actually tolerate a wider range of temperatures than their evolutions. They are not exceptional swimmers and cannot fight strong currents well, and for this reason prefer stagnant or slow-moving bodies of water. Wooper like to bury themselves in sand underwater when frightened.","Both of these Pokémon are amphibious and need to keep themselves moist in order to survive.

Wooper like to bury themselves in sand underwater when frightened.","The Eeveelutions are adapted to life alongside humans. Each has their own preferential habitat and climate, which should be made relatively obvious by their typings. It should be noted that each evolution tends to become stressed when removed from their preferred environment, so trainers should take into account where they live before choosing which Pokémon to evolve their Eevee into.","The Eeveelutions are adapted to life alongside humans.

They seem to enjoy being alone, however, especially when freed from the strict orders of an unforgiving Honchkrow. Both Murkrow and Honchkrow are active in the darkness. Murkrow enjoy hunting for and collecting shiny things, while Honchkrow dislike doing work themselves and will try to command other Pokémon to work for them.","Slowpoke and Slowbro are not active Pokémon, are are content lounging around doing absolutely nothing. They prefer being near water, but will not be stressed if placed in drier environments. Slowking similarly do not need much physical simulation. However, they are intensely intellectual and philosophical. Books and movies will keep their minds active; they are even known to stare at paintings for hours on end in order to decipher meaning in the artwork.","Neither of these Pokémon can stand light, becoming dull and immobile when exposed to it. They are nocturnal and are only active once the sun sets. Large cities are not ideal places to raise Misdreavus and Mismagius because of the abundance of street lamps and other light sources. Like their relatives Banette, trained individuals can be taught to feed on positive emotions like happiness instead of negative ones like fear.","Unown are naturally found in large swarms in the wild. They do just fine alone when captured, however; it should be noted that lone Unown are weak and unremarkable in terms of battling capabilities. They enjoy spending most of their time attached to flat surfaces such as walls. Most trainers should not have a problem with raising multiple Unown; their reality-bending effects only become apparently when swarms approach the late hundreds in number.","Both of these Pokémon are incredibly easy to take care of. Wobbuffet are especially so, as they prefer to be alone. They are perfectly happy if left unattended in a dark room with an ample supply of Berries. Wynaut are more social Pokémon that like being in large groups. They can get a bit rough when playing, however, and should be kept away from more fragile Pokémon (and children). They also enjoy the darkness, but do not detest light like Wobbuffet.","Girafarig are not the easiest Pokémon for novice trainers to take care of. They are rather easily spooked, causing them to run away or defend themselves with Psychic-type attacks. Their rear heads also can be very dangerous, as they will attack anything unfamiliar that comes too near. Once they become accustomed to their trainers’ scents, however, they will stop lashing out at them. Girafarig are comfortable both in herds as well as alone.","Pineco are relatively self-sufficient; they will adhere to any tree with sufficient leaf coverage and proceed to surround themselves with bark and resin, feeding themselves by capturing insects. Foretress are a bit harder to care for as they cannot produce their own resin, but spreading Honey near them is sufficient to attract bugs for them; they are hardier than Pineco and can not only withstand harsher weather conditions, but also go for longer without a meal.","Pineco are relatively self-sufficient; they will adhere to any tree with sufficient leaf coverage and proceed to surround themselves with bark and resin, feeding themselves by capturing insects.

They also seem to prefer moist environments, though they can survive in drier ones as well. Dunsparce rest and hide in subterranean burrows, so the floor of their habitats should be composed of soil or soft clay. They are sensitive to vibrations, so they shouldn’t be kept close to highways or other places where the ground often shakes.","Gligar jump from high places in order to glide, so trainers should provide them with plenty of perches. They tend to be more active during the night, but can remain active during the day; Gliscor, on the other hand, are strictly nocturnal and like to hide in dark places until the sun sets. They need lots of open space to fly and should be let outside during the night. Trainers should contact their local Pokémon League branch to discuss their Pokémon’s feeding routines.","These Pokémon are rather clumsy aboveground, as their bodies are adapted to tunneling through solid earth. They will leave large holes in the ground as they burrow, which can be freely used by other subterranean Pokémon. These Pokémon should be kept away from magnets, which can disrupt the magnetic organs in their heads. Onix are particularly weak to water and stay away from the substance at all costs.","Snubbull and Granbull are well-suited to domestic life, so most trainers should have little trouble caring for them. They enjoy playing with people and Pokémon. Both are easily scared, however, and should be kept out of tense situations. Many people mistakenly believe that Snubbull require lots of attention and are very fickle, and the media portrays them as Pokémon for the wealthy. In reality, most Snubbull are perfectly happy as long as they are loved and cared for.","Snubbull and Granbull are well-suited to domestic life, so most trainers should have little trouble caring for them.

In reality, most Snubbull are perfectly happy as long as they are loved and cared for.","These Pokémon are pelagic and require large amounts of open water. Currents are their worst enemy, as they are unable to fight against even moderate flows of water. Because of this, most traditional tank filters cannot be used, as they produce currents that are too strong for Qwilfish. Manual cleaning is generally necessary; these Pokémon should be recalled during cleanings to prevent accidents with their spines. As one may have guessed, Qwilfish are not recommended for novices.","Scyther are naturally pack hunters, but handle isolation better than most other social Pokémon (lone individuals tend to be more aggressive, however). Scizor are solitary by nature and dislike being in large, noisy groups. Both Pokémon prefer to catch live prey but are content with fresh meat. They enjoy honing their hunting skills by chasing down toys or slicing trees, however. Although Scyther can fly, they do not seem to suffer any ill effects if they are unable to do so.","Shuckle are very hardy, thanks to their incredibly tough shells. They require a damp environment, many rocks to hide in, and easy access to Berries; other than these conditions, they can endure practically any other issues by hiding in their shells. Individual Shuckle have their own preferences as to what Berries they enjoy most, but no known Berries are known to harm or even turn off a hungry Shuckle.","Despite their large size, Heracross are relatively easy to care for. They are very benign and easy to feed, as Combee Honey can be bought at most Poké Marts. Around mating season, however, these Pokémon can get a bit restless, even if no suitable mates are around. Trainers should let their Pokémon duel other Heracross or at least participate more often in battles to work off their extra energy.","Sneasel live and hunt in pairs (which notably can be either mixed- or same-gendered), and Weavile do so in packs. As such, they are social creatures, despite their ruthlessness in hunting. They will become agitated when isolated for long periods of time, so trainers should let them spend plenty of time with other Pokémon. Because of their sharp claws, however, it is advised to keep them alongside hardier species. Sneasel in particular will form close bonds with a single partner.","Teddiursa are very mild-mannered, oftentimes oblivious to their surroundings. They often focus their attention on Honey, failing to notice potential dangers around them. Some believe that this may be why Ursaring parents are so protective of their offspring. Ursaring themselves, on the other hand, can for the most part take care of themselves. Unusually cold weather makes them sluggish and can trigger their body to prepare for hibernation, however.","Teddiursa are very mild-mannered, oftentimes oblivious to their surroundings.

Poké Marts carry a more temperature-safe, nontoxic magma substitute that can slowly be introduced into these Pokémon so that they no longer harden at cooler temperatures. Though it is still very hot, it will also allow them to travel on hard ground without immediately combusting whatever is beneath them.","Slugma and Magcargo are most at home in very warm climates; even the warmest areas inhabitable by humans, however, are normally not hot enough for them.

Individuals kept even in temperate climates should have their coats trimmed to prevent overheating. Mamoswine tusks are made of ice and will melt when exposed to moderate heat. They are difficult Pokémon to raise outside of arctic environments, but can be trained to chill the air around them to keep their tusks from melting, though doing so for a while will tire them out.","Because of their thick coats, these Pokémon fare very poorly in warm environments.

These Pokémon are very social, as one would guess from their colony-forming habits. They also fickle regarding water temperature, salinity, purity, and even sunlight--although they aren’t plants, Corsola become frail and weak when deprived of natural sunlight. Most notably, their horns will fade to a pale white if left in darkness before being treated.","Trainers should not try to raise young Remoraid, who either rely on a Mantine host or a large school (usually around a growing Mantyke) for protection and food. Older Remoraid, though, are very easy to raise; they don’t school and can easily be fed, catching insects flying or resting above the water. Octillery are content hiding in rocks or underwater pots. They are territorial and enjoy being left alone, although they seem to have fun solving puzzles and playing with toys.","Trainers should not try to raise young Remoraid, who either rely on a Mantine host or a large school (usually around a growing Mantyke) for protection and food.

However, they can survive in a wide range of climates, an adaptation that was necessary to allow them to travel as far as they do to gather food. Even when food is abundant, Delibird instinctually try to stuff their tails as full as possible when they come across it, so trainers should adjust feeding schedules accordingly to account for stored food.​","Mantine are not recommended for most beginning or even intermediate trainers; these large, aquatic creatures require vast amounts of open water in order to swim freely. Mantyke are considerably easier, but can be quite a handful because of how playful they are. Although they can be raised without Remoraid, trainers should never separate a Remoraid and a Mantyke or Mantine that have already bonded; doing so would induce great distress in both Pokémon.","It is surprisingly easy to placate a Skarmory; they will refrain from attacking those that give them food, seemingly knowing to not bite the hand that feeds them. Earning one’s trust and respect, however, is another matter. These Pokémon will only obey the orders of those that prove to be tougher than them in battle. Once their loyalty is earned, though, Skarmory are very dependable allies even in the face of imminent danger. They should be kept from water, which can rust them.","Houndour should not be confused with Growlithe or Lillipup; they are feral by nature with the same distrust towards humans as most other wild Pokémon. They are pack creatures that cannot survive on their own. Houndoom fare a bit better in solitude, but lone individuals are much more irritable and ill-tempered. Trainers with happy Houndour and Houndoom have taught them to view other Pokémon as “pack members,” who they will defend with all of their might.","Houndour should not be confused with Growlithe or Lillipup; they are feral by nature with the same distrust towards humans as most other wild Pokémon.

Polluted or excessively cold water can easily make them ill. Kingdra need very large volumes of water to thrive. These Pokémon all prefer calm waters. Branched corals are also a necessity in their habitats, particularly for Horsea and Seadra, as they will latch onto branches while sleeping and resting. Calcium is particularly important for Seadra in order to keep their spines healthy.","Large, open spaces are a necessity for these Pokémon. Donphan mainly travel through rolling and cannot stop easily, so they need plenty of room to gradually decelerate. Phanpy love to charge about and similarly should not be kept in cramped areas. They generally fare well with other Pokémon; Phanpy in particular enjoy company. However, they should be kept away from fragile species because they play rough and can easily injure frailer Pokémon.","Large, open spaces are a necessity for these Pokémon.

They do not do much and can be slow at responding to commands. Porygon2 are more streamlined, and for the most part are self-sustaining. Porygon-Z can be a danger to themselves when glitching out, so trainers should be prepared to recall them into their Poké Balls if they do so. All members of the line should be returned periodically to their Poké Balls so that they can recharge.","These Pokémon herd by nature, so it can be difficult to raise a single one. Young Stantler are particularly skittish if separated from their herds, while older ones are less easily scared. They will become more docile and calm once they get used to their surroundings. New situations, though, will often spook them, so only skilled trainers should attempt to raise them if they are planning to travel around the region. ","Smeargle are at home in urban environments and make great Pokémon for metropolitan trainers. They can keep themselves occupied for days at a time with nothing more than Berries, water, and a few canvasses. Smeargle love teaching people and Pokemon how to paint, though they may get irritated at those who are slow to catch on. Trainers should take them out to art museums or even just to visit other Smeargle--they may be inspired to paint something along the way.","Trainers should allow their Tyrogue will engage in a variety of different fighting styles so that they can see which they prefer the most. They enjoy strict training regimens, and will become anxious if trainers try to let them plan their own schedules. Their evolutions, however, are self-sufficient. Many gyms will gladly allow these Pokémon to practice in their facilities free of charge in exchange for working as trainers or sparring partners.","Trainers should allow their Tyrogue will engage in a variety of different fighting styles so that they can see which they prefer the most.

They will break out into rashes from mild irritants like dirt, so they try to keep as clean and moisturized as possible. Warm, dry air will quickly dehydrate them and cause their skin to crack. ","As baby Pokémon, Elekid can be a handful at times. They often have short bursts of energy, during which they will spin their arms wildly to charge up. Doing so quickly tires them out, however, and they have to rest immediately afterwards. Electabuzz and Electivire are comparatively low-maintenance. As long as they are provided with a steady source of electricity (usually from a generator), they are largely able to take care of themselves.","Although these Pokémon are able to acclimate to moderate climates with few problems, they should not be brought out in cold weather, which can turn them sluggish and lethargic. They enjoy taking baths in hot lava, so trainers should let them explore near active volcanoes (from a far, safe distance of course) if possible. Magby will expel dull red flames or sooty smoke when they are sick or ill.","As domesticated Pokémon, Miltank are incredibly easy for even beginning trainers to raise. They are friendly towards humans, often sharing their milk with them. Miltank also seem to have instinctual maternal instincts that make them protective of young children and Pokémon. Though they naturally form herds, many trainers or even families raise lone Miltank without much difficulty of stress on the Pokémon.","","","","","This family of Pokémon is not at all recommended for beginning trainers. Larvitar eat almost constantly, and require ludicrous amounts of dirt to be satiated. This usually is a very costly endeavor. Pupitar are thankfully easy to care for, though they are surprisingly mobile. Tyranitar are very aggressive towards strangers; it takes a skilled trainer to restrain them from lashing out against foreign people and Pokémon.","This family of Pokémon is not at all recommended for beginning trainers.

They are laid-back in personality, comfortable in temperate to warm climates, and easy to feed for most trainers. They do dislike the cold and can become ill if deprived of sunlight for extended periods of time, but otherwise are hardy enough to survive in most conditions.","Treecko and its evolutions are regarded as the easiest of all of the Hoenn starters to raise, if not one of the asiest Pokémon in the region to train in general.

They are also afraid of the dark and of sleeping alone. Combusken discipline themselves with strict training regimens, which trainers should respect (even if it means being woken up at the crack of dawn). Blaziken burn out their feathers periodically, and should be kept out of battle until they grow back so they do not overheat.","Torchic can be a handful to raise; they are clumsy and often hurt themselves in accidents.

Trainers who catch Mightyena must prove their dominance in battle, and continue to maintain it by eating first and asserting control in everyday tasks. Poochyena are far easier to train; offering them food is usually enough to earn their loyalty. Both Pokémon are very playful, though, and very much enjoy running around and roughhousing with their trainers.","Poochyena and Mightyena are pack Pokémon that operate with a hierarchy of leadership.

They are easy to care for and can easily adapt to life with humans. They can seem scatter-brained at first because of how easily distracted they are by their surroundings, but trainers quickly learn that they are just very curious, and usually let them fully explore what is around them. Linoone have great difficulty turning, so trainers should not walk with them on curved roads; they will likely crash very often.","Zigzagoon are good choices for beginning trainers.

Cascoon and Silcoon are even lower-maintenance, as they don’t even eat (though they may drink). Beautifly love to flit about in fields of flowers, but are very aggressive towards other Beautifly and should be kept far away from them.

Breloom also prefer the shade, but are not as intolerant of light as Shroomish. They are surprisingly self-sufficient and low-maintenance, and seem to be content as long as they have enough food to eat.","Although they naturally form colonies, these Pokémon fare surprisingly well alone. Slakoth are inactive creatures that don’t require much attention at all. Vigoroth, though, can be very stressful to raise; they never stop moving, so trainers should occupy their time with as many games and sports as possible. Slaking require enormous amounts of food, but like Slakoth, otherwise don’t do much other than laze around.","Although they naturally form colonies, these Pokémon fare surprisingly well alone.

Nincada are subterranean and can’t tolerate light. Ninjask are very difficult to train, refusing orders until their trainers prove worthy of their loyalty. They will challenge them to races and obstacle courses to test their agility; trainers will have to use their wit to outsmart their Ninjask, as beating them in speed is out of the question. Shedinja are actually easy to care for, but most trainers find them too unsettling after some time.","These Pokémon are not recommended for beginners.

They become dangerously loud when upset, and are difficult to calm down once they begin crying. Covering their ear holes will stop their wailing while still allowing them to breathe through their mouths. Loudred are rambunctious, though not intentionally difficult. Exploud are surprisingly well-mannered, given their appearance.

The largest hurdle trainers must face is maintaining their strict, large diets. They are very particular about what goes into their bodies, and consume a lot of what they do eat. Nuts and fish are good choices, but rich stews and soups may be more economical for cash-strapped trainers.","Both of these Pokémon are relatively easy to care for; they spend most of their time training and can easily adapt to a wide variety of temperatures and climates thanks to their thick, insulating fat.

They are prone to crying easily, particularly when frightened or hungry. Marill and Azumarill require diets high in oily fish in order to maintain their water-repellant fur and buoyant tails. They are also sensitive to high-pitched or loud sounds because of their delicate senses of hearing.","These Pokémon don’t require much attention; they barely move or react to anything. Nosepass are content as long as they are around enough iron to eat. Probopass seem a bit more responsive to care. They may play games of “tag” with small children using their Mini-Noses. Sometimes, unwanted metal objects may get stuck in their mustaches, and trainers may have to use quite a bit of force to pull them out. Electronics tend to malfunction around these creatures.","Skitty are very playful Pokémon that quickly become downcast if their trainers refuse to play with them. Their curiosity can get them into danger sometimes when they follow moving cars down the street, so trainers should keep a close eye on them. Delcatty aren’t so much “trained” as much as “accompanied;” obedience doesn’t seem to be a concept that these Pokémon understand. Expect to spend a significant amount of money on food and comfort when raising Delcatty.","Skitty are very playful Pokémon that quickly become downcast if their trainers refuse to play with them.

They are less expensive to feed than one may think; industrial-grade minerals are enough to satisfy these Pokémon. They are very playful creatures that will get bored quickly without sufficient stimulation, resorting to messing with furniture and personal belongings. Puzzles and building blocks are recommended toys, though trainers shouldn’t expect their Sableye to use them as they were intended.","Trained Mawile are actually rather docile creatures. Some even describe them as shy or timid around strangers. Although they usually hunt live prey, they will eat Berries, prepared meat, or most other foods that their trainers provide for them. Tin cans and scrap metal provide useful metals and minerals for these Pokémon to strengthen their horns with. They dislike being around rowdy Pokémon like Ludicolo or Loudred.","This family is hardy in nature, making it a good choice for trainers who are hesitant about raising more delicate Pokémon. It is crucial to keep Aron well-fed, as they will begin to eat away at iron around the house and nearby streets when hungry. Lairon can be confrontational, especially when they see another Lairon; trainer should know when to recall their Pokémon in tense situations. Aggron are more or less self-sufficient as long as they have enough iron to eat.","This family is hardy in nature, making it a good choice for trainers who are hesitant about raising more delicate Pokémon.

Meditite have a harder time during training, though, and can lose focus in loud and noisy environments. Because of this, urban trainers should find quiet dojos or other places their Pokémon can train in peace. Medicham, having practiced their concentration, can train even in disruptive situations with ease.","Both Meditite and Medicham maintain strict training regimens to test both their spiritual and physical limits.

They are less docile than the likes of Lillipup, though, so trainers should not underestimate the effort it takes to raise them. These Pokémon love static electricity and will rub themselves against carpeted surfaces to charge up. They also love being brushed, but because they store electricity in their manes, trainers should not use metal brushes that can conduct a current through them.","Like many other canines, Electrike adapts unusually well to life with humans.

Under no circumstances should a trainer catch only one of these Pokémon if they come across a pair in the wild; once partnered, a duo will never separate; they will become severely depressed if parted. Minun dislike water for some unknown reason (though Plusle seem unfazed by it). They love to cheer on their teammates in battles.","A Plusle will fare best when trained alongside a Minun, and vice versa.

Without Illumise pheromones to entrance them, trained Volbeat act quite a bit differently than their wild counterparts, pursuing activities other than practicing their displays. They will revert to their usual behavior when they come across Illumise, however.

Although they are easy to feed, they are also thorny and toxic; Roselia in particular may accidentally stab their trainers with the thorns on their heads. Budew are sensitive to changes in weather, closing their buds in the cold and opening them in warmth. Multiple rapid changes in temperature, such as when entering and exiting temperature-controlled buildings, can throw off their bodily functions.","Neither Swalot nor Gulpin are suitable for anyone but the most experienced, daring trainers. Their poisonous natures and indiscriminate diets make them a danger to both life and property around them; they can quite literally eat a trainer out of house and home. A “balanced diet” isn’t a necessity for these Pokémon. Other than food, however, they don’t seem to require any other kind of care at all to thrive.","Neither Swalot nor Gulpin are suitable for anyone but the most experienced, daring trainers.

The scent of blood may still excite them, though. Trained Sharpedo also are a far cry from their wild counterparts, being considerably less aggressive. Trainers should note that while Carvanha are freshwater Pokémon, Sharpedo are marine ones. Carvanha swim into the sea just before evolution, so trainers should prepare for this once they notice their Carvanha becoming restless.","Although vicious in the wild, lone Carvanha are surprisingly meek in captivity.

Water and rain can cool the magma in their humps, making them sluggish and lethargic. Numel hate being hungry and will not respond to commands until they are fed. Camerupt humps will occasionally erupt on their own; this is normal. The humps will begin to shudder and pulsate before an eruption, signaling for their trainers to prepare.","Both of these Pokémon can utilize magma substitute like Slugma and Magcargo, allowing them to dwell away from volcanoes.

It is even more closely related to the similarly-terrestrial Torterra. These Pokémon are also some of the most long-lived of all known so far, with many individuals surpassing a century in age. Torkoal are notable for their diets of solely coal, which they store in their hollow shells. As such, their presence on a mountain is a surefire indicator of the precious substance. Mining operations have severely endangered the well-being of slow-moving Torkoal, who cannot easily relocate to new mountains once humans drain their current ones of coal.","Under no circumstances should a Spoink be put in a situation where it is unable to bounce; their hearts pump in tandem with their leaps, and stopping them can result in death. Spoink are also very protective of their pearls and will become stressed if they lose them. Trainers can calm them down slightly with other round objects to use temporarily, but they won’t settle down completely until they find new pearls. Grumpig are mostly self-sufficient and can take care of themselves.","Under no circumstances should a Spoink be put in a situation where it is unable to bounce; their hearts pump in tandem with their leaps, and stopping them can result in death.

Although they may enjoy fermented Berries and fruits, trainers should be very cautious when feeding such food to their Pokémon; the alcohol content can inebriate these Pokémon so much that they will not even be able to stand. Spinda enjoy dancing once the sun sets, especially in large groups. While this dancing may seem to tire them out, it is a normal practice that wild Spinda engage in routinely.","Trapinch prefer to remain buried in the sand until evolution, so trainers should be prepared to accommodate for a large, dry sand pit when raising one. They may need some help righting themselves if they tip over headfirst. These Pokémon are adapted to arid climates and as such fair best in dry weather. Vibrava don’t fly very high or far, but Flygon do need quite a bit of room in order to fly freely.","Trapinch prefer to remain buried in the sand until evolution, so trainers should be prepared to accommodate for a large, dry sand pit when raising one.

Although they are Grass-types that can root themselves into soil for nutrients, they are still ultimately hunters that require prey for survival. In fact, seeing these Pokémon use Ingrain is a sign that they are malnourished.

They are distant even towards those that they care about. Trainers should know, however, that they will fiercely defend their loved ones if they are ever threatened. Zangoose need to sharpen their claws routinely in order to keep them in peak condition. Hard rocks will suffice for this purpose, though sharpening stones meant for knives are often a better option.","Seviper are ectotherms that dislike cold weather, as low temperatures make them sluggish. They require rocks or sharpening stones to whet their tails on, as they must keep their scythe-like tails sharp in order to wield them properly. Seviper also shed their skins frequently and are briefly vulnerable after they do so. They recover much more quickly than most other shedding Pokémon, sometimes as quickly as in an hour or so, but prefer to hide in bushes or rocks during this time.","These Pokémon don’t seem to require much care at all from people. Their lives revolve around their respective celestial bodies, which trainers cannot control; Solrock “power down” at sunset, while Lunatone do the same during new moons as well as during the day. Sunlamps are not sufficient substitutes for the former. Obviously, keeping these Pokémon indoors during their respective hours is a poor idea that will greatly agitate them.","These Pokémon don’t seem to require much care at all from people.

They cannot tolerate excessively dirty water, however; acid rain in cities can make them ill. They also cannot change their form to suit non-hydrological weather--most notably, they are ill-suited to desert sandstorms, as they cannot recreate particles of dust or sand as they can steam, water,  or ice.","Kecleon are a temperate species that dislike cold weather. Other than that, however, they are rather easy to care for; they spend most of their time standing still waiting for prey to pass them by.

Trainers should familiarize themselves with their Kecleon’s coloration and mood, the connections between which varies among individuals.","Shuppet are a nocturnal species that detest light. Banette can tolerate sunlight more so than their pre-evolutions, but still dislike it. Trainers should train their Pokémon to feed on positive rather than negative emotions; however, some may find it beneficial to have these Pokémon around when feeling jealous or vengeful, as they may find that their grudges fade away as Shuppet and Banette feed on their envy.","Shuppet are a nocturnal species that detest light.

Without enough of either of these, their leaves will wilt, rendering them unable to fly, and their fruit will grow small and bitter. They also need lots of room to fly properly and will become anxious if kept in small quarters for too long. Provided these resources, however, Tropius are very friendly and easily-trained Pokémon.","Chingling and Chimecho both thrive in areas with consistent, gentle breezes. An electric fan will suffice for individuals that are kept indoors. These Pokémon cannot fly without wind, but can be blown away by strong gusts because of their light weight. Because of this, trainers should keep a close eye on their Pokémon when the weather changes. Chimecho like to attach themselves to sturdy branches and overhangs when the wind picks up.","These solitary Pokémon may seem distant and aloof the most trainers. they don’t outwardly express affection like most other Pokémon. They are fiercely loyal creatures that will defend their loved ones when in crisis, however. When Absol become restless and seem to be trying to get their trainers to leave, it is likely that a natural disaster is imminent. Trainers should notify authorities immediately if they see their Absol behaving oddly.","Both of these Pokémon are incredibly easy to take care of. Wobbuffet are especially so, as they prefer to be alone. They are perfectly happy if left unattended in a dark room with an ample supply of Berries. Wynaut are more social Pokémon that like being in large groups. They can get a bit rough when playing, however, and should be kept away from more fragile Pokémon (and children). They also enjoy the darkness, but do not detest light like Wobbuffet.","All members of this family thrive in subzero temperatures. They can survive for some time in warmer climates; Snorunt in particular can dwell even in direct sunlight as long as there is still unmelted snow (or ice, which may be more convenient for trainers) on the ground. Froslass and Glalie are more resilient to heat, but should be covered in ice periodically in order to keep their body temperatures low.","All members of this family thrive in subzero temperatures.

If raising a sole individual, it is best to keep it in the company of other, non-predatory Water-type Pokémon. They prefer warm, clean water with plenty of crevices to hide in. These Pokémon love being around displays of romantic affection, even those between other species. Since these Pokémon are usually raised for their scales, it should be noted that they usually shed in the fall.","Bagon require more than anything else high ledges to jump from; they will search for such areas before even looking for food or water. Hardy Shelgon can survive in most habitats, but they should be kept away from deep water. Salamence, though famously territorial, are surpisingly easy to keep happy in captivity. As long as they have access to an open sky to soar through, they are content spending their hours aloft in the wind.","Bagon require more than anything else high ledges to jump from; they will search for such areas before even looking for food or water.

They mellow out a bit upon evolution into Metang, who prefer to remain aloof even to their trainers. Metagross are self-sufficient, but will not listen to trainers who they consider excessively dim. These Pokémon should be kept away from strong magnets, which can disrupt their movement, health, and even thinking. Beldum do seem to be calmed by the presence of weak magnets, however.","Beldum are not the easiest Pokémon to raise; they seem to act erratically, lashing out with little warning.

They don’t need to eat, as they can thrive on only sunlight and water. Grotle and Torterra are herbivorous, but similarly are easy to raise. Clean water is a necessity when training these Pokémon. If the flora on their bodies begin to wilt, it is a sign that they are ill or malnourished. To keep wild Pokémon from nesting on their Torterra, trainers should hang reflective strips or loud chimes from the trees on their backs.","Turtwig are mild-mannered Pokémon that are rather easy to care for.

They will leap around branches and rocks in the wild, or across tables and desks in a home. Monferno and Infernape are less rambunctious, but still love playing with others. Monferno like to spar with other Pokémon to train, while Infernape prefer to practice their martial arts in solitude, often against trees or mountain faces.","Chimchar are energetic Pokémon that enjoy moving around, whether alone or in the company of others.

They refuse to accept care from others, so trainers must go to great lengths to make them think they are taking care of themselves. Naturalistic feeding tanks stocked with live fish, for instance, are a must for these Pokémon, who prefer to catch their own food. They do not fare well in warm climates, as they are adapted to icy conditions.","","","Although they naturally form flocks in the wild, both Starly and Staravia fare rather well in solitude. They are easy to care for and seem unfazed by the bustle of large cities. Trainers should be aware that Staravia raised alone can become aggressive when around others of their kind. Staraptor preen their combs meticulously and need a source of clean, fresh water to periodically rinse their feathers.","Although they naturally form flocks in the wild, both Starly and Staravia fare rather well in solitude.

They are surprisingly hardy and can tolerate a wide range of climates as long as they are near fresh water. These Pokémon spend their whole days working; they will become very anxious if they are left with nothing to do. In areas where felling trees and building dams is implausible, Bidoof and Bibarel can be kept busy with building blocks or even simple yard work (they can trim bushes with their teeth, for instance).","Both of these Pokémon are relatively easy to care for.

Although they are easy to feed, they are also thorny and toxic; Roselia in particular may accidentally stab their trainers with the thorns on their heads. Budew are sensitive to changes in weather, closing their buds in the cold and opening them in warmth. Multiple rapid changes in temperature, such as when entering and exiting temperature-controlled buildings, can throw off their bodily functions.","These petite Pokémon are not well-suited for beginning trainers.

They will charge at a moment’s notice, and while they almost never hurt themselves in the process, they can severely damage property or other beings. They are not necessarily disobedient, but seem to have a hard time understanding even moderately complex commands.

They are also docile, even around humans, and are easy to feed. Shieldon are shier than their evolutions and dislike vast, open spaces where they have nowhere to hide. They also enjoy polishing their face plates with leaves.","Many trainers find that both of these Pokémon are very easy to care for; they are sturdy and tolerant of both temperate and tropical climates (though they very much dislike the cold), for instance.

Female Combee fare much better in solitude, as they can evolve into Vespiquen (who by nature are never around other Vespiquen). Unless one wishes to farm Honey, one should not let their Vespiquen start new hives; this can be achieved by primarily feeding them nectar rather than Honey (though Honey can still be an occasional treat).","Male Combee find themselves distressingly without purpose when isolated, so they should be at least raised in small groups.

They love to climb tall things, so trainers should provide them with climbing structures to prevent them from scaling furniture or even telephone poles. Even when food is plentiful, Pachirisu instinctively feel the need to hoard nuts and Berries in caches. By providing them with easily-accessible “hiding spots,” trainers can easily monitor and manage these stashes.","Buizel are surprisingly easy to raise even for novice trainers. Though they prefer rapid rivers, they can also make themselves at home in smaller, slower bodies of water; they dislike algae-choked, stagnant ponds, however. These Pokémon are friendly and agreeable near humans, making them ideal lifeguards for young swimmers. Their floatation sacs can be pierced by sharp objects, however, so their habitats should be kept free of sharp rocks and crags.","Buizel are surprisingly easy to raise even for novice trainers.

Cherrim in their Overcast Forms are similarly sedentary, but they become hyperactive in their Sunshine Forms. They will run around and play happily in the sunlight, a far cry from their gloomy other forms.

Plenty of branches or overhanging rods allow them to travel about with ease. These Pokémon are social and naturally form groups with their own kind in the wild. However, they are very playful and quick to make friends with strangers in new environments. They enjoy solving puzzles, particularly when rewards are involved.","These Pokémon are extraordinarily light, so they can be blown away by even moderate breezes. They should be kept indoors if the weather is even a bit breezy; obviously, fans should not be kept near them, either. The membranes surrounding their bodies are also very delicate, and sharp objects can pierce them and cause these Pokémon to deflate. They can reinflate themselves once their wounds heal, but are unable to fly until they recover.","These Pokémon are extraordinarily light, so they can be blown away by even moderate breezes.

They are nocturnal and are only active once the sun sets. Large cities are not ideal places to raise Misdreavus and Mismagius because of the abundance of street lamps and other light sources. Like their relatives Banette, trained individuals can be taught to feed on positive emotions like happiness instead of negative ones like fear.","In the wild, Murkrow are often flock Pokémon under the leadership of Honchkrow. They seem to enjoy being alone, however, especially when freed from the strict orders of an unforgiving Honchkrow. Both Murkrow and Honchkrow are active in the darkness. Murkrow enjoy hunting for and collecting shiny things, while Honchkrow dislike doing work themselves and will try to command other Pokémon to work for them.","These finicky creatures are enormously difficult to care for; they have specific preferences for temperature, surroundings, and even lighting, becoming irritable when any of these are out of order. Their preferences also change on a whim and without notice; Purugly will not stop eating as long as there is food is in front of them, so trainers should be careful to portion their meals (even if it angers them). Chocolates like Sweet Hearts are poisonous to these Pokémon.","These finicky creatures are enormously difficult to care for; they have specific preferences for temperature, surroundings, and even lighting, becoming irritable when any of these are out of order.

An electric fan will suffice for individuals that are kept indoors. These Pokémon cannot fly without wind, but can be blown away by strong gusts because of their light weight. Because of this, trainers should keep a close eye on their Pokémon when the weather changes. Chimecho like to attach themselves to sturdy branches and overhangs when the wind picks up.","Though many trainers recoil at the thought of raising Stunky because of their infamous odor, they are surprisingly easy to care for. They will only spray if they feel threatened as a last resort, as it takes them a while to recharge their glands; the Pokémon themselves don’t smell terribly unless they have recently sprayed, either. Trainers should be aware that they will have to clean their Pokemon’s scent glands periodically, however, as they can clog and cause them great discomfort.","Though many trainers recoil at the thought of raising Stunky because of their infamous odor, they are surprisingly easy to care for.

They do not eat, for instance, and seem perfectly content floating around doing nothing at all (though some trainers report their Pokémon being receptive to playing with others). It comes as a surprise to many that these metallic Pokémon don’t dislike water, though it makes more sense in light of their connection to rain.","As one may expect of a Pokémon that survived underground dormancy for 2,000 years, these creatures are very hardy and require practically no care at all.

They are both also deathly afraid of water and cannot tolerate even minute amounts of the substance. When Bonsly cry, they are actually expelling excess liquid from their bodies and are not actually (usually) upset. Even high humidity can disturb these Pokémon. Naturally, they should be kept inside at all times during rainy weather. ","These Pokémon love performing, and will mime on street corners for fun even when they do not need food. Mime Jr. love candy and will eat it until they get sick; trainers should know that this is obviously not healthy for them and keep sweets in hard-to-reach locations. Ironically, despite often pretending to be trapped in small boxes, Mr. Mime are claustrophobic and greatly dislike actually being confined.","Though both Chansey and Blissey can be skittish and shy away from people, Happiny can in fact be quite brash. They should always be allowed to hold Oval Stones or similarly-shaped objects, as they will become upset if they cannot find any.  A stone offered by a Happiny should always be accepted, as refusal is taken as a sign of disrespect. Chansey and Blissey can easily take care of themselves (as well as other Pokémon), but it should be noted that immoral acts greatly upset them.","Many people wish to raise Chatot because of their unique talent for mimicking vocalizations; they are especially desired by young, amusable children. While they are not particularly hard to raise, they are not suited for inexperienced novices, either. Chatot must be fed carefully-balanced diets; too much fruit or insects can make them ill, for instance. These Pokémon also enjoy being talked to; one may find they can hold “conversations” by repeating certain phrases in response to others.","Only the most daring, experienced, and noble-hearted trainers should even attempt to raise a Spiritomb. These Pokémon actively ignore reason and sympathy in favor of arbitrary destruction. Simply being near them is enough to cause them to lash out. Spiritualists say that raising a Spiritomb is in essence guiding 108 evil souls to repentance and forgiveness; few have succeeded in achieving this daunting task.","These Pokémon can be difficult to raise, as they tend to be temperamental and a bit disobedient. They prefer warm, dry climates. Gabite in particular love shiny objects; coins and other trinkets are a good way to earn their affection. Gible are clumsy walkers that cannot travel far without stumbling; they like to hide in alcoves and wall indents. Conversely, Garchomp prefer wide open spaces where they can run and fly freely.","These Pokémon can be difficult to raise, as they tend to be temperamental and a bit disobedient.

Snorlax also eat enormous amounts of food, but do so in single sittings while sleeping for as long as a month straight. It takes a lot to wake these slumbering giants, though, so as long as they don’t fall asleep in the middle of a street, they should not cause any problems.","Both of these Pokémon fare well alongside humans. Since they can not only understand human speech, but also interpret inner thoughts and emotions as well, they can quickly form deep bonds with their trainers. Like most Fighting-types, they spend a lot of their time training in solitude; they dislike being disturbed during this time, but can be very affectionate Pokémon when not busy in practice. ","Both of these Pokémon fare well alongside humans.

They are actually laid-back, easygoing creatures that don’t require much more than food and shelter. Since their toxicity is connected to their diets, trainers should raise their Pokémon on nonpoisonous sustenance rather than their usual prey. It should still be noted that both Pokémon still produce their own natural poison, however, and only strengthen it with ingested toxins (mixed in their sacs).","These Pokémon require very damp habitats in order to survive.

They are used to boggy conditions, however, and as such cannot tolerate aridity. Their prefer areas with acidic soil and high humidity. They naturally spend most of their time up in the treetops, so trainers should provide them with structures to hang off of using their vines. While they can tolerate poor lighting, Carnivine still fare best with plenty of bright sunshine.","Though these Pokémon are naturally deep-sea dwellers, they are actually tolerant of a wide range of pressures and salinities (some Finneon can even survive entirely in fresh water). Finneon function on a standard day-night cycle with regular, consistent periods of sunlight each day. Constant artificial lighting or irregular periods of darkness can cause them stress. Lumineon prefer to rest on sandy substrate at the very bottoms of their enclosures.","Though these Pokémon are naturally deep-sea dwellers, they are actually tolerant of a wide range of pressures and salinities (some Finneon can even survive entirely in fresh water).

Mantyke are considerably easier, but can be quite a handful because of how playful they are. Although they can be raised without Remoraid, trainers should never separate a Remoraid and a Mantyke or Mantine that have already bonded; doing so would induce great distress in both Pokémon.","Both of these Pokémon dwell in snow-covered areas; if kept somewhere warmer, they will quickly remedy the situation by summoning snowstorms to blanket their surroundings in snow. Abomasnow very much dislike crowds and noise; they can become angry in bustling environments, lashing out with powerful blizzards. Snover, on the other hand, actually often are excited by large groups of people and Pokémon.","Both of these Pokémon dwell in snow-covered areas; if kept somewhere warmer, they will quickly remedy the situation by summoning snowstorms to blanket their surroundings in snow.

As such, they are social creatures, despite their ruthlessness in hunting. They will become agitated when isolated for long periods of time, so trainers should let them spend plenty of time with other Pokémon. Because of their sharp claws, however, it is advised to keep them alongside hardier species. Sneasel in particular will form close bonds with a single partner.","The Magnemite family doesn’t eat food, drink water, or even breathe air, so they are easy for most people to raise. Generators can easily be bought from most hardware stores, producing a steady supply of electricity for these Pokémon to feed on; even if trainers forget to feed them, they can produce their own energy by spinning their magnets. They may rust when left in the rain for too long. Additionally, strong magnets of either polarity can affect their locomotion.","Since these Pokémon rely on their tongues to learn about their surroundings, it is important that trainers insure that they keep up with good oral hygiene. Though their saliva is naturally antibacterial, infections can result from minor cuts and abrasions on their sensitive tongues; mouthwash is an easy way to combat these afflictions. Very tart, salty, and particularly spicy foods can also overwhelm their taste buds and render them unable to taste anything for a while afterwards.","These Pokémon are notoriously hardy, but are very weak to water. Their thick armor prevents them from reacting to its presence quickly, so trainers should keep a close eye on their Pokémon  in wet environments. Rhyhorn cannot turn while charging, so they need plenty of open space while running. Rhyhorn racing tracks have sharp, 90° turns for this reason. Rhyperior need access to exposed stone to provide themselves with ammo for their rock-based attacks.","As with most plant-like Pokémon, both Tangela and Tangrowth need ample water and sunlight to thrive. These Pokémon seem to require much less of either resource than other Grass-types, however. This likely is a result of their carnivorous diets as well as their tendency to stay still for extended periods of time; it is normal for these Pokémon, particularly Tangrowth, to sit patiently in hiding for hours or even days while waiting for prey to pass by.","As baby Pokémon, Elekid can be a handful at times. They often have short bursts of energy, during which they will spin their arms wildly to charge up. Doing so quickly tires them out, however, and they have to rest immediately afterwards. Electabuzz and Electivire are comparatively low-maintenance. As long as they are provided with a steady source of electricity (usually from a generator), they are largely able to take care of themselves.","Although these Pokémon are able to acclimate to moderate climates with few problems, they should not be brought out in cold weather, which can turn them sluggish and lethargic. They enjoy taking baths in hot lava, so trainers should let them explore near active volcanoes (from a far, safe distance of course) if possible. Magby will expel dull red flames or sooty smoke when they are sick or ill.","Togepi imprint on the first living thing they see, and for this reason can only be raised by trainers that have hatched them from eggs. They are very needy as baby Pokémon, and have to be fed and soothed often; their shells are also fragile and can crack from rough handling. All members of this line greatly dislike anger and hostility. Being trapped around these emotions greatly distresses them. Togekiss are clumsy on the ground and require plenty of open air to fly around freely.","Yanma and Yanmega are great fliers, but do need to rest on perches every once in a while to recuperate the large amounts of energy they spend beating their wings so quickly. Since these Yanmega are not at all fickle when it comes to food, they will be satisfied with fresh meat as opposed to live prey. They particularly enjoy being tossed their meals so that they can catch them in the air with their powerful jaws.","The Eeveelutions are adapted to life alongside humans. Each has their own preferential habitat and climate, which should be made relatively obvious by their typings. It should be noted that each evolution tends to become stressed when removed from their preferred environment, so trainers should take into account where they live before choosing which Pokémon to evolve their Eevee into.","The Eeveelutions are adapted to life alongside humans.

They tend to be more active during the night, but can remain active during the day; Gliscor, on the other hand, are strictly nocturnal and like to hide in dark places until the sun sets. They need lots of open space to fly and should be let outside during the night. Trainers should contact their local Pokémon League branch to discuss their Pokémon’s feeding routines.","Because of their thick coats, these Pokémon fare very poorly in warm environments. Individuals kept even in temperate climates should have their coats trimmed to prevent overheating. Mamoswine tusks are made of ice and will melt when exposed to moderate heat. They are difficult Pokémon to raise outside of arctic environments, but can be trained to chill the air around them to keep their tusks from melting, though doing so for a while will tire them out.","Being the first instance of a virtual Pokémon, Porygon are rather clunky and unwieldy. They do not do much and can be slow at responding to commands. Porygon2 are more streamlined, and for the most part are self-sustaining. Porygon-Z can be a danger to themselves when glitching out, so trainers should be prepared to recall them into their Poké Balls if they do so. All members of the line should be returned periodically to their Poké Balls so that they can recharge.","Ralts is perhaps one of the hardest Pokémon for the average person to raise; they are extremely timid, teleporting away from the slightest sign of anger. This usually exasperates their trainers, causing them to flee even more, and so on. Not everyone can raise these Pokémon, as they require the utmost patience and optimism to properly develop. Both Gallade and Gardevoir, however, are extremely loyal and powerful Pokémon any trainer would be lucky to have.","These Pokémon don’t require much attention; they barely move or react to anything. Nosepass are content as long as they are around enough iron to eat. Probopass seem a bit more responsive to care. They may play games of “tag” with small children using their Mini-Noses. Sometimes, unwanted metal objects may get stuck in their mustaches, and trainers may have to use quite a bit of force to pull them out. Electronics tend to malfunction around these creatures.","Duskull and Dusclops can siphon life force from any living fauna; trainers should contact their local branch of the Pokémon League to arrange an ethical feeding routine for their Pokémon. These Pokémon also cannot bear light. Dusknoir will often wander away from their trainers for long periods of time, seeming as if they have separate goals to fulfill. This should not worry their trainers; these Pokémon will always return once their tasks are completed.","All members of this family thrive in subzero temperatures. They can survive for some time in warmer climates; Snorunt in particular can dwell even in direct sunlight as long as there is still unmelted snow (or ice, which may be more convenient for trainers) on the ground. Froslass and Glalie are more resilient to heat, but should be covered in ice periodically in order to keep their body temperatures low.","Rotom can be quite a handful to raise, though they are rarely ever intentionally malicious. Their trainers will find that they can and will possess practically any electrical device; Rotom often jump around from appliance to appliance to surprise unwary people and Pokémon. They are playful creatures that will play pranks for attention of left alone for too long. Trainers should also be aware that their electricity bills will likely be higher as a result of how these Pokémon feed.","","","","","","","","","","Phione require very clean, warm water; they are almost entirely composed of the substance, so even small changes in water quality can have drastic effects on their health. They are poor swimmers that require currents in order to navigate. Phione migrate annually to a hidden location somewhere in the sea south of Sinnoh; trainers should let their Phione complete this journey alone, as it is illegal to follow these Pokémon without a permit from the Pokémon League.","","","","","","Snivy are infamous for being haughty and fickle, making them a challenge for beginning trainers. These Pokémon aren’t so much defiant as much as dismissive; they only refuse orders that they believe to be a waste of their time rather than disobey commands in general. It is difficult to trick these intelligent Pokémon into agreement; dedicated trainers will learn, though, that with enough effort and affection, they will be learn to trust their trainers’ judgements.","Snivy are infamous for being haughty and fickle, making them a challenge for beginning trainers.

Once comfortable, they are easily excitable. Pignite and Emboar are much more outgoing. These Pokémon eat almost constantly, so their trainers should keep their food supplies well-stocked. Pignite and Emboar also enjoy wrestling with other Pokémon to practice their abilities; they are skilled at controlling their strength so as to not harm smaller sparring partners. ","Tepig are somewhat shy at first, but quickly grow accustomed to foreign surroundings.

They take great care of their shell-like implements, sharpening them on stones and cleaning them in water. Dewott in particular follow strict training schedules and can become upset when unable to adhere to them. Oshawott will try to look tough in the face of danger, but quickly lose this facade when actually threatened.","These Pokémon are naturally semiaquatic, but fare surprisingly well with only moderate access to water.

They cannot stand being alone, becoming incredibly anxious when they feel they are not being watched over by a friend. They are also burrowers that are most comfortable sleeping underground. Trainers may find soft night-lights to be soothing for their Pokémon; the gentle light resembles that of a patrolling Watchog, helping these Pokémon stay at ease.","Patrat and Watchog are both communal creatures.

In fact, human interaction is necessary to keep them happy. Though naturally adapted to alpine climates, they can easily dwell in warmer areas as long as their fur is trimmed so they don’t overheat. Herdier fur is a bit trickier than that of either of its evolutions; it should be brushed daily and shampooed weekly.","These Pokémon are considered “man’s best friends” for a good reason; they have adapted to life with humans over hundreds of years, making them very loyal companions.

They are intelligent enough to know that they shouldn’t “bite the hand that feeds them,” so to speak. With that being said, they should not be kept around smaller Pokémon that they can easily take advantage of, as they may bully them to pass the time. Liepard are less actively mischievous; prefer to spend their free time simply sleeping.","Purrloin aren’t particularly “warm” creatures, but they are surprisingly docile if well-cared for.

They spend the day resting in quiet areas while cloaked in Dream Mist. At night, they will simply wander about to feed on the dreams of others; naturally, these Pokémon should not be kept in isolation, where they would be unable to find slumbering people and Pokémon. Munna and Musharna that spew thick, heavy smoke have likely consumed a nightmare and should be taken to a Pokémon Center to be treated.","These Pokémon are easy to care for.

Carracosta are truly semiaquatic, however, spending extended periods of time on the shore. Trainers should adjust their habitats accordingly to accommodate for this. These Pokémon may begin eating metal appliances and structures if they aren’t fed enough iron.","Archen are poor fliers, but they like to hop between branches in trees; trainers should provide them with plenty of ledges to jump off of and around on. Archeops require plenty of space in order to take off into the air, so they do not fare well in cramped spaces. Though they naturally form groups with others of their kind, these Pokémon actually seem to fare well in solitude. They are easily spooked by sudden, loud noises or other surprises.","Archen are poor fliers, but they like to hop between branches in trees; trainers should provide them with plenty of ledges to jump off of and around on.

They try to stay off of the ground except when foraging, so trainers should provide them with plenty of ledges to glide between. These Pokémon cannot fly well when winds are too weak or strong; it may take some experimenting to figure out what conditions are optimal for them. Emolga have an instinct to hoard food before winter even when in captivity, so trainers should keep an eye out for hidden stashes.","Karrablast like to hide in tall grasses; however, they are very active around those that they are comfortable with and love to play. They should not be kept around Shelmet, however, as they constantly try to pry the unfortunate Pokémon form their shells. Escavalier are more reserved creatures.

They require very large bodies of water relative to their sizes because of how they swim and rest. Alomomola find joy in caring for injured creatures; they will be saddened if their trainers elect to take their other Pokémon to Pokémon Centers instead of placing them under their care. Still, trainers should not let their dejection influence decisions regarding the health of their Pokémon.","Trainers may find it difficult to keep track of tiny Joltik. Luckily, once they find a suitable source of electricity, they rarely move away from it. Trainers can purchase special, rug-like electrical pads for their Joltik to use in feeding, though some may find it easier to simply wear wool clothing and let their Joltik attach to them as they go about their day.

They are an obedient species that will heed orders dutifully. These Pokémon have an instinctual aversion to fire, as it is the main weapon of its natural predator Heatmor. Even the sound of a crackling flame will send Durant into a panicked frenzy. These Pokémon love to dig burrows underground, even if they have no queen to serve and protect.","These Pokémon should only be raised by experienced trainers.

Trainers will quickly find that they must groom their Pokémon’s fur periodically, even if they do not plan on styling it. Furfrou fur grows very quickly and can become unmanageable if left untrimmed. Trainers that do style their Furfrou should groom their Pokémon frequently to maintain their appearances.","Espurr are very difficult Pokémon to raise. They are eternally mortified of their own power, and being around others only adds to their anxiety. Their trainers must walk a fine line between comforting their Espurr and giving them the space that they need. As such, they should only be raised by experienced trainers.

Unlike most other Ice-types, however, they are able to create such environments on their own without much expended energy, as their crystals naturally emanate subzero air to chill surrounding moisture. These Pokémon are also active from the evening to sunrise, when temperatures are the coldest; in temperate climates, they will seek shelter during the day from the warm sun.","These Pokémon are most comfortable at freezing or near-freezing temperatures.

Each has their own preferential habitat and climate, which should be made relatively obvious by their typings. It should be noted that each evolution tends to become stressed when removed from their preferred environment, so trainers should take into account where they live before choosing which Pokémon to evolve their Eevee into.","Hawlucha need high places to leap from in order to fly; they also require drafts of wind, though even slight breezes are enough for them to soar. These Pokémon spend much of their time devising new fighting techniques and would benefit from practice dummies to test out their innovations. They also take very meticulous care of their feathers, which they preen frequently to keep clean and vibrant. ","Although they are sometimes seen as pests because of the nuisances they can be to electrical and radio devices, they are also common pets because of their ease of care. Dedenne can feed themselves through power outlets and can be trained to restrict their radio waves so they do not interfere with household appliances. Their delicate antennae are crucial for how these Pokémon attack and communicate, so trainers should keep a close eye on them in case they get damaged.","Caring for these Pokémon is extraordinarily simple; to elaborate, they require virtually no care at all. Carbink are extraordinarily hardy and can tolerate a huge range of climates and temperatures. Rain can slowly wear down their bodies, but even this process can take centuries; Carbink also know to seek shelter when the weather becomes wet, so this is rarely a problem. When all else fails, they can enter states of dormancy to wait out potential dangers.","Goomy are weak Pokémon that like to hide themselves from danger, squeezing their soft bodies into crevices and tree hollows. Sliggoo similarly prefer dark conditions away from bright sunlight. Goodra are much more comfortable in the open than their pre-evolutions; however, all three evolutions of this family must stay moist at all times to keep their mucus hydrated.

However, if a Klefki sees a key and its trainer denies it access to it, it will become very upset. Trainers should note that Klefki will only release keys to trusted individuals; angering their Pokémon can result in being locked out of one’s home or other doorways. Klefki hate rain, not because it can rust them but because it can rust some of the metal keys they hold.","These Pokémon prefer the quiet and solitude of dense woods. Phantump are comforted by the presence of trees; they will get scared and even begin to cry when taken to loud, bustling metropolises. Both evolutions are adapted to shady conditions and dislike sunlight. Trevenant communicate with one another and control trees through their roots; they may try to dig through tile or concrete when in buildings to reach soil.","These Pokémon prefer the quiet and solitude of dense woods.

They will be very persistent in ensuring their friends do not “beach” themselves again.","Fomantis require large amounts of sunlight to grow properly. They dislike remaining in one place for long, even in the safety of civilization. Lurantis can be a bit tedious to raise because of how much they care about their appearances. Though some trainers go to great lengths to raise particularly beautiful Lurantis, however, most trainers will find that ample food, water, and sunlight is enough to keep them happy and healthy.","Fomantis require large amounts of sunlight to grow properly.

Morelull also relocate to new patches of soil every night, so trainers should provide them with enough space to do so. Shiinotic spend their nights releasing glowing spores into the air; there seems to be a particular method in which they do so, leading some to believe they are trying to communicate with other Shiinotic.","These Pokémon require consistent daylight cycles in order to function properly; Morelull in particular regulate their feeding and sleep cycles by the light of the sun.

On the other hand, Salazzle can easily win over male Pokémon of any species. Trainers should teach their Salazzle to only emit their pheromones in battle to limit this, though it should be noted that they have a harder time controlling production during mating season.","Male Salandit are subservient, cowardly creatures that can easily be taken advantage of by more commanding Pokémon; consequently, they should not be raised alongside more domineering species.

A League permit is required to raise Bewear, as trainers must prove that they have trained their Pokémon to use nonlethal force; to date, no consistent methods have been found, so this task will vary for each trainer. Stufful loathe being touched unless they are very comfortable around the other being; trainers must prevent others from petting their Stufful so both parties remain unharmed.","Only the most experienced trainers should attempt to raise either of these creatures.

Steenee can be a handful because of their obliviousness, but they are well-intentioned; trainers should just be sure to keep breakable objects away from them. Tsareena will only obey trainers they believe are worthy of their respect. Making intelligent calls during tough battles will go a long way towards earning a Tsareena’s loyalty.","Bounsweet are very easy to raise, as they do not need to eat and prefer to stay away from other Pokémon that may view them as food.

Fresh flowers are all they need to be happy. Trainers should be wary of store-bought flowers, however, which may have been treated with preservatives that can their Comfey ill when they attach them to their vines. Comfey also help keep other Pokémon happy and healthy. These Pokémon do not far well in barren, arid environments, as excess dryness and heat can cause their flowers to wilt. Comfey will become very anxious when barren of blooms entirely.","Only veteran trainers should attempt to raise Oranguru. This is not because they are dangerous or difficult to care for; they are actually peaceful and can entirely care for themselves. Oranguru are very intelligent Pokémon, however, that will feel insulted and may refuse orders when commanded by trainers they believe are not as capable as themselves. They will only partner with those that have proven to be their equals or superiors in wits and strategy.","Trainers who choose to raise Passimian must be prepared to work just as hard as their Pokémon in training. They must first assert themselves as “bosses” in order to earn their Pokémon’s respect. Trainers must also lead routine, rigorous training exercises for their Passimian that they must also take part in themselves. Passimian keep a close eye on their trainers’ actions; poor form when throwing Poké Balls, for instance, can easily damage one’s reputation in their eyes.","Trainers with lots of Pokémon may have difficulty raising Wimpod, as these skittish creatures will flee at the slightest disturbance. They can easily be taken advantage of by larger, more standoffish Pokémon. Few creatures dare bother fearsome-looking Golisopod, but those that do will find that they are almost as easily bullied as Wimpod. Trainers should keep a close eye on their Golisopod to make sure that this does not occur.","Trainers with lots of Pokémon may have difficulty raising Wimpod, as these skittish creatures will flee at the slightest disturbance.

Sandygast require sand to grow larger and eventually evolve, and both evolutions gradually lose sand from natural forces like wind. They also should not be raised in excessively wet environments; while some water helps their sand hold together, too much can easily break it down.","If one plans to raise these Pokémon outside of sandy areas, they must make sure to always keep a steady supply of sand on hand.

These Pokémon should remain moist at all times, though their mucus helps them stay hydrated for up to a week. Since they dislike moving, trainers should make sure to keep a steady food source very close to them. It can be a huge hassle when Pyukumuku decide to root themselves in precarious places, such as on top of furniture. A heating pad placed over such spots will encourage them to relocate on their own.","Firsthand reports from Aether Foundation volunteers remark that Type: Null are temperamental and difficult to care for. Aether President Gladion admitted that his Silvally is sometimes still temperamental, though the episodes quickly subside. He recalled staying awake for hours at night alongside his Type: Null as it crouched over in pain, unable to sleep.","Firsthand reports from Aether Foundation volunteers remark that Type: Null are temperamental and difficult to care for.

Minior will gradually get heavier as they grow older. Those raised by trainers rarely have to worry about pulverized shells, as falls from only a few feet up are not enough to shatter them. Attacks in battle may fragment their armor, but this usually only results in a few pieces that can easily be reassembled. Minior can repair small cracks on their own. Trainers should quickly recall Minior Cores to minimize exposure.","Trainers should not be afraid of waking their Komala; they can sleep through quite literally anything. With that said, constant loud noises (such as in cities) can make them restless, so their surroundings should be kept quite for at least some portion of the day; for most trainers, this is usually when they go to bed for the night. Komala cannot sleep well without something to cling onto; though they are most comfortable with their logs, they may also grasp onto their trainers’ arms.","Trainers should be cautious when handling both Turtonator and their food; accidental pressure can easily lead to explosions. Obviously, these Pokémon should be kept away from open flames. It is the responsibility of their trainers to properly dispose of their explosive waste; they should be kept in a large container of water until they can be deactivated with the appropriate chemicals (Poké Marts near Turtonator habitats usually carry such products).","Togedemaru take great care of their fur, as it has difficulty bristling and gathering electricity when it is matted. Their fur is water-resistant (as they usually stand in the open during storms in hopes of being struck by lightning), but dirt can weigh it down. Togedemaru will get restless if kept indoors during thunderstorms; they should be taken some distance away from houses if outside, however, as their lightning rods attract many strikes.","All Mimikyu desire in life is affection; they will gladly overlook a trainer’s shortcomings as long as they are loved. Mimikyu react adversely to light; though their costumes help protect them, they still prefer to remain in shady areas. They are very protective of their disguises and stay far away from rain, fire, and other potential damaging sources. Mimikyu repair their costumes when they are broken and need cloth, sticks, and pigments (Berry Juice usually suffices) to do so.","Bruxish are at home in warm waters. They like to bury themselves on the floors of their habitats; though they can make do with rocky substrate, they are best adapted to fine sand. Bruxish grind their teeth often (and indeed have to do so because of their fast growth rate), and the sound can induce headaches in those nearby. For this reason, they should not be raised alongside most other aquatic Pokémon and their tanks should be made soundproof.","Drampa fare best when around young children. If one does not have children of his or her own, most local school and daycares would happily accept the aid of trained Drampa. Though naturally found in high altitudes, these Pokémon seem to be able to survive just as well at sea level. Drampa prefer harvesting their own Berries so that they can select and sort them to fit their needs; trainers raising Drampa should also be prepared to plant Berry trees as well. ","Dhelmise can be difficult to read, as they do not seem to express emotions in any way that humans can easily discern. They can be difficult to raise in captivity; not only are they large, but they also have heavy anchors that can easily shatter most glass tanks. Those that do manage to create suitable enclosures for Dhelmise report that they seem very distant; if they have enough floating kelp in their tanks, they will simply mind their own businesses and go about their days. ","Jangmo-o are social creatures that have a tough time training on their own. Though they may try to appear content in solitude, they actually are far more at ease when with company. Hakamo-o, on the other hand, frequently venture out alone to find sparring partners. They like battling new opponents and get bored when fighting the same foes over and over. Kommo-o are mostly self-sufficient; they get upset when kept from fighting foes they believe are worthy of battle, however.","Jangmo-o are social creatures that have a tough time training on their own.

These Pokémon love to make music, so they can be quite loud at times. Urban trainers should look into soundproofing material if noise is an issue, while traveling trainers may find secluded clearings to be an excellent place to practice.","As photosynthesizing Grass-types, these Pokémon require plenty of sunlight.

Cold weather can render Scorbunny sluggish and weakened due to their viscous heat sacs, though this is less of a problem for Raboot and Cinderace thanks to their thicker fur.

They like to be near water because they can camouflage themselves into it; the mere presence of the liquid nearby helps them stay calm. Drizzile are at another extreme, being quite lazy and antisocial. It can be a real challenge to get them to train, doubly so if other Pokémon are involved.

This also goes for trainers picking from wild Berry trees; one should keep an eye out for rustling in the canopy before approaching a Berry tree. Skwovet and Greedent are also attracted to Berries trainers and Pokémon are carrying around, and may chew through the backpacks of camping travelers to get at them. Their senses of smell are not particularly great, so they rely mostly on sight to identify Berry stashes. Keeping Berries hidden while near the habitats of these Pokémon is a wise idea.","Skwovet are infamous for dropping out of Berry trees on unsuspecting farmers simply trying to harvest them.

Gossifleur pollen and Eldegoss cotton both can trigger allergic reactions in those who are susceptible. When they swarm, these reactions can be quite intense; even people and Pokémon who normally experience no effects may end up with runny noses and teary eyes during their peak season.

These Pokémon can be easily heard well before they are seen, so trainers should keep their ears open whenever they are in farm country. Dubwool may charge at enemies if threatened, but they cannot actually gore anyone with their horns. Still, their bouncy fur will likely knock unfortunate targets right on their bottoms with surprising force. ","Rolling Wooloo are a perennial problem for rural travelers, as they can tumble down hills in huge herds without watching where they are going.

It takes a skilled trainer to properly handle these Pokémon without resulting in injury for themselves or others. Indeed, many Drednaw situations in tourist spots result from trainers releasing their Drednaw after finding themselves unable to care for them properly.","These Pokémon are not recommended for beginning or even intermediate trainers.

They love to play with both their trainers and with other Pokémon. In particular, they enjoy playing fetch with round objects. Trainers should note that Yamper will instinctively chase fast-moving objects. They also have little impulse control when it comes to treats and will overeat if treats are given too liberally.

Still, these Pokémon detest crowded places with many emotions in the air, and thus should only be raised in more rural environments.","Impidimp, while harmless, can be a pain at first to raise due to their tendencies to steal tiny things from their owners. They will often learn over time, however, that most people experience enough inconveniences in a day to satiate them without them needing to do anything. Morgrem and Grimmsnarl can be quite difficult to raise if not caught as Impidimp; trainers will need to be strict in enforcing rules for their Morgrem and Grimmsnarl to keep them from causing trouble for others.","Impidimp, while harmless, can be a pain at first to raise due to their tendencies to steal tiny things from their owners.

They are easy to care for and can easily adapt to life with humans. They can seem scatter-brained at first because of how easily distracted they are by their surroundings, but trainers quickly learn that they are just very curious, and usually let them fully explore what is around them. Linoone have great difficulty turning, so trainers should not walk with them on curved roads; they will likely crash very often.","The Meowth line is adapted to urban environments, so trainers in big cities will have an easy time training them. They are generally solitary, sometimes even preferring to stalk streets alone at night without their trainers. Meowth enjoy round and shiny objects. Trainers should never grab or damage a Persian’s whiskers, because the hairs are vital to the Pokémon’s ability to navigate about.","The average trainer would have a difficult time raising a Corsola. These Pokémon are very social, as one would guess from their colony-forming habits. They also fickle regarding water temperature, salinity, purity, and even sunlight--although they aren’t plants, Corsola become frail and weak when deprived of natural sunlight. Most notably, their horns will fade to a pale white if left in darkness before being treated.","Farfetch’d spend a good portion of their time in the water, so trainers should seek out small ponds, oftentimes in local parks, where their Pokémon can swim. Their leeks are of utmost importance to them, and should never leave their side. Farfetch’d will become very stressed if their leeks are taken away from them, even if they trainers simply want to clean mud off of them or something similar. Leek maintenance is best left for the Farfetch’d to handle. ","These Pokémon love performing, and will mime on street corners for fun even when they do not need food. Mime Jr. love candy and will eat it until they get sick; trainers should know that this is obviously not healthy for them and keep sweets in hard-to-reach locations. Ironically, despite often pretending to be trapped in small boxes, Mr. Mime are claustrophobic and greatly dislike actually being confined.","Yamask seem to be lonely Pokémon that are unaccustomed to attention; they may be hesitant around strangers at first, but will eventually warm up to them. Trainers should clean and shine their masks periodically, but they should never take them out of their Yamask’s sight; doing so will cause them great anxiety. Cofagrigus also should be shined periodically. They spend most of their time remaining totally still. Feeding them can be very costly, however.","These Pokémon will be perfectly content if left alone in a well-stocked pastry kitchen. Milcery love to be spun around, as it helps them agitate their cream. Both evolutions enjoy being in the kitchen when people and Pokémon are cooking, even when they are making savory dishes. They should be kept away from direct heat, however. Alcremie derive great pleasure from people, especially their trainers, enjoy pastries made with their cream. They can become talented chefs in their own right with enough practice. Bakers and pastry chefs will find these Pokémon a natural fit.","These Pokémon will be perfectly content if left alone in a well-stocked pastry kitchen.

A Falinks missing an individual will be unable to create formations properly, severely hindering all aspects of their lives. The brass is the most important unit of a Falinks; should the brasses go missing, the other units will be in disarray. Falinks spend much of their time practicing their formations, and trainers should make sure give them time to do so daily.","","Snom and Frosmoth require freezing temperatures in order to thrive. A Snom's spikes will begin to shrink in warm climates. Snom also feel safer hidden within snow piles or dangling from the branches of trees. Frosmoth naturally migrate to follow snowy weather, but as long as their environments are suitable, trained Frosmoth do not need to do this (indeed, Snom born in arctic climates may not migrate their entire lives).","Snom and Frosmoth require freezing temperatures in order to thrive.

Unlike some other Rock-types, they are not bothered much by rain, as their stony bodies are not easily eroded. Even cloudy weather that obscures the sun does not hinder their sun-gazing, as they can precisely detect where the sun should be through an overcast sky.","Eiscue should be kept cold at all times. Though they can tolerate warmer temperatures for short amounts of time thanks to their chilling ice blocks, their heads are very heat-sensitive, and their ice blocks will melt quickly in hot climates. Even in cold places, Eiscue despise being ice-less and will want to dip their heads in water immediately should their ice ever shatter. Seawater or a substitute is the best choice for this, as it remains liquid below the freezing point of pure water; this allows Eiscue to dip their heads in it with ease.","Indeedee are easy Pokémon for trainers to raise thanks to their co-dependence with humans in many areas. Unless a trainer is abnormally narcissistic, Indeedee can easily feed on enough gratitude and other positive emotions throughout the course of day. Though they find anger and hostility distasteful, they are not particularly bothered by them (indeed, one would think that is a necessity for Pokémon working in the service industry). Trainers should not touch their sensitive horns without permission.","Morpeko are more or less always hungry; overfeeding is not much of an issue with these Pokémon, as their high metabolisms will burn through energy almost as fast as they can eat. Hangry Mode Morpeko are not pleasant for anyone to be around, their trainers included. Trainers must stay attentive of their Morpeko's eating habits and ensure that they always have snacks at the ready when traveling, just in case. Only responsible trainers that can quickly detect and react to the first signs of a Morpeko's hunger should attempt raising them.","These Pokémon are fairly easy-going and tolerant of a wide range of conditions. They require plenty of water and copper ore to thrive, but otherwise are a hardy species. Both evolutions are social and should not be raised in solitude, however; they can make friends with other species of Pokémon, so it is not necessary for trainers to raise an entire pack of Cufant or Copperajah for the sake of an individual.","These Pokémon are fairly easy-going and tolerant of a wide range of conditions.

Each of them experience their own unique obstacles towards survival, and there are few resources capable of treating them should anything go wrong (which may be quite frequently). All require unique feeding methods. Arctozolt need sophisticated external temperature regulation; Dracovish need to exercise on underwater treadmills to keep up their leg strength. Arctovish need assistance breathing when in stressful conditions.","Only the most experienced, well-equipped trainers should even attempt to raise any of these Pokémon.

Rain is the most obvious source of danger, but Water-types, puddles, and even water fountains in urban environments can pose a risk to these Pokémon. Duraludon can remove rust on their own and regrow damaged areas over time, but they find the process quite troublesome and prefer to avoid it unless absolutely necessary.","Dreepy need a strong support system in order to thrive. They cannot fend for themselves and rely on stronger Pokémon (not necessarily their evolutions) to take care of them. Drakloak feel compelled to care for a younger of smaller Pokémon, as do Dragapult to a lesser extent. They will become restless if left with an empty nest for extended periods of time. Overall, these Pokémon should be raised alongside other Pokémon that can develop lasting interspecies relationships in order to take advantage of their abilities.","Dreepy need a strong support system in order to thrive.

Pidgey are skittish, however, and will whip up small gusts that can knock people over when startled. Pidgeotto and Pidgeot can create more powerful windstorms and also attack with their beaks and talons, but attacks against humans are exceedingly rare and almost always the result of prior harrasment or abuse.","Pidgey and their evolutions pose little threat to trainers who respect their space.

They will bite those that startle them as a reflex, sometimes even biting their trainers. Raticate are especially touchy about their whiskers, snapping if they are even brushed. Their bites may become infected, leading to further complications.

When angered, both Mankey and Primeape are unable to think clearly, so they may accidentally attack their allies. Trainers should take caution of the warning signs they signal before attacking: flared nostrils, heavy breathing, and tense shuddering all indicate that these Pokémon are about to lose their tempers.","Of course, the primary danger regarding these Pokémon is their fits of rage.

With that said, however, both Pokémon are fiercely protective of their trainers, and may attack those that they believe are endangering them by biting or by using Fire-type attacks. It is the responsibility of Growlithe and Arcanine trainers to ensure their Pokémon that approaching strangers mean no harm and to keep them from lashing out.","Neither Growlithe nor Arcanine pose significant threat to people, since they are so accustomed to being around them.

They are often employed by companies that require heavy lifting, often seen working as movers or personal trainers. Intentional attacks by any member of this family are exceedingly rare; however, accidents sometimes occur when the Pokémon forget their own strength, but overall, they are very safe and easy to raise, perfect for new trainers.","Machop and their evolutions are well-adapted to life with humans.

Weepinbell also can expel the same acid, but in larger volumes; wild Weepinbell may latch onto the hands of travelers and attempt to digest the limbs. Victreebel are extremely dangerous in the wild, as they are known to chase down and attempt to swallow humans. All members of the line are afraid of fire and will stay away from open flames. Carrying torches is advised when traveling in deep jungles.","Bellsprout can spit out a mildly corrosive acid that can leave burns on the skin.

Their poison is not fatal to humans, however, and normally only cause pain, redness, and swelling. Given how common both Tentacool and Tentacruel are, this caveat is a blessing to trainers everywhere. Tentacruel are known to constrict victims with their tentacles and attempt to drag them to the bottom of the sea, though they normally don’t go after prey as large as people.","The tentacles of these Pokémon are poisonous, even when the Pokémon themselves are unconscious.

Parts of Geodude and Graveler may chip off while they are rolling (Golem have smoother bodies that don’t chip as easily), sending debris flying. Finally, all members of the line are capable of using Explosion, with their blast radii increasing with each subsequent evolution.","These Pokémon certainly aren’t light, so being hit by a rolling Graveler or Golem would not be a painless experience.

If cornered, they will instinctively rear their legs and kick backwards with their fiery legs. Rapidash are more confrontational, instead choosing to charge at foes with their flames and hooves. They will not attack unless threatened, however.

Though they possess psychic abilities of varying strength, they rarely exert the energy to utilize them except when in battle. Slowking are very friendly with humans, acting as mentors or gurus in some cases. It should be noted that the Shellder attached to these Pokémon can become defensive when their hosts (and food supplies) and endangered, however. ","Since no Pokémon in this family are very active, they pose virtually no danger to humans.

They are known to siphon electrical energy from power lines and generators. Additionally, the magnetic fields they generate can cause devices to malfunction. The radio waves Magneton emit can dry the air and cause earaches in some people. ","Other than the standard warnings of electrocution that come with most Electric-type Pokémon, the primary source of concern regarding these Pokémon stems not from their danger to humans, but rather to electronic devices.

Still, they are very skilled at defending themselves with their leeks, and seem uncannily perceptive when seeking out the weak spots of opponents. Though normally noble and honorable opponents, Farfetch’d will not hesitate to strike with “cheap shots” if their leeks are in danger.","Doduo are best described as “eccentric”--they act strangely and unpredictably at times as their two heads collaborate alone; people should give them a wide berth in the wild. Dodrio can be aggressive, and are very fast, known to chase travelers and even cars. Both Pokémon are very raucous. Doduo never are fully asleep since one head is awake, and as such, they always make noise. Dodrio will let out a loud call at the same time every day--usually very early in the morning.","Doduo are best described as “eccentric”--they act strangely and unpredictably at times as their two heads collaborate alone; people should give them a wide berth in the wild.

The most dangerous things about them are likely their horns. However, they rarely use them to attack, as their primary purpose is to poke breathing holes into ice floes. Though these Pokémon enjoy swimming with friends and may invite their trainers to swim with them, it is not advised for people to get into the freezing water with them without proper equipment.","Seel and Dewgong are both playful Pokémon that almost never harm humans.

The trails they leave behind will be inhospitable to life for long periods of time, though trained Pokémon can more easily control their expulsion of toxins.

These Pokémon are commonly encountered in subterranean environments, where their large statures can sometimes unintentionally make them hazards, especially in tight tunnels. Their tunneling is also known to cause earthquakes and weaken foundations when too many intersecting tunnels are burrowed underneath structures.","Drowzee are basically harmless to both people and other Pokémon, since they feed exclusively on dreams. They may put threats to sleep before fleeing, however. Hypno are more problematic, as they are known to hypnotize young children into following them into forests for them to feed on dreams for extended periods of time. Though the children are left unharmed, the Hypno also generally don’t bother returning the children back home after they awaken.","Drowzee are basically harmless to both people and other Pokémon, since they feed exclusively on dreams.

Kingler can crush bones in their larger claws, and can simply swing them around to slam into threats with powerful force. Their smaller claws are weaker, but can still inflict respectable damage. Krabby will instinctively attempt to dig beneath themselves when frightened.

However, it should be noted that attacking one Exeggutor in a herd will anger the entire herd and cause them to stampede.

Lickitung saliva can cause numbing that will wear off in a few minutes, but Lickilicky saliva can cause numbing or even rashes that likely won’t go away without medical treatment; neither cause any serious side effects, however (except in the case of an allergic reaction). Lickilicky are known to constrict prey with their tongues, but almost never try this tactic on humans.","The toxic gases Koffing and Weezing are unavoidable products of their diets, unlike the poisonous trails of Grimer or Muk; they can cause coughing and sneezing in even small amounts. Consequently, gas masks or air purifiers are a must when raising these Pokémon. As mentioned above, flames can cause them to explode. Their gases are easily combustible, so one should never attempt to light anything in a room these Pokémon were recently in without proper ventilation.","The toxic gases Koffing and Weezing are unavoidable products of their diets, unlike the poisonous trails of Grimer or Muk; they can cause coughing and sneezing in even small amounts.

Their horns are sharp enough to pierce diamond; though trained racing Rhyhorn often have them dulled, their heavy weights still make them dangerous when angered. Rhydon and Rhyperior can also sweep foes with their heavy tails when angered, and can easily break bones with well-placed swings; luckily, they usually only attack when angered.","All members of this line are aggressive, but Rhyhorn are by far the most belligerent, charging on sight of unfamiliar objects.

None of them are aggressive or territorial in the least. Trainers should note, however, that Happiny are baby Pokémon and can be moody from time to time. They are stronger than they look and may throw their stones during tantrums. They are also known to unwittingly walk between the feet of people and accidentally trip them.","Obviously, the most pressing dangers these Pokémon possess are their copious vines. Trainers should stay wary in dense jungles, as these Pokémon often hide in bushes to snare passerby. Though Tangela are more annoying than threatening, they can still be dangerous if they happen to constrict the neck (though they more often go for the feet); Tangrowth are more hazardous, but will not hold on to large prey that struggle too much and will instead break off their vines.","It cannot be emphasized enough how protective mother Kangaskhan are of their offspring. They will risk their lives to defend their children from what they perceive to be threats. Travelers should give these Pokémon a wide berth. It should also be noted that Kangaskhan babies playing out in the open normally aren’t abandoned; their mothers are often hiding just a short distance away, keeping close watch on their children.","All members of this family will spit ink when threatened, which, though nontoxic, can stain skin and fabric if not removed quickly. Seadra spines leak muscle-paralyzing poison. They can be particularly dangerous for swimmers, as their poison acts quickly and has led to the drownings of a number of victims. Both Seadra and Kingdra can generate whirlpools; Kingdra are particularly active during storms, and have been known to inadvertently suck down ships while catching food.","All members of this family will spit ink when threatened, which, though nontoxic, can stain skin and fabric if not removed quickly.

Not only are their horns capable of shattering glass with ease, but their leaping abilities allow them to easily escape most commercially-available tanks. Their horns can maim unwary swimmers. These Pokémon are only aggressive in the autumn, however, when they breed and subsequently defend their eggs.","Though many people are captivated by the bright and vivid colorations of these Pokémon, they should not be kept in domestic aquariums by amateur hobbyists.

Mime Jr. are known to target people they sense are benevolent when performing for food, a skill that makes them popular among beggars. Mr. Mime will become angry if their performances are interrupted, slapping offenders with their huge hands. Their invisible walls can also be nuisances in crowded streets, though most Mr. Mime know that blocking traffic won’t help them earn food.","Scyther are aggressive and dangerous Pokémon, particularly because they are usually found in packs. Even lone Scyther seem to be more aggressive than social ones. Scizor are more territorial than confrontational, and will threaten intruders with the eyes on their pincers before lunging to attack. Though Scyther tend to be more threatening to humans, both Pokémon should be given wide berths in the wild to avoid angering them.","When uncomfortably hot, Smoochum will become very cranky. Spicy foods will cause these Pokémon great distress, as their lips are particularly sensitive and have many nerve endings.","All Pokémon in this line can deliver high-voltage shocks. Trainers should never stick their hands between an Elekid’s prongs, as an electric current will run through them whenever it charges. Electabuzz and Electivire are aggressive and will sometimes give chase if threatened. Touching an Electabuzz’s or Electivire’s horns or the latter’s twin tails is also not recommended. These Pokémon can also cause power outages if they drain too much electricity from a generator.","As Pokémon that can expel searing-hot flames, trainers should naturally be extremely careful around them. Luckily, they generally inhabit the craters of active volcanoes, where few trainers would be able to venture anyways. Additionally, they are not aggressive or even territorial. Despite this, travelers should give any stray individuals they come across a wide berth, as both Magmar and Magmortar can radiate significant heat even while standing still.","Wild Pinsir tend to only go after prey they believe they can easily take down. However, they are easily provoked, and will not hesitate to chase travelers who accidentally disturb them. One should never run from a Pinsir, as they will quickly follow in pursuit. Attempting to appear larger and more intimidating is instead a more effective maneuver. Pinsir can easily climb trees, so seeking refuge in the treetops is also not advised.","Wild Tauros are aggressive and will stampede in herds towards foreign threats. Both wild and domesticated Pokémon are angered by the color red and will charge on sight towards anything of this color. They only charge in straight lines, however, so they are relatively easy to avoid. Lone Tauros are known to tackle down trees or even power lines if they are unable to find anything else to headbutt in their spare time.","As one would expect, Magikarp are arguably one of the least threatening Pokémon to be around. They essentially pose no threat to people. On the other hand, Gyarados are one of the most dangerous Pokémon the majority of trainers will encounter. They are brutal and destructive, rampaging whenever angered. Inexperienced trainers should never confront an enraged Gyarados; instead, it is advised that one should run away as far as possible from the water’s edge.","As one would expect, Magikarp are arguably one of the least threatening Pokémon to be around.

There have been no recorded cases of Lapras, wild or trained, intentionally attacking a person without being provoked. Even riding on a Lapras’s back is a relatively safe method of transportation, as they always keep a close eye on their passengers and will quickly come to the rescue of those who accidentally fall off. ","Ditto are not actively hostile towards people. They prefer to hide from threats rather than confronting them. With that being said, however, they have the potential to be anything from complete non-threats to life-threatening dangers depending on what they transform into. For example, there has been at least one reported incident of a spooked Ditto turning into a spinning blade in the middle of a crowded stadium.","Though not aggressive towards humans, each Eeveelution does bring along the expected hazards of their typing. A few do have some unexpected dangers, however. Both Jolteon and Umbreon can bristle their fur to make their hairs sharp enough to pierce the skin. Similarly, Leafeon are able to stiffen their leaves to make them surprisingly sharp. Umbreon will sweat poison from their pores when threatened. Finally, Sylveon’s feelers can be choking hazards for young children.","Though not aggressive towards humans, each Eeveelution does bring along the expected hazards of their typing.

Famously, there was an incident in which a Porygon in a computer caused the screen to flash violently, triggering seizures in the children watching it. The bug has never reoccured, though the event scared much of the public away from training Porygon. Porygon-Z can be uncontrollable when glitching and may attack recklessly while doing so.","Omanyte are intelligent, but quiet, Pokémon that most trainers should have little problem with. Though they appear menacing, Omastar are similarly perceptive; however, they are quicker to attack when confronted, firing their spikes from a distance. They will watch approaching threats intently before shooting to discern their intentions. As long as swimmers don’t make sudden movements, they are unlikely to trigger these Pokémon to attack.","Omanyte are intelligent, but quiet, Pokémon that most trainers should have little problem with.

They are known to aim for the face; since these Pokémon are extinct in the wild, however, Kabuto attacks are not common. Kabutops, similarly, are not seen in the wild. Though vicious and aggressive, any Kabutops a trainer may come across on his or her journey is likely domesticated, and as such should not pose much of a problem.","Kabuto are not picky parasites, and will latch onto whatever suitable victims swim by.

These Pokémon are not particularly territorial. However, they will keep a close eye on foreign intruders that approach them, and will dive at them if they come too close to scare them off. They will attack threats that do not back off after their warning dives.","Munchlax will squeeze themselves through open windows and pet doors to make their ways into houses, where they will proceed to eat everything edible that they can find. Snorlax are infamous for falling asleep in the middle of pathways, blocking roads. They can be awoken peacefully by the sound of Poké Flutes. Trainers are advised to not attempt to wake them in other ways, as they will become very aggressive when disturbed through other methods.","","","","Dratini are very timid and will hide when confronted; they will not even attack when threatened. Dragonair also dislike conflict. However, they will defend themselves when cornered. In addition to being able to utilize a number of Dragon-type techniques, these Pokémon can also alter the weather to create storms and buy time to escape. Dragonite are very benevolent, but will go on destructive rampages when they are angered (though luckily, it takes a lot to enrage them).","Dratini are very timid and will hide when confronted; they will not even attack when threatened.

However, it should be noted that the fragrances members of this family emit can sometimes be overpowering for those with sensitive senses of smell. The fragrance Bayleef emit can make those around them act not only more energetically, but also more aggressively. Meganium’s anthers will seasonally release pollen that can trigger allergies in some individuals.","The Chikorita family is docile and a great choice for most beginning, inexperienced trainers.

For this reason, holding a nervous Cyndaquil without proper protection is not a good idea. Quilava are also cautious and quick to attack new stimuli with their flames.

Unfortunately, their playing almost always involves biting, so trainers should wear thick protection when first training these Pokémon; they will also bite to investigate novel things. Croconaw are not particularly aggressive, but will attack if they feel threatened. Feraligatr are territorial and may briefly chase travelers that encroach on their land, but they normally cease their pursuits once their threats have fled.","Totodile are very rambunctious Pokémon that love playing.

Spooked Furret are known to run between the legs of their attackers while fleeing in hopes of tripping them and buying themselves time to escape. It should also be noted that owning clothing or other goods made of Furret fur is illegal, though it is unlikely that a person would come across such a product without specifically seeking it out. ","These Pokémon pose little danger to humans, preferring to flee from confrontation instead of attacking.

Because of their large, glowing eyes and tendency to not blink for long periods of time, flocks of Hoothoot have been known to induce stress and paranoia in lost forest travelers, staring endlessly at them for hours at a time.

Angering a Ledyba swarm is difficult because they are quick to fly away when threatened. Ledian are more defensive and may strike foes with punches if cornered, but also prefer to flee if able to. These Pokémon can be nuisances to amateur gardeners, as large swarms of them can consume most of the standing plants in a plot with ease.","The Ledyba family is docile with reported harmful incidents involving humans at a minimum.

Numbness and pain are normal symptoms following a Spinarak bite, and while treatment can speed up the healing process, most people can recover without external help. Ariados venom, however, can be quickly fatal; carrying Antidotes is strongly advised when traveling in areas where Ariados are known to dwell, particularly at night.

In addition to being poisonous, both Pokémon can use moves like Confuse Ray and Supersonic to disorient travelers. Golbat are known to suck blood from spelunkers foolish enough to sleep in their territory. It should go without saying that cavern explorers should remember to pack plenty of repels. Crobat for the most part are not aggressive to humans.","Neither Chinchou nor Lanturn are aggressive Pokémon; Lanturn, in fact, seem to be very friendly towards people, sometimes lighting the way for boats at night or scaring hostile Pokémon away from stranded sailors. Both Pokémon wield electrical powers of moderate voltage, however, that can be potentially dangerous to humans. Because of the conductivity of seawater, swimming alongside these Pokémon is ill-advised.","Neither Chinchou nor Lanturn are aggressive Pokémon; Lanturn, in fact, seem to be very friendly towards people, sometimes lighting the way for boats at night or scaring hostile Pokémon away from stranded sailors.

Pikachu and Raichu will shock threats with only enough voltage to stun them--however, they are easily spooked, so trainers should be careful when approaching them. Touching their cheek pouches will also result in shocks. More caution should be taken with Pichu, who cannot control their electricity; luckily, their jolts tend to be milder than those of their evolutions. Forests with many Pikachu are more prone to thunderstorms due to the","Clefairy are known for their kleptomania, as they seem to steal ordinary objects like keys, flash drives, and calculators for no discernible reason--even from their trainers. Valuable objects should be kept out of reach or locked up in safes. These Pokémon are very timid and hate conflict; however, they may defend themselves with Metronome when threatened, which by nature makes them extremely unpredictable and potentially very dangerous.","Overall, the Igglybuff line is a great choice for starting trainers because their rubbery bodies allow them to bounce back from wear and tear and their affinities for people make them easy to raise. They pose little threat to humans because of their light weights. Trainers should be wary of Jigglypuff, however; falling asleep during one of their singing performances will anger them and trigger them to slap their audiences awake.","There have been no documented cases of these Pokémon harming or even attempting to harm humans. At most, the crying of young Togepi can be very irritating for those nearby, as the sound’s frequency is rather close to that of the crying of human children. In an unpleasant cycle, the annoyance of those around them makes Togepi cry even more. Overdosing on joy dust has been known to trigger effects similar to those achieved through consumption of MDMA.","There have been no documented cases of these Pokémon harming or even attempting to harm humans.

They will often hop on the shoes of travelers as if they were tree roots. There have been reports of explorers going insane from being endlessly watched by flocks of unblinking Natu. The interpretations of messages from Xatu seem to cause more harm than the Pokémon themselves, with one famous (false) prediction of the apocalypse in the 21st century triggering all sorts of odd behavior in believers.","Both of these Pokémon don’t seem to react at all to the presence of humans, though Natu can be a bit curious at times.

Azurill travel by swinging their tails around like lassos, and can cause small bruises if they accidentally hit someone. A single crying Azurill can also cause an entire group of them to cry, becoming very shrill and grating. Azumarill are surprisingly strong for their size and should not be underestimated because of their friendly natures.","These Pokémon are very friendly both to other Pokémon and to humans; wild Azumarill will even go out of their way to rescue drowning individuals.

When frightened, they will throw their heavy bodies at their attackers, which can result in broken bones. Sudowoodo will also charge blindly in any direction to escape water. Though easily scared, these Pokémon are otherwise rather docile and are not aggressive towards humans; most injuries involving them result from unwary gardeners watering them and being tackled as they flee.","Staring into the swirls on the bellies of any stage of this line other than Politoed can put a person in a trancelike-state. No members of this family are aggressive or dangerous to humans, making them excellent Pokémon for beginning trainers. Poliwrath, however, are very strong, and can strike with powerful punches when agitated.","None of these Pokémon are aggressive or actively harmful to humans; they dislike conflict and prefer to float away on the wind instead of attacking. Jumpluff spores can trigger allergies in some people, which can get particularly bad during their mating season. Hoppip greens are edible, but are incredibly bitter unless they are boiled first. If cornered or trapped, these Pokémon can also release a number of powder-based moves to scare off opponents.","None of these Pokémon are aggressive or actively harmful to humans; they dislike conflict and prefer to float away on the wind instead of attacking.

They may sometimes steal the hats of travelers passing underneath for fun, but will usually return them once they become bored. They will toss the husks and shells of fruits and nuts that they shuck aimlessly, sometimes hitting unwary people and Pokémon below. Trainers should be wary that angering a single Pokémon will anger the whole colony, making all of the members irate and aggressive.","Sunkern are harmless to humans; in fact, because of their frailty and small size, people are generally more of a danger to them than vice versa. During warm summers after cold winters, populations of these Pokémon can explode and be a temporary nuisance as large numbers of them swarm about. Sunflora are friendly Pokémon, but can unleash powerful sun-based attacks like Solar Beam if angered (most commonly by an unwary being blocking their access to sunlight).","Sunkern are harmless to humans; in fact, because of their frailty and small size, people are generally more of a danger to them than vice versa.

They should not be trifled with, however, as they can create shock waves that can permanently damage hearing and shatter glass. Yanmega, on the other hand, are aggressive; their shock waves can break bones and their jaws can easily tear off limbs. These Pokémon are strong enough to carry away adult humans and should be treated with extreme caution.","Wooper are coated in a poisonous film that can cause searing pain upon contact. The film leaves no other lasting effects, but is nevertheless unpleasant to touch. They lose their poison upon evolution. They are very friendly Pokémon, however, and will readily splash about with new people and Pokémon. Quagsire are also incredibly docile, though they seem to ignore strangers or stare at them instead of engage with them; they are very difficult to provoke or anger.","Wooper are coated in a poisonous film that can cause searing pain upon contact.

A few do have some unexpected dangers, however. Both Jolteon and Umbreon can bristle their fur to make their hairs sharp enough to pierce the skin. Similarly, Leafeon are able to stiffen their leaves to make them surprisingly sharp. Umbreon will sweat poison from their pores when threatened. Finally, Sylveon’s feelers can be choking hazards for young children.","Though not aggressive towards humans, each Eeveelution does bring along the expected hazards of their typing.

They will often try to steal shiny items from people, including rings, necklaces, and other forms of jewelry. If threatened, Murkrow will attack in flocks with their beaks and talons. Though Honchkrow are capable of being very threatening alone, they rarely attack; instead will, they order their Murkrow cronies to overwhelm those that annoy them.","Since no Pokémon in this family are very active, they pose virtually no danger to humans. Though they possess psychic abilities of varying strength, they rarely exert the energy to utilize them except when in battle. Slowking are very friendly with humans, acting as mentors or gurus in some cases. It should be noted that the Shellder attached to these Pokémon can become defensive when their hosts (and food supplies) and endangered, however. ","Misdreavus are tricksters and have many ways of scaring forest travelers; carrying a torch or flashlight is recommended to keep them at bay. Their shrieks can be heard from far away, however, so trainers should cover their ears as soon as they hear them to block out their unnerving cries. Mismagius tend to ignore humans. They may curse those that anger them with hallucinations or headaches using their incantations, however; light sources will also ward off wild Mismagius.","Although Unown do not seem to be hostile, it is difficult to determine their dispositions because of their perplexing natures. Harming a wild Unown will cause the whole swarm to rush to its defense, causing all sorts of unknown effects. Vandalizing the ruins and temples these Pokémon call home is also ill-advised; there have been reports of people being teleported to remote locations without their memories or even disappearing entirely for defacing Unown habitats.","Roughhousing with either of these Pokémon not recommended, as they will retaliate with proportionally stronger forces. They are also highly protective of their tails; Wobbuffet will even take proactive measures to defend their tails if they feel they may be in danger (something they almost never do). Wynaut will squeeze up against others to play, which may cause bruises. Finally, some people find their repetitive vocalizations irksome, particularly when both Pokémon are together.","Never approach a wild or fellow trainer’s Girafarig from behind, as their rear heads will almost certainly bite. Because their rear heads work based on smell, wearing perfume or other strong-smelling substances will cause even trained Girafarig to attack, as the substane would mask the familiar scent. If the rear head must ever be placated for some reason, trainers should distract it with a flashing light; they can only focus on one object at a time because of their primitive brains.","Disturbing trees with Pineco colonies is ill-advised, as they will drop from their branches and explode to send fragments of bark flying everywhere at high speeds. Endangered Forretress will also react similarly, but will release sharp metal shrapnel instead. Forretress will also periodically dislodge chips of their shell onto the ground below, which are sharp and can pierce the soles of shoes as well as automobile and bike tires; they may also shoot these broken pieces at intruders.","Disturbing trees with Pineco colonies is ill-advised, as they will drop from their branches and explode to send fragments of bark flying everywhere at high speeds.

Because of their habitats, they are rarely sighted by everyday travelers. Trained Dunsparce, however, can cause damage to hardwood floors and carpets if they are kept indoors, as they will try to burrow underground when scared. Some believe that Dunsparce are venomous, injecting venom through their chin growths or bites. This is entirely untrue; Dunsparce in fact are completely toothless.","Neither of these Pokémon are the safest Pokémon for trainers to raise, but they can be very affectionate with those they trust. Trainers should obviously be careful around their pincers and stingers. Wild Gligar are known to attack the faces of trainers passing nearby, so travelers should be wary when passing through their nesting areas. Gliscor are large enough to attack small Pokémon and trainers; they navigate by echolocation and can be disoriented with high-pitched whistles.","Neither of these Pokémon are particularly aggressive, though Steelix are slightly more confrontational than their pre-evolutions. These Pokémon are commonly encountered in subterranean environments, where their large statures can sometimes unintentionally make them hazards, especially in tight tunnels. Their tunneling is also known to cause earthquakes and weaken foundations when too many intersecting tunnels are burrowed underneath structures.","Neither of these Pokémon are aggressive, so they don’t pose much of a threat to humans. Startled Snubbull and especially solitary Granbull will bare their fangs, but they almost inevitably will flee when push comes to shove. Granbull are fiercely protective of their friends and family, however, and should not be trifled with; if they sense their loved ones being threatened, they will attack ferociously with their powerful fangs to defend them.","Neither of these Pokémon are aggressive, so they don’t pose much of a threat to humans.

In fact, they tend to ignore most beings that aren’t other Qwilfish, as their venom and spikes provide them with more than enough protection against potential threats. They will begin to puff up and fill themselves with water if they feel threatened, preparing to launch their spikes. Trainers should have ample time to escape if they see this, as it takes them a bit of time to fully inflate.","Scyther are aggressive and dangerous Pokémon, particularly because they are usually found in packs. Even lone Scyther seem to be more aggressive than social ones. Scizor are more territorial than confrontational, and will threaten intruders with the eyes on their pincers before lunging to attack. Though Scyther tend to be more threatening to humans, both Pokémon should be given wide berths in the wild to avoid angering them.","These Pokémon are practically harmless to humans, as they are slow and will hide in their shells if threatened. Although Shuckle juices are highly valued, it is not recommended to drink the juice of any wild Shuckle. Not only does this deplete the wild Pokémon’s emergency food reserve, but the juice may also be poisonous, depending on what Berries it has stored and how long it has fermented--factors that are controlled in commercial Berry Juice and other juice productions.","Although Heracross are very easy-going, they will quickly become enraged if they are interrupted while feeding on tree sap. They will not hesitate to charge at those that bother them too much, launching foes far away with tremendous force. Trainers should leave wild Heracross alone in the wild, particularly if they are feeding. As one might expect, a rampaging Heracross can be calmed with an offering of Combee Honey.","Wild Sneasel and Weavile should be treated with much caution, as they are agile Pokémon with sharp claws. There have been recorded incidents of Weavile packs going after weary mountain travelers. Strength in numbers is the best defense against Weavile; even the strongest lone fighter can be overwhelmed by an entire pack. These Pokémon dislike extended fights, and will flee if they cannot take down their target quickly enough.","Young Teddiursa pose little to no threat in the wild. They are curious and may even approach humans they spot in the woods to investigate the new creatures. Approaching Teddiursa, or allowing one to approach, however, should be avoided at all costs; their parents are very protective of them and can easily maul those that threaten their offspring. Ursaring are territorial and will also attack perceived threats to their land, but will leave peaceful travelers alone for the most part.","Young Teddiursa pose little to no threat in the wild.

Individuals that have already been treated are still very hot to the touch, and can still cause moderate burns. It goes without saying that they should not be kept in wooden homes or around flammable materials.","These Pokémon, at least wild-caught ones, are not at all recommended for beginning or even intermediate trainers; though very docile (they have virtually no enemies in the wild), they require extensive care prior to even being brought to human settlements.

Piloswine act similarly, but are much heavier; they can cause significant injuries in a collision. They will also charge if they feel threatened or frightened by sounds they cannot locate the source of.

They aren’t aggressive and prefer to use their hard bodies to shrug off attacks rather than fight back. However, cornered Corsola may launch off their branches using Spike Cannon if left with no other option. Entire colonies will work together to ward off intruders, so tormenting a seemingly-harmless individual in a reef is very ill-advised.","Remoraid have sharp teeth and will defend their Mantine hosts viciously. In areas with few Mantine, sailors have recorded entire schools of Remoraid attaching to the undersides of their ships and slowing them down. These Pokémon can also shoot water with great force, so even individuals should be treated with caution. Octillery are curious but territorial and will defend themselves with blasts of water and ink. They will attack more fiercely the closer threats get to their small nests.","Remoraid have sharp teeth and will defend their Mantine hosts viciously.

Wild Delibird are will go out of their way to help out travelers that they come across, gifting them with food and supplies from their tails. Children in particular love Delibird, as these Pokémon seem to uncannily know what gifts children like best. In the off chance that a traveler spooks a wild Delibird, it will use Present to fling the contents of its tail; rocks and other hard objects can potentially cause harm.","Mantyke are very friendly; even wild ones will approach humans with little fear. However, they are also large and heavy, especially for a baby Pokémon; some people have been knocked off their surfboards and kayaks after being tackled by overeager Mantyke. Mantine are gentle giants and seem to completely ignore boats or swimming humans. However, they cannot easily stop after launching themselves into the air, so sailors should be cautious of “flying” schools of Mantine. ","Luckily, trainers rarely encounter these Pokémon in the wild, and those lost in the bleak badlands they call home often have more pressing matters on their hands--like finding food and shelter. These territorial Pokémon prefer to attack smaller prey if given a choice, but starving Skarmory will go after practically anything that moves. It is difficult to fight against or flee from these swift fliers, so trainers should simply stay out of their territories unless they are prepared.","Trainers should avoid packs of these Pokémon in the wild, as they are both territorial and aggressive. They are opportunistic hunters that will chase any prey they believe they can overpower. Because of this, running is a poor choice if one happens to cross paths with a wild pack. Instead, one should stand his or her ground and look as menacing as possible; brandishing a weapon or sending out a strong-looking Pokémon should be enough to cause a pack to back down.  ","Trainers should avoid packs of these Pokémon in the wild, as they are both territorial and aggressive.

Seadra spines leak muscle-paralyzing poison. They can be particularly dangerous for swimmers, as their poison acts quickly and has led to the drownings of a number of victims. Both Seadra and Kingdra can generate whirlpools; Kingdra are particularly active during storms, and have been known to inadvertently suck down ships while catching food.","Although they are playful and very friendly, Phanpy should not be raised by young children or inexperienced trainers; they can accidentally, but severely injure people while playing because of their great strength. Similarly, trainers should avoid Phanpy in the wild even if they approach, because they aren’t aware of their might. Wild Donphan herd tend to ignore trainers as long as they don’t get in their way, but threatening one member will cause the whole herd to “charge.”","Although they are playful and very friendly, Phanpy should not be raised by young children or inexperienced trainers; they can accidentally, but severely injure people while playing because of their great strength.

Wild Donphan herd tend to ignore trainers as long as they don’t get in their way, but threatening one member will cause the whole herd to “charge.”","Neither Porygon nor Porygon2 pose any particular threat to humans in the real world. Famously, there was an incident in which a Porygon in a computer caused the screen to flash violently, triggering seizures in the children watching it. The bug has never reoccured, though the event scared much of the public away from training Porygon. Porygon-Z can be uncontrollable when glitching and may attack recklessly while doing so.","Stantler appear harmless and aloof; however, they should not be approached by unskilled trainers, whether alone or in a herd. Young, isolated Stantler will create powerful illusions of stampedes that can cause even the most composed people to panic. The antlers of these Pokémon are mesmerizing, so trainers should avoid staring into the black orbs on them. Spooked Stantler herds will actually stampede, and it does not take much to scare these restless creatures.","Wild Smeargle normally are not a great danger towards humans. Smeargle territory is easily recognizable by the brightly-painted trees that outline it. They are not threatened by people, however, and will not attack unless attacked first. Threatening wild Smeargle is very ill-advised, though. They can learn almost any attack known to man and will use them with impunity to defend themselves. Comrade Smeargle will also quickly come to the aid of their distressed brethren.","The Tyrogue family is well-suited for life among people, and are a common sight in dojos and gyms. Their main source of concern is their superb fighting techniques. However, they are just as skilled in restraining themselves in combat, so people should have no problem fighting alongside or even against them in training.","The Tyrogue family is well-suited for life among people, and are a common sight in dojos and gyms.

Spicy foods will cause these Pokémon great distress, as their lips are particularly sensitive and have many nerve endings.","All Pokémon in this line can deliver high-voltage shocks. Trainers should never stick their hands between an Elekid’s prongs, as an electric current will run through them whenever it charges. Electabuzz and Electivire are aggressive and will sometimes give chase if threatened. Touching an Electabuzz’s or Electivire’s horns or the latter’s twin tails is also not recommended. These Pokémon can also cause power outages if they drain too much electricity from a generator.","As Pokémon that can expel searing-hot flames, trainers should naturally be extremely careful around them. Luckily, they generally inhabit the craters of active volcanoes, where few trainers would be able to venture anyways. Additionally, they are not aggressive or even territorial. Despite this, travelers should give any stray individuals they come across a wide berth, as both Magmar and Magmortar can radiate significant heat even while standing still.","Domestic Miltank are calm and slow to anger. They pose little threat even to children, which is why they are often seen at petting zoos. Wild Miltank are usually descended from escaped domestic ones, and almost always are just as docile. Angry Miltank are something to be feared, however. They can barrel at foes by rolling down slopes at incredibly high speeds, knocking them far away. Hooligans that try to mess with Miltank often are traumatized by the experiences that follow.","","","","","None of these Pokémon should be approached in the wild. Larvitar are rarely seen, but sighting one inevitably means the mother is nearby; trainers should immediately run if they see a Larvitar emerging from the ground. Pupitar will trigger rockslides by thrashing about if threatened; they can also launch their heavy bodies with high speed at attackers. Tyranitar are one of the most fearsome Pokémon known to man. Trainers should stay far away from known Tyranitar territory.","None of these Pokémon should be approached in the wild.

Wild individuals are more wary of people; Treecko and Grovyle won’t attack unless attacked first, but may aggressively approach strangers by leaping from tree to tree to scare them off. Sceptile will passionately defend their homes; they will attack those who try to cut branches or fell trees in their territories. Those who leave the forest alone can pass through unharmed, though.","Trained Pokémon of this family pose little threat to humans, as they are easygoing and hard to anger.

Combusken and Blaziken are not hostile, but do not like being approached by strangers; they may defend themselves with powerful kicks if trainers try to come too near. Torchic are very easily startled and may spew small embers as they attempt to escape; these cinders can spark brushfires in dry grasslands, so trainers should also be wary of spooking them.","Wild members of the Torchic line are rare.

Swampert nest on beaches or near estuaries; they are protective of their nests, so trainers should not approach them. If one sees a Swampert building up a barricade of boulders, a storm is likely coming; one should find cover immediately.","Mudkip are cute and friendly, but are also deceptively strong for their size.

They will not attempt to attack foes that they think can fight back. Wild Poochyena will flee if their target does not cower in front of them, and packs of Mightyena usually won’t pursue a foe that stands his or her ground. Weakness is the worst thing one can display when confronting these Pokémon. Running will only encourage them to give chase, so trainers should stay put and seem as imposing as possible.","These Pokémon are often aggressive, but they are also opportunists.

Zigzagoon will flee or play dead when scared, and are considered more of a pest than a danger in urban areas because they often knock over trash cans while rummaging through them. Linoone also prefer to flee from danger with their great speed. If cornered, though, they may attack by headbutting the aggressor before dashing away. Because they can only run straight, however, they are relatively easy to dodge.","Neither of these Pokémon pose any significant threat to humans.

Lombre, however, are mischievous Pokémon that often mess with fishermen and travelers near the water’s edge. Spelon Berries will placate the pranksters and keep them at bay. Ludicolo are jolly creatures who usually diffuse tension through dance.

However, they hardly are dangerous Pokémon. Nuzleaf also rarely cause significant harm, but can induce deep paranoia with their tricks.

In flocks, they can pose a larger threat due to their greater numbers. They are also a pest to crops and Berry trees. Swellow are more docile, but can still be territorial.

Azurill travel by swinging their tails around like lassos, and can cause small bruises if they accidentally hit someone. A single crying Azurill can also cause an entire group of them to cry, becoming very shrill and grating. Azumarill are surprisingly strong for their size and should not be underestimated because of their friendly natures.","As one would expect, these Pokémon should be kept far away from anything metallic and valuable. They don’t actively seek to harm humans, but may attempt to draw in bicycles or even cars with magnetism fir their iron even as people are riding them. Compasses will malfunction when near these Pokémon; although they always point north, it can be extremely confusing when one is close enough to notice its effects on one’s compass without actually being able to see them.","These Pokémon pose virtually no threat to humans. For one, they are not confrontational and will flee from harm before fighting it. For another, they are very comfortable around humans. Delcatty in particular don’t even seem to have a way to defend themselves. They simply walk--not run--away from danger. Their trainers seem to be irrationally protective of them, however; perhaps a Delcatty’s greatest strength lies in its ability to charm humans into protecting them.","These Pokémon pose virtually no threat to humans.

They may sabotage valuable equipment and alter trails, making them potentially dangerous to be around. The best way to deter Sableye is to distract them with something more interesting--cheap children’s toys and puzzles can keep them occupied. These Pokémon can be very unnerving to some, causing psychological distress. They will also eat valuable gemstone jewelry if left unattended.","Wild Mawile normally don’t try to lure trainers near them, but brash Pokémon may try to approach these unassuming creatures before being surprised by their powerful horns. While they may seem meek, these Pokémon are scrappy fighters if cornered. They will not hesitate to lock their false jaws onto vulnerable body parts and limbs. Mawile dislike confrontation with large foes, however, and will usually try to scare them off with their horns before biting.","Aron are a huge pest in the mining industry, swarming around exposed iron ore and even eating metallic mining equipment.

They are known to leap out of the water before diving back down, creating huge splashes that can capsize boats.

These slow-witted, docile Pokémon pose little danger to humans. Camerupt are not aggressive, but also don’t pay much attention to what is around them when they erupt. Trainers should give them a wide berth to prevent severe injury. Camerupt will also become enraged when hit in the face, charging about and spewing lava everywhere.","Although Numel are full of magma, one would not even notice while riding one because of how well-insulated their humps are.

They store coal that they find in their hollow shells, where they can then burn it to produce smoke, which they use for communication and defense, as well as energy.","Wild Spoink aren’t very dangerous to people. They can be a nuisance when they try to steal round objects like Poké Balls or pearl jewelry to place on their heads. Grumpig seldom attack humans directly; however, they can manipulate other Pokémon into defending them if threatened, or even persuade travelers to turn around and leave. They rarely try to cause any more harm than is necessary to defuse the threat, however.","Wild Spoink aren’t very dangerous to people.

They rarely even seem to be coherent enough to notice threats, let alone defend themselves. Their lurching and stumbling can cause extreme dizziness in those that try to watch them. This is especially effective in large numbers, as watching group of teetering Spinda can cause a person to keel over in disorientation. As long as one doesn’t stare at these Pokemon for too long, they should not pose much of a danger when traveling.","Trapinch pits can be hazardous for travelers; though these Pokémon don’t actively hunt people, they will bite pretty much anything that falls into their pits. Tipping them headfirst will prevent them from biting or getting up. Vibrava’s wings produce earsplitting sonic waves that can stun people, so trainers may need to wear earplugs to prevent loss of hearing; they can also spew acid to defend themselves from threats.

Cacturne are inactive during the day, but strike fear in the hearts of desert trainers at night. If pursued by a Cacturne group, the best approach is to frequently look back; they will not approach while they know they are being watched.

Altaria also are very peaceful Pokémon that try to soothe aggression before it leads to danger. They are more than capable of protecting themselves with attacks if necessary, however, though they will try defensive options before offensive ones.","These Pokémon don’t pose much of a threat to people.

While they won’t go out of their way to scare off travelers from their territory, they will not flee if accidentally approached. If they come across humans, they will stand their ground and prepare for battle. Trainers should back away slowly if they find a wild Zangoose; they will not chase foes that retreat. It goes without saying that trainers should recall their Seviper when travelling through Zangoose territory.","Many travelers fear encountering wild Seviper. They are often hidden by the the tall grasses in which they dwell. Seviper do not actively try to bite humans, though; most attacks result when unwary travelers nearly step on these Pokémon. Obviously, their tails, fangs, and venom make them very well-equipped to defend themselves, and people should give them a wide berth if they are spotted. Finally, trainers should recall their Zangoose when transversing Seviper territory.","While these Pokémon don’t appear to intentionally seek to cause humans harm, travelers should be at least somewhat wary of them. Lunatone strike fear into onlookers with their red eyes; they can paralyze or even knock out those that stare for too long. Solrock can blind foes with bright flashes of light or overwhelm them with intense heat. They seem to guard meteorites aggressively, attacking those that try to pick up debris from crash sites.","While these Pokémon don’t appear to intentionally seek to cause humans harm, travelers should be at least somewhat wary of them.

Whiscash are more dangerous than their pre-evolutions, though. They are temperamental and territorial, quickly becoming angry when strangers approach their ponds.

Crawdaunt are even more aggressive, clamping onto and tossing out any non-Corphish organisms from the waters. The ecological damage these Pokémon cause is by far their most destructive characteristic.

However, they seem to act as sentries of sorts in the desert ruins where they are often found, alerting nearby Claydol of intruders. Claydol themselves are formidable foes; they can fire powerful beams from their arms or spin rapidly to whip up sandstorms.

Regardless, these Pokémon are surprisingly benign. Anorith will remain hidden between rocks when humans swim by, as they won’t go after foes larger than themselves. Armaldo also prefer to leave people alone; they are hardly aggressive, though they will become anxious if approached.","As with all other fossil Pokémon, Anorith and Armaldo are no longer found in the wild, so trainers rarely have to worry about encountering them.

Weak Feebas are unable to even defend themselves when attacked, let alone provoke others. Milotic also embody the very opposite of conflict; their auras soothe aggression, so it is unlikely that fights will break out when around these Pokémon.

As such, they pose practically no threat to people. Castform are almost never found in the wild, so the vast majority of encounters one will have with them will be with trained individuals. They are a mild-mannered species that dislike conflict. Though they can harness the weather around them to defend themselves with the attack Weather Ball, they usually flee before having to do so.","Kecleon are not particularly dangerous Pokémon in the wild. They do not attack without being provoked, and trainers usually will pass right by them without even noticing. Sometimes, these Pokémon can be minor nuisances when they decide to hide themselves in the middle of major pathways, as they won’t move unless attacked. Kecleon are very possessive Pokémon, however, that will fiercely attack those that try to steal what they have claimed as their own.","Shuppet are mischievous Pokémon that play pranks on passerby to feed on the resulting negative emotions. However, they can easily be scared away by a flashlight. Banette can be more menacing, but rarely attack people unless provoked. According to popular legend, Banette will only attack the children that had abandoned them long ago, cursing them by piercing themselves with needles. One should never unzip the mouth of a Banette; doing so will greatly enrage them.","Shuppet are mischievous Pokémon that play pranks on passerby to feed on the resulting negative emotions.

Duskull may surprise people and cause them to drop their flashlights, however; under no circumstances should one look them directly in their eyes. Dusknoir seem to have their own agendas, only pursuing those that they must.

They gladly will share their fruit with strangers, especially human children. They are fiercely protective, however, of the trees that grow their fruit; they will attack those those that try to cut down these trees or harvest all of the fruit without leaving any behind for others. Tropius also release pollen from their necks in the spring that can trigger allergies in some people.","These Pokémon usually do not harm humans. They are not aggressive and will not attack travelers simply for being near them. However, they are a meek species that will quickly become frightened if they feel threatened. Both evolutions can emit shrill earsplitting cries that can deafen enemies; Chingling’s defensive cry is said to be especially discordant, while Chimecho’s is reputed to be wholly unsettling.","Absol are very rarely encountered in the wild. These Pokémon can sense when people are approaching and usually stay far away from people. They are usually only ever encountered when they intentionally are trying to warn people of a disaster. Because of this, seeing an Absol is a good sign that one should turn back and leave immediately. These Pokémon will defend themselves with their horns if necessary, but usually flee from conflict rather than stand their ground.","Roughhousing with either of these Pokémon not recommended, as they will retaliate with proportionally stronger forces. They are also highly protective of their tails; Wobbuffet will even take proactive measures to defend their tails if they feel they may be in danger (something they almost never do). Wynaut will squeeze up against others to play, which may cause bruises. Finally, some people find their repetitive vocalizations irksome, particularly when both Pokémon are together.","These Pokémon are rarely sighted by people, as they dwell in remote, icy areas that are unsuitable for humans. Snorunt are playful creatures that rarely mean any harm; they may approach mountain travelers due to curiosity. Glalie tend to ignore humans entirely, though people should stay away from them because of their freezing abilities. Froslass are rumored to freeze travelers and display their frozen victims in caverns, though no reports of this have been confirmed.","These Pokémon are rarely sighted by people, as they dwell in remote, icy areas that are unsuitable for humans.

These rare Pokémon inhabit deep waters where crushing pressures prevent human divers from descending; they are so elusive that they were long thought to be extinct, after all. In the rare instance that one is encountered, it is likely that it will completely ignore nearby humans. If approached or touched, however, it will aggressively ram into the transgressor with Head Smash before swimming away.","Luvdisc pose no threat towards people. In fact, some contend that they are the most harmless Pokémon known to man. Large schools can sometimes pose a small nuisance to boats and submarines, as they may hamper travel as they pass by. Their bright coloration may draw unwanted attention to beachside couples, tinting the water near them in a bright pink. They can cause minor bruises as irked fishermen chuck them out to sea and accidentally hit passing swimmers.","The largest danger Bagon pose to humans results from their frequent dives from above. They don’t pay much attention to what is beneath them before they leap from cliffs and can severely injure unsuspecting travelers below when they land.

Both Pokémon can be nuisances to anglers, however, as they are smart enough to wait for fish to bite onto lures before snatching the catches away as their own. It is customary to feed resident Floatzel before fishing in a river to encourage them to stay around in the event an angler falls in and needs rescuing.","These Pokémon rarely attack humans, preferring to use their speed to escape danger.

Overcast Form Cherrim do not react to threats, instead choosing to hide in the treetops to avoid being seen. In their Sunshine Forms, though, these small Pokémon can be very formidable threats that can harness light into attacks like Solar Beam. They are usually friendly creatures, though, that will only attack if attacked first.","Cherubi are not very dangerous Pokémon, as they cannot do much to defend themselves without wasting the precious energy they are trying to conserve.

When touched or gripped, they will ooze a slippery purple fluid from their skin that not only allows them to escape attackers, but also lubricates their bodies so they can more easily slide into rocky crevices for protection. This fluid can cause mild to moderate irritation if left on the skin for prolonged periods of time.","These Pokémon prefer to flee from confrontation if given the chance, though they are not particularly speedy.

This fluid can cause mild to moderate irritation if left on the skin for prolonged periods of time.","These Pokémon are normally friendly, if a bit mischievous. They may sometimes steal the hats of travelers passing underneath for fun, but will usually return them once they become bored. They will toss the husks and shells of fruits and nuts that they shuck aimlessly, sometimes hitting unwary people and Pokémon below. Trainers should be wary that angering a single Pokémon will anger the whole colony, making all of the members irate and aggressive.","Although many popular legends warn of Drifloon and their penchant for whisking young children away to the land of the dead, it would take a large group of these Pokémon to lift a small child. Drifblim rarely interact with humans, instead electing to float solemnly high up in the sky. In the rare chance that they feel threatened, however, they can summon attacks like Ominous Wind to take down opponents.","Although many popular legends warn of Drifloon and their penchant for whisking young children away to the land of the dead, it would take a large group of these Pokémon to lift a small child.

Buneary can strike foes with their ears, leaving bruises and even broken bones. Lopunny can quickly and powerfully kick opponents in rapid succession before leaping away; they usually aim for the head and can cause severe trauma, so these Pokémon should not be approached or startled.","Both of these Pokémon are skittish and easily spooked; though they will try to run from opponents using their great agility, they can launch very strong attacks if cornered.

Their shrieks can be heard from far away, however, so trainers should cover their ears as soon as they hear them to block out their unnerving cries. Mismagius tend to ignore humans. They may curse those that anger them with hallucinations or headaches using their incantations, however; light sources will also ward off wild Mismagius.","Murkrow are often seen as bad omens; they are known to steal objects from travelers in forests and lead them astray. They will often try to steal shiny items from people, including rings, necklaces, and other forms of jewelry. If threatened, Murkrow will attack in flocks with their beaks and talons. Though Honchkrow are capable of being very threatening alone, they rarely attack; instead will, they order their Murkrow cronies to overwhelm those that annoy them.","Both Pokémon will not hesitate to claw at trainers that displease them; pet Glameow are often declawed to alleviate this. Even so, they may try to bite those around them when unhappy. Purugly will barge into homes unannounced and destroy everything around them. One should not confront a stray Purugly, as it will attack upon eye contact; calling Pokémon control services is a safer option. Making eye contact with Glameow is also ill-advised due to their hypnotic effect.","Both Pokémon will not hesitate to claw at trainers that displease them; pet Glameow are often declawed to alleviate this.

They are not aggressive and will not attack travelers simply for being near them. However, they are a meek species that will quickly become frightened if they feel threatened. Both evolutions can emit shrill earsplitting cries that can deafen enemies; Chingling’s defensive cry is said to be especially discordant, while Chimecho’s is reputed to be wholly unsettling.","Trainers should not approach these Pokémon in the wild unless they wish to be sprayed. Stunky will first stomp their feet, then hiss, and then finally raise their tails before spraying, giving threats plenty of time to back away and escape unharmed. Skuntank are much less judicious when it comes to spraying, however; most Poké Marts carry Skuntank deodorant to neutralize the smell. Though putrid, the compound is not particularly harmful upon contact.","Trainers should not approach these Pokémon in the wild unless they wish to be sprayed.

Individuals seem to ignore people entirely, even when directly approached. Bronzong dislike being rung by others; it is said that doing so will anger a Bronzong so much that it will prevent rainfall for seven years. These Pokémon also act oddly around fire; Bronzor will begin spinning around and Bronzong will ring themselves repeatedly. It is unknown whether this behavior is aggressive, but most find it very unsettling.","These Pokémon don’t seem to be much of a threat to humans.

When frightened, they will throw their heavy bodies at their attackers, which can result in broken bones. Sudowoodo will also charge blindly in any direction to escape water. Though easily scared, these Pokémon are otherwise rather docile and are not aggressive towards humans; most injuries involving them result from unwary gardeners watering them and being tackled as they flee.","Living alongside humans, neither Mime Jr. nor Mr. Mime pose much of a threat to people. Mime Jr. are known to target people they sense are benevolent when performing for food, a skill that makes them popular among beggars. Mr. Mime will become angry if their performances are interrupted, slapping offenders with their huge hands. Their invisible walls can also be nuisances in crowded streets, though most Mr. Mime know that blocking traffic won’t help them earn food.","These Pokémon are practically the opposite of dangerous, considering that they are staples in hospitals and Pokémon Centers in multiple regions. None of them are aggressive or territorial in the least. Trainers should note, however, that Happiny are baby Pokémon and can be moody from time to time. They are stronger than they look and may throw their stones during tantrums. They are also known to unwittingly walk between the feet of people and accidentally trip them.","Trainers should note that Chatot will indeed copy nearly any sound they hear: banging pots, crying infants, spousal bickering (which can be particularly irritating if exact phrases are repeated verbatim), and so on. In the wild, these Pokémon can squawk at volumes high enough to cause temporary deafness if threatened; they are also surprisingly scrappy fighters that will use their beaks and talons to defend themselves, sometimes even doing so before trying to fly away.","If one comes across an errant Odd Keystone, one should just let it be. Only the most advanced trainers should even attempt to approach it, as Spiritomb are wildly destructive within their radii. An Odd Keystone should never be moved unless the Spiritomb is being caught; it is said these Pokémon can control those with impure hearts, so those unsure of their own morality should not approach them. Under absolutely no circumstances should one ever destroy an Odd Keystone.","To put it bluntly, these Pokémon are rather terrifying. Gible are the least threatening of the line, but even they will bite with little provocation. Territorial Gabite viciously defend their gem hoards from anyone that even comes moderately close to them. Garchomp are thankfully rare in the wild, but they are also very aggressive and can fly at Mach speeds. Yache Berries are very strongly advised when traveling through their territory.","To put it bluntly, these Pokémon are rather terrifying.

Snorlax are infamous for falling asleep in the middle of pathways, blocking roads. They can be awoken peacefully by the sound of Poké Flutes. Trainers are advised to not attempt to wake them in other ways, as they will become very aggressive when disturbed through other methods.","These Pokémon rarely ever come into direct conflict with humans. Because they can sense the auras of those around them from a distance, they can detect hostile beings well before they come near. Riolu usually stay away from humans entirely, but Lucario can sometimes appear when they sense distress to help those in danger. Those that mean harm should not approach these Pokémon; Lucario will attack those with malicious auras, defending their loved ones fiercely.","These Pokémon rarely ever come into direct conflict with humans.

Hippowdon, however, are extremely aggressive. In fact, they are the most common cause of injuries amongst desert travelers. One should never make eye contact with these irate Pokémon. Backing slowly away with one’s head down hopefully should be enough to keep them at bay.","Hippopotas are actually rather docile Pokémon; they may whip up sandstorms to cloak themselves from enemies, but otherwise prefer to hide from threats rather than confront them.

Skorupi are not aggressive; in fact, they are quite skittish and will flee or burrow into the substrate if attacked. They are ambush attackers that won’t reveal themselves unless they feel immediately threatened. Drapion, though, are extremely aggressive and territorial. They will stop chasing foes that exit the boundaries of their domains, however. Regardless, Antidotes are a necessity when crossing Drapion land.","Trainers should exercise great caution around these Pokémon.

They will entirely ignore travelers unless they are directly attacked; when in danger, however, they are dirty fighters that will immediately go for their opponents’ vulnerable areas. Their poison is extremely potent, and one should seek immediate medical attention if they even so much as touch one of these creatures.","Although these Pokémon are highly poisonous, they thankfully are not at all aggressive.

It should be reassuring to know that Carnivine rarely try to clamp onto humans, as they are far too large; trying to snap would only waste precious energy. They are also passive Pokémon that don’t immediately lash out at threats; instead, they try to remain perfectly still to avoid detection.","Finneon are almost always found in large schools; trainers will most likely sight them near coral reefs, as the average person will not likely explore the trenches these Pokémon and their evolutions call home. They are not dangerous, even in large numbers; when attacked, they will swim away, flapping their tail fins and flashing their lights to confuse attackers. Lumineon can use attacks like Silver Wind to defend themselves, but usually choose to avoid confrontation entirely. ","Finneon are almost always found in large schools; trainers will most likely sight them near coral reefs, as the average person will not likely explore the trenches these Pokémon and their evolutions call home.

However, they are also large and heavy, especially for a baby Pokémon; some people have been knocked off their surfboards and kayaks after being tackled by overeager Mantyke. Mantine are gentle giants and seem to completely ignore boats or swimming humans. However, they cannot easily stop after launching themselves into the air, so sailors should be cautious of “flying” schools of Mantine. ","It is unlikely for a trainer to see a wild Abomasnow in the wild, but it is more than possible for one to experience the howling blizzards they summon to cloak themselves. Abomasnow territory is bleak and barren, permanently shrouded in furious snowstorms. Only advanced trainers should attempt to scale the frozen peaks they dwell on. Snover are inquisitive, but harmless; they can unintentionally cause trouble when they cloak themselves in snow flurries, however.","It is unlikely for a trainer to see a wild Abomasnow in the wild, but it is more than possible for one to experience the howling blizzards they summon to cloak themselves.

There have been recorded incidents of Weavile packs going after weary mountain travelers. Strength in numbers is the best defense against Weavile; even the strongest lone fighter can be overwhelmed by an entire pack. These Pokémon dislike extended fights, and will flee if they cannot take down their target quickly enough.","Other than the standard warnings of electrocution that come with most Electric-type Pokémon, the primary source of concern regarding these Pokémon stems not from their danger to humans, but rather to electronic devices. They are known to siphon electrical energy from power lines and generators. Additionally, the magnetic fields they generate can cause devices to malfunction. The radio waves Magneton emit can dry the air and cause earaches in some people. ","Both Pokémon will lick foreign objects to learn about them, as they retain information based on tastes and textures. Lickitung saliva can cause numbing that will wear off in a few minutes, but Lickilicky saliva can cause numbing or even rashes that likely won’t go away without medical treatment; neither cause any serious side effects, however (except in the case of an allergic reaction). Lickilicky are known to constrict prey with their tongues, but almost never try this tactic on humans.","All members of this line are aggressive, but Rhyhorn are by far the most belligerent, charging on sight of unfamiliar objects. Their horns are sharp enough to pierce diamond; though trained racing Rhyhorn often have them dulled, their heavy weights still make them dangerous when angered. Rhydon and Rhyperior can also sweep foes with their heavy tails when angered, and can easily break bones with well-placed swings; luckily, they usually only attack when angered.","Obviously, the most pressing dangers these Pokémon possess are their copious vines. Trainers should stay wary in dense jungles, as these Pokémon often hide in bushes to snare passerby. Though Tangela are more annoying than threatening, they can still be dangerous if they happen to constrict the neck (though they more often go for the feet); Tangrowth are more hazardous, but will not hold on to large prey that struggle too much and will instead break off their vines.","All Pokémon in this line can deliver high-voltage shocks. Trainers should never stick their hands between an Elekid’s prongs, as an electric current will run through them whenever it charges. Electabuzz and Electivire are aggressive and will sometimes give chase if threatened. Touching an Electabuzz’s or Electivire’s horns or the latter’s twin tails is also not recommended. These Pokémon can also cause power outages if they drain too much electricity from a generator.","As Pokémon that can expel searing-hot flames, trainers should naturally be extremely careful around them. Luckily, they generally inhabit the craters of active volcanoes, where few trainers would be able to venture anyways. Additionally, they are not aggressive or even territorial. Despite this, travelers should give any stray individuals they come across a wide berth, as both Magmar and Magmortar can radiate significant heat even while standing still.","There have been no documented cases of these Pokémon harming or even attempting to harm humans. At most, the crying of young Togepi can be very irritating for those nearby, as the sound’s frequency is rather close to that of the crying of human children. In an unpleasant cycle, the annoyance of those around them makes Togepi cry even more. Overdosing on joy dust has been known to trigger effects similar to those achieved through consumption of MDMA.","Yanma can be a bit curious when it comes to humans, and are usually only aggressive towards other Yanma. They should not be trifled with, however, as they can create shock waves that can permanently damage hearing and shatter glass. Yanmega, on the other hand, are aggressive; their shock waves can break bones and their jaws can easily tear off limbs. These Pokémon are strong enough to carry away adult humans and should be treated with extreme caution.","Though not aggressive towards humans, each Eeveelution does bring along the expected hazards of their typing. A few do have some unexpected dangers, however. Both Jolteon and Umbreon can bristle their fur to make their hairs sharp enough to pierce the skin. Similarly, Leafeon are able to stiffen their leaves to make them surprisingly sharp. Umbreon will sweat poison from their pores when threatened. Finally, Sylveon’s feelers can be choking hazards for young children.","Though not aggressive towards humans, each Eeveelution does bring along the expected hazards of their typing.

Trainers should obviously be careful around their pincers and stingers. Wild Gligar are known to attack the faces of trainers passing nearby, so travelers should be wary when passing through their nesting areas. Gliscor are large enough to attack small Pokémon and trainers; they navigate by echolocation and can be disoriented with high-pitched whistles.","Swinub are not aggressive, but will charge recklessly towards the smell of food and can trip unwary travelers who happen to be carrying snacks. Piloswine act similarly, but are much heavier; they can cause significant injuries in a collision. They will also charge if they feel threatened or frightened by sounds they cannot locate the source of. Wild Mamoswine are rarely encountered by trainers; they are not aggressive, but will charge violently when angered or spooked.","Neither Porygon nor Porygon2 pose any particular threat to humans in the real world. Famously, there was an incident in which a Porygon in a computer caused the screen to flash violently, triggering seizures in the children watching it. The bug has never reoccured, though the event scared much of the public away from training Porygon. Porygon-Z can be uncontrollable when glitching and may attack recklessly while doing so.","Ralts will teleport away from those who they sense are aggressive; consequently, they are almost never seen by those who mean to cause it harm. Kirlia can distort space to create illusions, though it never does this to hurt others. Gardevoir and Gallade will lay down their lives to protect their trainers; Gallade will also challenge those who dishonor it to the death. It is difficult to truly anger either of these Pokémon, however, so dangerous situations almost never arise with them.","As one would expect, these Pokémon should be kept far away from anything metallic and valuable. They don’t actively seek to harm humans, but may attempt to draw in bicycles or even cars with magnetism fir their iron even as people are riding them. Compasses will malfunction when near these Pokémon; although they always point north, it can be extremely confusing when one is close enough to notice its effects on one’s compass without actually being able to see them.","Although Duskull and Dusclops strike fear in the hearts of travelers everywhere, they can easily be scared off with bright light. Duskull may surprise people and cause them to drop their flashlights, however; under no circumstances should one look them directly in their eyes. Dusknoir seem to have their own agendas, only pursuing those that they must. No one has ever been recorded escaping a hounding Dusknoir, who will follow their targets to the ends of the earth.","These Pokémon are rarely sighted by people, as they dwell in remote, icy areas that are unsuitable for humans. Snorunt are playful creatures that rarely mean any harm; they may approach mountain travelers due to curiosity. Glalie tend to ignore humans entirely, though people should stay away from them because of their freezing abilities. Froslass are rumored to freeze travelers and display their frozen victims in caverns, though no reports of this have been confirmed.","Wild Rotom are impish spirits that love to spook others. They can cause lights to flicker and machines to abruptly turn off or whirl to life, seemingly on their own. On devices with screens, they can project their grinning faces to scare people and Pokémon. However, they rarely mean to cause any actual harm; these Pokémon will quickly leave if they fail to successfully scare their attempted victims.","","","","","","","","","","Phione are not at all dangerous Pokémon, even in the large groups that they are often found in. They don’t seem capable of defending themselves from attackers; regardless, these Pokémon rarely ever appear to draw the ire of predators. For reasons unknown, wild Pokémon leave groups of floating Phione alone, and swimmers that come across them similarly report feeling a desire to let them be.","","","","","","These Pokémon are rare in the wild, and the few individuals that are encountered almost never bother to give people the time of day. They will actively ignore even travelers that directly approach them, literally turning up their heads at them. If attacked, however, they can unleash their energy in powerful attacks like Leaf Tornado. They also will become angered and lash out at those who dirty their pristine leaves.","These Pokémon are rare in the wild, and the few individuals that are encountered almost never bother to give people the time of day.

Their evolutions are not territorial, however; in fact, they are actually rather friendly even towards strangers. Emboar are very protective of their friends, however. They will stand in front of smaller Pokémon to defend them when they sense danger; trainers should back away if they see a wild Emboar assuming this stance.","Tepig are easily spooked; they will respond to threats by snorting out fire from their nostrils before fleeing.

Dewott, on the other hand, are initially not bothered by travelers, who they will let pass through their territory with no issues. They will quickly retaliate with their scalchops as soon as they are attacked, however.

Patrat are defensive in the face of danger; when one guard Patrat is spooked, it will alert the rest of its mob to hide underground, waiting for the threat to pass. Watchog, however, are more offensive. The first Watchog to spot an enemy will glow brightly, temporarily blinding it with a flash of light; its allies will quickly stuff seeds into their mouths to shoot at the attacker until it flees.","These Pokémon are very protective of their groups.

They have a innate instinct to be friendly towards people; Lillipup may approach travelers while yipping and wagging their tails, inviting them to play. They are protective of their own trainers and friends, however, and trained ones may display signs of aggression towards strangers that approach their loved ones; bared fangs and low-pitched growls are examples of such signs.","These Pokémon are not dangerous to humans, even in the wild.

These Pokémon will feign desperation to appeal to compassionate passerby only to steal their valuables when they try to help. Both Purrloin and Liepard also are equipped with sharp claws to slash foes with. Though Liepard will not bother attacking unless they are attacked first, Purrloin may scratch those standing in their way as they try to flee after a successful heist.","If one comes across a Purrloin that seems injured or hungry on the street, one should pay closer attention.

Pansage and Simisear are particularly benevolent, offering food to passing travelers. Simisage should not be approached, however; they can become aggressive with little notice even with no earlier signs of hostility.

While it takes a lot to anger Simisear and Simipour, both Pokémon will become upset if one damages the Berry trees and bushes they forage from.","These Pokémon are usually not dangerous towards humans. They stay away from conscious beings, hiding themselves in Dream Mist. Those that approach them and inhale the mist will quickly fall asleep, allowing these Pokémon to escape. According to popular folklore, people that wish to remember their dreams should hang nets over their windows or beds to keep Munna and Musharna away; oddly enough, this seems to be a relatively effective tactic.","These Pokémon are usually not dangerous towards humans.

Tranqill also dislike conflict and will try to stay away from others in general; they will lash out with their beaks and talons if harassed, however. Unfezant are the most aggressive of the line, especially during mating season. Males may attempt to strut in front of and peck other males, both travelers and Pokémon to “emasculate” them in front of potential mates.","Pidove are hardly dangerous, even in their large flocks; they will fly away when they sense danger rather than attacking.

Blitzle herds are easily spooked, but they usually will run away from danger rather than approach it; they can emit blinding flashes of light to blind attackers, but try to save their electricity for emergencies. Zebstrika will charge at a moment’s notice, triggering their herds to stampede with them; they shoot lightning bolts at random as they charge, further compounding the danger they pose with potential brushfires.","Trainers should not approach these Pokémon in the wild.

They will get very angry if one sticks objects into or otherwise messes with their ears, which house their energy cores.  Boldore will similarly scuttle away from confrontation, though they may charge at attackers with their bodies if they are cornered. Gigalith are usually peaceful, even when attacked, as their sturdy bodies will protect them from nearly anything. They can fire energy beams from their mouths to defend themselves, however. Both Boldore's and Gigalith's crystals will begin to glow prior to launching energy attacks.","Roggenrola are skittish creatures that will usually hear travelers approaching well before they can be seen, so they will quickly hide away before being spotted.

They rarely pose a significant threat to humans. Woobat may use their noses to mark people, but this action is painless and not a sign of aggression. Swoobat are also cordial to strangers, flitting about human spelunkers they come across. They are more than capable of defending themselves with ultrasonic waves if they feel threatened, however.","These Pokémon are very friendly, even towards foreign travelers.

Territorial Excadrill should not be bothered; they will attack those that enter their labyrinths. Both Drilbur and Excadrill can compromise the structural integrity of buildings when they burrow underneath them, especially when Excadrill dig intersecting tunnels under a foundation.","Drilbur are friendly Pokémon that sometimes help people grow crops, but they can also be a nuisance when the same crops they were tilling the soil for.

First and foremost, they are rarely even seen in the wild, as they can hear travelers approaching from far away and will hide long before they come near. Secondly, they will run from danger rather than face it, even when they are directly attacked. Finally, in the rare instances where they must defend themselves, they will almost immediately tend to the injuries they dealt to their attackers before fleeing.","Though these Pokémon are incredibly strong, they almost never attack humans. They can sometimes be spotted standing very close to suburban houses, but they usually are only observing the architecture. The materials that they carry around with them are very heavy, however; Gurdurr in particular do not always pay attention to where they swing their metal beams as they walk around, so people should give them a wide berth while they are working.","Though these Pokémon are incredibly strong, they almost never attack humans.

Tympole are easily scared and can deafen people when multiple of them vibrate in unison. Palpitoad and Seismitoad, in addition to their sonic capabilities, can also set off tremors through their vibrations. Seismitoad can also shoot a paralyzing toxin from the bumps on their heads to defend themselves; while not deadly, it can leave a person incapacitated for hours.","Though these Pokémon aren’t actively aggressive, trainers should still stay away from them.

Throh are actually more dangerous when they are far away, as they may accidentally hit travelers with the rocks and logs that they throw if they are too distant to see them. Sawk will become very angry at those that interrupt them while they are training, though even when upset they restrain themselves to only dealing blows strong enough to temporarily incapacitate their aggressors.","Neither of these Pokémon are usually aggressive.

Sewaddle actually don’t even seem to be able to detect aggression, as they will approach nearly anything with no regard to danger. Leavanny will defend their children with their lives, however, slashing at foes with their sharp cutters.

These puffs are irritating to the eyes and noses; since they have a tendency to clump together, they can also quickly make it difficult for enemies to move. Whimsicott are notoriously mischievous, sneaking into homes to cause trouble. Though their pranks can be very annoying, however, they almost never cause any lasting harm.

As soon as the sense hostility, however, they will try to bite offenders with their sharp teeth. Swimmers should note that paddling hands can attract these Pokémon when they mistake the movement for food. Schools of Red-Striped Basculin will attack blue objects on sight, as will Blue-Striped Basculin attack red objects; lakes will usually have signs noting which form swims within. ","Sandile are not aggressive Pokémon, but they are curious. They may nip at the bags of travelers to examine their contents. Krokorok are protective of their groups and will all come to the aid of one of their members if it is attacked. Krookodile are aggressive, but usually not towards humans.

It doesn’t take much to convince them to charge at a supposed threat. One should not touch or disturb a Darmanitan in Zen Mode; doing so could cause it to revert to its Standard Form, ready to attack.","Darumaka are very friendly towards humans.

In fact, they have sometimes been recorded to rhythmically shake their bodies in time with the singing or humming of travelers. These Pokémon will defend themselves with their spikes if threatened, however; they will smack nearby aggressors with Needle Arm or shoot at those farther away with Pin Missile.","Neither of these Pokémon are aggressive towards humans. When endangered, they will tuck themselves into their shells and hide. If their shells are shattered, they will quickly flee to safety. Crustle can sometimes be roadblocks when they try to cross busy streets; the rumbling and sounds of approaching cars will spook a Crustle into hiding, leaving a large, dense block of stone in the middle of the road.","Neither of these Pokémon are aggressive towards humans.

They dutifully patrol areas where walls or entryways may have once stood, attacking those that try to pass by them. They will destroy anything standing in their way as they fly back and forth. Trainers should note that these Pokémon will always fly along the same pathway at a set speed; with careful timing, one can sneak past these Pokémon without drawing their attention.","Yamask are not an aggressive species, but their cries can be vey unsettling because of how much they resemble human voices. It is said that some archaeologists have been driven insane by the sound of many Yamask trying to “converse” with them all at once. Cofagrigus are usually stationary ambush predators; travelers should watch out for suspicious gold coffins. They can crawl surprisingly fast, however, even clinging to walls and ceilings to chase down those that bother them.","Yamask are not an aggressive species, but their cries can be vey unsettling because of how much they resemble human voices.

Regardless, research shows that Tirtouga are not initially hostile, but they are very easily provoked; they are surprisingly fast in the water but extremely slow on land. Carracosta are not aggressive, as their shells protect them from most harm. They will use their powerful flippers to smash into foes that continue to pester them, though.","As these Pokémon have gone extinct a hundred thousand years ago, it is very unlikely that trainers will encounter them in the wild.

Archeops have great difficulty controlling their flight, so they may accidentally crash into others in the air or as they land.

They are not aggressive, but can attack with poisonous concoctions unique to them; since the composition of such mixtures depends on the exact refuse they had eaten, treating these attacks can be difficult.

Their primary method of defense at all stages of evolution is the emission of icy mist. This mist cloaks them and allows them to flee; additionally, it is so cold that it can encase attackers in ice if they spend too much time engulfed in it.

They will defend their nests and the stored food within them, shocking those that get too close. Strong winds such as those created by the attacks of some Flying-types will prevent these creatures from taking flight.","Karrablast prefer to hide from danger. Because they often seek shelter in the tall grass, however, trainers may accidentally encounter them while traveling. When startled, they will spit a mildly-corrosive acid that can cause mild irritation on the skin; one should seek medical attention if it reaches the eyes, however. Escavalier should not be bothered; though not initially aggressive, they see approaching people as challengers and will charge at them with little hesitation.","Karrablast prefer to hide from danger.

This is especially true when they are sunbathing, as they are unable to see where they are floating while in this position.","Joltik can be a nuisance in cities where they can cause small blackouts as they feed. They can also be a bother to trainers with Electric-type Pokémon, as they can attach unnoticed before they begin draining their hosts of electricity; they will also shock those that try to remove them. Galvantula are not aggressive, but their sticky webs can be dangerous as they adhere to skin and deliver stunning electric shocks.

Still, trainers should avoid these Pokémon if spotted, as they can be aggressive and will use their icy chains to bind potential prey or threats. A heat source, such as a flame or hand warmer, will keep wild Cryogonal far away.","Shelmet dislike being bothered; if threatened, they will spit a sticky poison, clamp shut, and then burrow deeper into the mud. This poison is difficult to wash off and can cause mild to moderate irritation if left on the skin. Accelgor are blindingly fast and thus rarely have to come into conflict with others.

Additionally, since they mostly hide beneath a thin layer of mud, they can be difficult to spot even if trainers are alert.

These Pokémon are especially weak to the cold, as they will freeze up and become unable to move if their body temperatures drop too low. Thus, Ice-type attacks are especially effective against these creatures.","Though they are not not aggressive, trainers should avoid approaching these Pokémon in the wild. They seem to stand guard over the ruins that they dwell in, attacking intruders that try to explore them. Golurk are especially formidable foes, as they can fly at Mach speeds to catch up to and dispatch fleeing invaders. Under no circumstances should a trainer try to destroy or remove a Golurk’s seal; doing so could result in disastrous consequences for both the trainer and his or her surroundings.","Though they are not not aggressive, trainers should avoid approaching these Pokémon in the wild.

To clarify, this means that Bouffalant will each decide to charge at a foe if they see one rather than members of a herd charging when they see others doing so. Trainers can use this to their advantage by quickly hiding if they are spotted; only a few Bouffalant will charge as their herds continue traveling. They will then quickly give up chase so they aren’t left behind.","Although these Pokémon are not aggressive towards humans, they are valiant fighters that will quickly retaliate if threatened.

If not bothered, they will prefer to forage for Durant and ignore travelers entirely. They will use their flames to burn those that disturb them while they are trying to feed, however. Before a Heatmor attacks, it will begin to spew sooty smoke from its tail. They will not chase down foes that back away from this warning sign, as they would much prefer to continue eating.","Durant are a very aggressive species. Colonies will work together to defend their queens, attacking any other species (and even Durant of other colonies) that encroach on their territories. Their strong jaws can leave very nasty wounds, especially since they aim for vulnerable areas and team up to bite the same victim. Although flames scare these Pokémon, travelers should note that they also trigger their defense response; Durant will immediately prepare for attack if they see fire.","All stages of the Deino line are extremely aggressive in the wild.

However, they are a bit warier of strangers than their pre-evolutions and will use their speed to quickly flee from danger.","Since these Pokémon have long been extinct in the wild, trainers should (luckily) only ever encounter them under the command of other trainers. Even trained Tyrunt should not be approached; they are notoriously disobedient and tend to bite strangers. Fearsome Tyrantrum would be a very grave danger if wild, but usually do not pose much of an issue when trained. It may be comforting to know that a panicked human can run faster than a chasing Tyrantrum.","Since these Pokémon have long been extinct in the wild, trainers should (luckily) only ever encounter them under the command of other trainers.

Even so, they are gentle giants that rarely come into conflict with others. They will protect themselves with blocks of ice when threatened. Aurorus may also try to entrap foes in ice to immobilize them, but they will only do this if their attackers persist in trying to harm them.","Trainers will likely never encounter these extinct Pokémon in the wild, especially since they would only even be found in the coldest, most bitter reaches of tundras and glaciers.

A few do have some unexpected dangers, however. Both Jolteon and Umbreon can bristle their fur to make their hairs sharp enough to pierce the skin. Similarly, Leafeon are able to stiffen their leaves to make them surprisingly sharp. Umbreon will sweat poison from their pores when threatened. Finally, Sylveon’s feelers can be choking hazards for young children.","Hawlucha usually do not attack humans in the wild. They normally stay in the treetops as travelers pass below, as they have no interest in dueling people in battle. There is an exception to this, however; Hawlucha will attack those wearing brightly-colored masks or hoods, as they associate such patterns with opposing Hawlucha. Trainers should be sure to not wear headgear, or at least wear drably-colored pieces, when traveling through their territories.","Dedenne are rarely a significant threat to humans, as their defensive shocks are usually only mildly stunning. They are more of an annoyance than a danger, as families of them living within homes can greatly increase electrical costs for homeowners. Their communication can also interfere with radio waves. Special radio-emitting devices can be used to drive Dedenne away from homes, though they should be used periodically to ensure that they do not return.","These Pokémon are not known to be a threat to humans. Carbink almost never attack enemies in the wild; instead, they simply let their sturdy bodies weather blows and ignore their attackers completely. In the rare case that they do retaliate, they will simply fire beams from the jewels on their heads before fleeing. Carbink are said to be very protective of Diancie, however; it is thought that they will valiantly defend this mythical Pokémon with their lives.","Goomy are not much of a danger to people. They hide away from danger in the wild because they are not well-equipped to defend themselves in direct combat. Sliggoo also dislike fighting, but they are able to excrete coagulated digestive fluids onto opponents that attack them; gloves are recommended when handling anxious individuals. Goodra are friendly Pokémon that rarely get angry, but they can use their elastic horns to strike enemies with powerful punches if threatened.","Goomy are not much of a danger to people.

They will infamously steal any keys that they find lying around, and they will even take those that they find in unlocked homes. If threatened, Klefki will initially jingle their keys angrily to deter foes, usually to no effect. Continued aggression will force them to utilize status moves to keep them away. The only way to recover stolen keys from a wild Klefki is to defeat it in battle, causing it to drop its stash (much to its despair).","Although many pieces of folklore warn about how Phantump and Trevenant intentionally try and lure travelers into their woods to trap them, there is not much evidence to support this claim. Trevenant may be very protective of their forests, but they will not attack those passing through unless they try to harm the trees. When endangered, Phantump will cry and flee to alert Trevenant, setting entire forests against the transgressors.  ","Although many pieces of folklore warn about how Phantump and Trevenant intentionally try and lure travelers into their woods to trap them, there is not much evidence to support this claim.

Pumpkaboo can sometimes be seen converging at certain locations during the night; it is best to not disturb them during this time, as they seem to be more anxious and prone to attacking. Gourgeist can paralyze enemies in fear with their disturbing singing and entangle them with their arms. They can be aggressive when approached and thus should be left alone.","Although many people fear these creatures, there is not much evidence to support their superstitious beliefs.

Avalugg are ambivalent towards humans, who are much smaller than them and rarely pose a threat. They will fiercely defend their young, however, by trying to crush those that endanger them under their heavy bodies. Avalugg floating in water can also be a danger to ships trying to navigate polar seas.","Trainers will rarely come across these Pokémon in the wild, as they live in frigid areas where few ever travel.

Noivern are aggressive and can be very dangerous in dark, winding caves. They can be easily calmed with fruit, however, so spelunkers should be sure to bring along a few Persim Berries just in case.","Headphones are very strongly advised when raising Noibat or simply traveling through their territories; a lone Noibat can cause minor headaches, nausea, or dizziness with its sound waves, while a whole roost of them can easily incapacitate a person.

Even so, these Pokémon are nocturnal and prefer to avoid humans, making dangerous encounters rare. All members of this line can easily defend themselves with their precise aim and sharp feathers, however; they can dispatch threats from considerable distance. Dartrix, even trained ones, can be dangerous when their nerves are triggered.

Litten prefer to stay away from others, but even young ones can defend themselves with ignited fireballs. Torracat will emit a ringing sound from their flame sacs before attacking, giving foes a chance to flee. Incineroar can be dangerous to be around, even when trained, as they may attack recklessly when in heated battles.

They primarily defend themselves with explosive bubbles. Primarina will also use their singing in battle as a form of attack (such as in the move Sparkling Aria).

They are fiercely protective of their caches and nests, however, with barrages of seeds; trainers should stay away from trees with many holes bored into them, as these are almost certainly Pikipek stashes. Toucannon can fire powerful blasts and should not be trifled with; they will leave alone those who leave them alone.

Their sharp teeth can leave deep wounds, and these Pokémon are one of the most common sources of injury for starting Alolan trainers. Luckily, Yungoos do not stray from their patrol paths, so it is easy to watch one and take care to avoid it. Gumshoos focus on their current prey with all of their concentration; it is very difficult to provoke one into attacking.","Trainers should not approach Yungoos in the wild.

Tall people particularly have problems with these Pokémon, as they have a habit of climbing atop their heads and not moving. The only way to get a Crabrawler to move without getting punched is to provide it somewhere taller to climb onto. Crabominable are almost never seen in the wild because of their severe habitats.

When their meadows are approached, they will circle in the sky above to prepare for attack. Stepping on or picking their flowers will prompt them to dive in and use Revelation Dance. They will rarely ever attack travelers unless their blooms are directly endangered, however. Baile Style Oricorio are said to be the most aggressive, while Pa’u Style Oricorio are said to be the least.","Cutiefly are practically harmless creatures; they rely on their small size and nimble flight to keep away from danger. Swarms of them may cluster around the heads of those feeling strong emotions, which can be a great annoyance (especially if one was already upset). Ribombee are usually friendly and may offer Pollen Puffs to amiable travelers. They can also defend themselves with harmful Puffs, however; one should never eat a Pollen Puff without knowing what is inside.","Cutiefly are practically harmless creatures; they rely on their small size and nimble flight to keep away from danger.

Midday Form ones will use their speed to escape from danger, while Midnight Form ones will not attack unless struck first.

If one sees a Solo Form Wishiwashi’s eyes begin to water, it is time to swim away. The best way to avoid a school of Wishiwashi is to simply hide; their size makes it hard for them to reach small areas, and they must eventually disperse and separate.","Even new swimmers will instinctively know to avoid these horned Pokémon. In addition to their sharp spikes, both evolutions are poisonous as well; they can fire their spikes from afar to defend themselves. Luckily, they will only attack divers that get too close or interfere with their Corsola horns. Accidental contact is somewhat common, however, since it can be hard to spot these Pokémon in vibrant reefs. Still, their poison is not fatal, and most effects subside in three days.","Even new swimmers will instinctively know to avoid these horned Pokémon.

Mudbray can kick an adult human a sizable distance away, while Mudsdale can crush metal with their stomps, however. Given these facts, it goes without saying that travelers should avoid provoking these usually-mild Pokémon, especially by keeping them away from their mud.","These Pokémon defend themselves with their powerful hooves.

Luckily, they prefer to conserve energy and avoid attacking, so they only pose a huge threat if purposefully cornered. Lurantis are more territorial, but they are also ambush predators that observe intruders before striking.

Lone Salandit are meek, but they will fight without regard for their own safety in defense of their Salazzle.

They seclude themselves high in the canopies in forests so that they will only be found by those that intentionally seek to find them. Jungle travelers may search for Oranguru when they need medicine or healing, but they should know that Oranguru will turn down those that disrespect it or the other Pokémon of the forest.","It is very unwise to anger these Pokémon in the wild. Their unparalleled teamwork allows them to take down foes much stronger than any one of them alone. When one of their teammates is in danger, they will stop at nothing to keep them safe. Luckily Passimian rarely attack without reason. They usually will keep to themselves as they train or gather Berries. Travelers should not pick Berries in their general vicinities, however, as these Pokémon will see this as a challenge.","Neither of these Pokémon pose much of a threat to travelers. Both species will flee when they sense people approaching. They will only defend themselves if cornered, and even so, only for long enough to buy time for an escape. Wimpod can spew poisonous fluids while Golisopod can slash with their powerful claws. Since both evolutions will flee before attacking, however, simply backing away will give them enough space to avoid conflict.","Neither of these Pokémon pose much of a threat to travelers.

Sandygast cannot do much unless their shovels are grabbed; even when they are, they usually only command others to build them up instead of actually harming them. Palossand are much more dangerous because of their sandy vortexes. These creatures are luckily rather immobile, so steering clear of odd shovels should be enough to avoid danger. In Sandygast habitats, knock down piles of sand before leaving beaches to protect future visitors from potential incidents.","As a rule of thumb, never approach errant shovels on the beach, for they may in fact be these Pokémon in hiding.

It can be easy to step on these Pokémon when they are partially buried in the sand, and doing so will make them retaliate with resounding punches using their innards. If one chooses to throw them back into the sea, one must be careful of touching their mouths or spikes; brushing either will cause them to strike.","A researcher that abandoned the Beast Killer Project before its termination recalled that the Type: Null began attacking the scientists outfitting them with the RKS Systems while writhing in pain; she stated the event was why she left the position. There are no Type: Null or Silvally currently outside the ownership or care of specific trainers and organizations.","A researcher that abandoned the Beast Killer Project before its termination recalled that the Type: Null began attacking the scientists outfitting them with the RKS Systems while writhing in pain; she stated the event was why she left the position.

The largest danger Minior pose to travelers actually occurs with the latter, as crashing Minior can cause significant damage if they make a direct hit. Even close calls can leave minor injuries from shrapnel. “Minior showers” occur when groups of Minior pass through large dust clouds and subsequently fall in unison; such events, though rare, are very dangerous.","Komala are rarely a danger to trainers, as they usually keep to themselves high up in the treetops. They are irked by continued loud noises, however, and have been known to blindly knock down branches onto raucous groups of travelers as if to silence them. Thrashing Komala can only strike in the general direction of danger; they may accidentally hit others nearby as they flail. Those that let sleeping Komala lie will almost never be bothered, however.","Never approach Turtonator in the wild. They are ambush predators that will almost never attack without being provoked. Their volatile shells can create explosions that can knock people off their feet even from a distance, however. Trainers must be wary when crossing volcanic ranges, as these Pokémon can be easy to miss in smoky areas (especially when travelers are too occupied to look down). Never attack these Pokémon from up close; pressure can easily trigger explosions.","Togedemaru are not aggressive. When provoked, they will first curl up into balls with their spikes raised to deter attackers. If this fails, they will electrocute enemies with electricity. Touching their spikes or lightning rods can deliver small shocks. In areas where these Pokémon are found, trainers should steer clear of open clearings where they gather, as lightning will inevitably strike where many of them are present.","Mimikyu love human affection and almost never attack those that give them attention. Trainers should never touch wild Mimikyu, however, as they are very protective of their costumes and will lash out with their shadowy arms to keep them intact. One should never lift a Mimikyu’s cloth; not only will this provoke them into attacking, but it may also reveal their true bodies; it is said this sight can cause great sickness to befall upon onlookers.","Despite their fearsome jaws, Bruxish are rarely a threat to humans. They do not bite unless they are significantly provoked; even when their protuberances are stepped on, they usually remain buried in the sand. Their grinding teeth can induce headaches over time, but since they can only be heard while underwater, most swimmers are not in range long enough for this to occur. Those that intentionally disturb Bruxish will likely be bitten with their fearsome teeth, however.","Most of the time, Drampa are very peaceful and friendly Pokémon that pose no danger to humans. They are comfortable being touched and even ridden, especially around kids. They will enrage and go berserk when children near them are imperiled, however; in such states, they cannot be reasoned with, and they will attack blindly until they see to it that the children are safe. Young ones should be evacuated from the area until Drampa calm down.","Divers should not approach Dhelmise. Though they are not actively aggressive, the sheer weight of their anchors can make even nonchalant swings very dangerous. Drawing too close to them may also cause them to attack in self-defense. Sailors warn that these Pokémon sometimes attack ships, presumably for parts; there have been no confirmed cases of Dhelmise intentionally going after human vessels, however.","Because Jangmo-o live so far from humans, most people rarely encounter them. They are protective of their groups and will stand together when a member is threatened. Adventurous Hakamo-o may come across travelers as they search for opponents; they will try to initiate fights, but will walk away if their foes appear unwilling. Kommo-o do not bother with those who back away when they approach. Those who remain unmoving in their paths, though, should prepare for battle.","Because Jangmo-o live so far from humans, most people rarely encounter them.

All evolutions are fiercely protective of their troops and will swiftly come to the defense of other members in the face of danger. Rillaboom welcome an audience to their performances, but it is taboo to try to harm or catch any of the other wild Pokémon attending; trainers that attempt this may find the entire forest, RIillaboom included, turning on them at once.","These Pokémon are not aggressive, though they can be quite curious when it comes to human travelers--Grookey and Thwackey especially so.

Their speed allows them to flee from potential danger well before it approaches, so antagonistic encounters with humans are rare. If cornered, Scorbunny can deliver burning kicks using the soles of their feet, while Raboot and Cinderace can launch flaming pebbles to burn and bruise attackers. Interrupting a practicing Raboot or Cinderace is a good way to anger them and provoke them into attacking.","These Pokémon tend to be rare in the wild.

Sobble can cry tears that will make all those around them cry as well, though they will flee immediately afterwards. Drizzile are the most likely to cause trainers trouble, setting traps that are well-hidden enough to fool humans and throwing balloons of water at those who disturb them. Sharp-eyed Inteleon can shoot blasts of water from afar, and trainers will know if they are trespassing one's territory after a well-aimed warning shot just in front of their eyes.","These Pokémon are excellent at stealth, and as such it is unlikely that traveling trainers will run into them by accident.

This also goes for trainers picking from wild Berry trees; one should keep an eye out for rustling in the canopy before approaching a Berry tree. Skwovet and Greedent are also attracted to Berries trainers and Pokémon are carrying around, and may chew through the backpacks of camping travelers to get at them. Their senses of smell are not particularly great, so they rely mostly on sight to identify Berry stashes.

In areas where these Pokémon dwell, it is imperative to keep one's belongings locked up tight. They can sneak into unzipped tents in the dead of night without waking the occupants, so simply keeping things near one's person is not sufficient. If a Pokémon with a good sense of smell begins to act unusual, keep an eye out; a Thievul may be marking easy targets with its scent somewhere nearby.","The main danger these Pokémon pose is through their discreet thievery rather than direct conflict.

They prefer to float away from trouble rather than fight it. As they float together on breezes, however, they do tend to be present in large numbers. Gossifleur pollen and Eldegoss cotton both can trigger allergic reactions in those who are susceptible. When they swarm, these reactions can be quite intense; even people and Pokémon who normally experience no effects may end up with runny noses and teary eyes during their peak season.

Though it may be tempting to pet a Yamper sprinting nearby, doing so can result in an unpleasant shock. Boltund packs are protective of one another and will attack if they believe a pack member is threatened.

In the wild, trainers can check the water for their presence by waving a stick or branch beneath the surface for a few minutes; the movement should attract any Arrokuda and Barraskewda that are nearby.

If consumed, Sinistea will taste quite disgusting and will consume a bit of life force from the drinker, but luckily it does not require much. Wild Polteageist prefer to not be imbibed at all and will not actively try to get humans to drink them, but they will launch their tea to defend themselves if picked up.

Zigzagoon will flee or play dead when scared, and are considered more of a pest than a danger in urban areas because they often knock over trash cans while rummaging through them. Linoone also prefer to flee from danger with their great speed. If cornered, though, they may attack by headbutting the aggressor before dashing away. Because they can only run straight, however, they are relatively easy to dodge.","Meowth and Persian both have sharp claws, though they are withdrawn if the Pokémon aren’t feeling threatened. Meowth will steal shiny objects like jewelry and watches from strangers they pass on the street; they will stash these items in hoards somewhere near where they sleep. Trainers should familiarize themselves with the locations of their Meowth’s hoards should a valuable item ever go missing. Persian are known to lash out at their trainers when they displease them.","Corsola are not dangerous Pokémon; tourists in tropical regions will often go snorkeling or scuba diving in Corsola reefs with no problems. They aren’t aggressive and prefer to use their hard bodies to shrug off attacks rather than fight back. However, cornered Corsola may launch off their branches using Spike Cannon if left with no other option. Entire colonies will work together to ward off intruders, so tormenting a seemingly-harmless individual in a reef is very ill-advised.","Farfetch’d are rather harmless Pokémon--unfortunately, this was a large reason why they were so easy to hunt and are so endangered today. Still, they are very skilled at defending themselves with their leeks, and seem uncannily perceptive when seeking out the weak spots of opponents. Though normally noble and honorable opponents, Farfetch’d will not hesitate to strike with “cheap shots” if their leeks are in danger.","Living alongside humans, neither Mime Jr. nor Mr. Mime pose much of a threat to people. Mime Jr. are known to target people they sense are benevolent when performing for food, a skill that makes them popular among beggars. Mr. Mime will become angry if their performances are interrupted, slapping offenders with their huge hands. Their invisible walls can also be nuisances in crowded streets, though most Mr. Mime know that blocking traffic won’t help them earn food.","Yamask are not an aggressive species, but their cries can be vey unsettling because of how much they resemble human voices. It is said that some archaeologists have been driven insane by the sound of many Yamask trying to “converse” with them all at once. Cofagrigus are usually stationary ambush predators; travelers should watch out for suspicious gold coffins. They can crawl surprisingly fast, however, even clinging to walls and ceilings to chase down those that bother them.","These Pokémon are not dangerous, as cream is their main method of defense. At worst, trainers may get a glob of (delicious) whipped cream thrown into their faces, which may obscure their vision for a bit. There have been reports of a few Alcremie in polluted urban areas, however, that have infused their cream with absolutely putrid industrial runoff. In the off chance that one runs into one of these Alcremie (as well as for common decency's sake), one should not needlessly antagonize these Pokémon in the wild.

These creatures will not hunt anything larger than themselves, but they are militant in defending themselves and are quick to react to perceived danger. Approaching a Falinks may trigger its fighting instinct; if one sees it quickly shift formation with the brass in front, it is preparing to launch an offensive. Backing away from Falinks as they prepare to attack is usually sufficient to get them to relent.","","Snom are mostly helpless against attackers; their frosty silk can cause frostbite if it adheres to skin for an extended period of time, but trainers in icy areas are usually fully-clothed. Endangering a Snom can attract the ire of a Frosmoth, however, who are considerably more dangerous. Frosmoth can whip up blizzards with their icy wings to punish those that cause harm to their domains.

Bothering a sun-gazing Stonjourner is a poor idea, however, as these Pokémon can deliver powerful kicks. A recent trend involving climbing upon wild Stonjourner for photo opportunities is also very ill-advised; a number of trainers have already been hospitalized for this foolhardy endeavor.","Eiscue are not very dangerous to humans. If confronted, they prefer to flee rather than fight and risk shattering their ice blocks. If cornered, they may attempt to defend themselves with Ice-type attacks, but simply presenting an opening to run is usually enough to get them to flee. Touching an Eiscue's hair will likely be an unpleasant experience for both parties; Eiscue hairs are very sensitive and also radiate a biting cold that can cause frostbite if held anything more than a brief few seconds.","Indeedee are not dangerous Pokémon; they would prefer to help humans in exchange for thankfulness rather than antagonize them unnecessarily. However, they can attack with psychic energy if threatened. Treating an urban Indeedee badly is also a supremely poor idea. These Pokémon can quickly relay messages by touching horns, and travelers that are identified as poor customers by one Indeedee can quickly find themselves being denied services all over the city.","Full Belly Mode Morpeko pose almost no threat to humans; they are friendly and prefer to flee from rather than fight danger. These Pokémon never remain in this mode for long, however. Hangry Mode Morpeko are terrors at a level that can be difficult to describe if not experienced. They will use their surprising speed to launch themselves at anything nearby, biting viciously with their sharp teeth at vulnerable areas. They can be quite destructive in short amounts of time. To calm them down, trainers should not offer food to such Morpeko from up close, but instead toss it from afar (preferably from behind the cover of a tree or large boulder).","In the wild, Cufant and Copperajah are normally docile creatures that are aloof to passing travelers. They are quite protective of their herds and their young, however, and will put up a fierce fight if they sense a threat to either. Copperajah are formidable foes that should not be trifled with; if one angers a Copperajah, it is best to back away slowly to prevent it and its herd from attacking. \"Lonely\" Cufant are in fact rarely far from their mothers, and should be given a wide berth to account for this.","In the wild, Cufant and Copperajah are normally docile creatures that are aloof to passing travelers.

Dracozolt and Arctozolt can generate electricity, while Dracovish and Arctovish have powerful jaws; Dracozolt and Dracovish can deliver strong kicks, while Arctozolt and Arctovish can freeze foes solid. Again, however, it is incredibly unlikely that trainers will be in a situation where they must defend themselves against these creatures.","Trainers will never encounter these Pokémon in the wild.

They are deceptively fast Pokémon that can easily catch up to fleeing travelers. Water is one's best defense against an angry Duraludon; they would rather back down from a fight rather than risk developing rust. As any competent traveler should be carrying drinking water at the very least, quick-thinking trainers should be able to ward off approaching Duraludon fairly efficiently.","These Pokémon are rarely sighted and even more rarely become involved with humans. Both Drakloak and Dragapult can detect and evade travelers long before they themselves are noticed. The only situation in which trainers may run into trouble with these Pokémon is in the event that they frighten a lone Dreepy. This will trigger the strong caretaking instincts of nearby Drakloak and Dragapult; in this case, trainers should take cover behind a sturdy rock to avoid being blasted by a Dreepy projectile and wait for the attacking Pokémon to glide away.","These Pokémon are rarely sighted and even more rarely become involved with humans.

["Most trainers are familiar with temperate, broadleaf forests. With mild, but seasonal weather and healthy tree growth, they play home to many common Pokémon. Many types can be found in these forests, but Grass-, Bug-, Flying-, and Normal-types are the most abundant. Novice trainers would do well starting their adventures in such areas.","Tropical jungles are warm and humid year-round with very frequent rainfall. They are densely vegetated with tall trees, vines, and other plants. A thick canopy of leaves shades over a dark understory in these rainforests. Grass- and Bug-types thrive in these prolific habitats, which have more Pokémon and plant life per square meter than any other terrestrial biome.","Woodlands are a bit less dense than forests, allowing them to support more shrubs and bushes. They often form in areas where a few trees have fallen, allowing flowers and tall grasses to take advantage of open sunlight.  Damp, rotting logs and plentiful shade from remaining trees make woodlands ideal for Bug-types; when night falls, Dark-types, Ghost-types, and Fairy-types may also appear in these whimsical habitats.","Open fields and meadows are turfed with lush, short grass and wildflowers. A near-total lack of trees grants these areas with gentle breezes, open skies, and warm sunlight. With temperate weather and moderate rainfall, many Normal- and Flying-types can be found in these habitats. Oddly, Electric-types often dwell here as well, perhaps so they can be unobstructed by trees during lightning storms.","All of these habitats are characterized by a lack of tall trees and an abundance of tall grass. They are warm with seasonal rainfall; dry seasons are exceptionally devoid of water. Brushfires are an occasional occurrence in these areas, a phenomenon exacerbated by Fire- and Electric-types that can start them. Poison- and Normal-types are also a regular sight in the tall grass.","Urban areas like cities are defined by the humans that live in them and the environments that they create. Some Pokémon only can live parts of their lives in cities, while others happily inhabit walkways, alleys, or even homes as pets--or pests. Normal-, Psychic-, Fighting-, and Ghost-type Pokémon often coexist alongside people, while Poison-types even thrive on the waste that we create.","As one would expect, Electric-types love to congregate around areas with high levels of electrical activity. One would most readily think of human structures like power plants, but these Pokémon are also attracted to naturally-occurring magnetic hot spots and lightning rods.","For most of their altitude, volcanoes are much like mountains in terms of the wildlife that they support. Close to the craters of active ones though, or near magma pools inside of them, only Pokémon that can withstand the blistering heat can survive. Naturally, this means Fire-types thrive in these areas, though sturdier Rock-types and the occasional Poison-type can be found here as well.","Little to no light penetrates into dark, damp caverns. Mineral-rich Ground-, Rock-, and Steel-types can often be found underground alongside a variety of Pokémon adapted to life in the dark. Some Dragon-types also have a preference to hide themselves deep within winding caves.","This biome specifically refers to the open-faced, rugged mountainsides ideal for Rock- and Steel-types; mountain forests and peaks usually support a different set of Pokémon entirely. These places are also remote and usually quiet, so Fighting-types often find refuge on them so they can train in peace.","Sandy, arid deserts support many Ground-type Pokémon that can burrow away from the sun's heat. Many other hardy species of Pokémon, however, have also adapted to a life of sweltering days and frigid nights. Desert dwellers also usually require very little water for survival or have some way of storing it for long periods of time.","Not many Pokémon can eke out a living in the badlands. Harsh weather, barren and rocky soil, and few trees for shelter make these areas tough to survive in. Though many types are represented, few are particularly abundant; resilient Steel- and Ground-types stand out from the rest, though Dark-, Dragon-, and even Flying-types appear as well. In such wastelands, only the scrappiest Pokémon can truly survive.","Ponds are small, freshwater bodies of water characterized by their stagnation; water doesn't flow in or out of them, making them prime spots for rich algal growth. Pond Pokémon can usually tolerate murky waters; they are usually slower and smaller than those found in lakes, finding refuge in calmer, smaller pools of water. While Water-types are of course most abundant here, Bug-types also often can be seen flitting around ponds.","Lakes are large bodies of fresh water; they aren't flowing like rivers or streams, but also aren't small and murky like ponds. This makes them ideal for larger Pokémon that aren't equipped to handle swift currents. Naturally, Water-types are most common in lakes, as they are in all bodies of water.","Swiftly-flowing freshwater streams and rivers naturally are home to a number of different Water-type Pokémon, many of whom also inhabit lakes (and often swim in and out of them through rivers). Species that manage to dwell in these areas are usually adapted to either swim against or endure currents so they aren't swept away. ","Pokémon that dwell near lakes and rivers are usually--but not always--decent swimmers that could jump right in if they wanted. Most species in riparian habitats are also Water-types, but again, there are exceptions. Access to fresh water means that these areas often support vibrant plant life alongside their banks.","Rocky and sandy beaches play home to many semiaquatic Pokémon that are content only spending some of their time in the sea. The intertidal zone also supports rock pools where some hardier Water-types make their homes; Pokémon that dwell here are adapted to withstand crashing waves and changing tides.","The vast, open ocean supports many types of marine Water-types. Some float near the surface of the sea in sunlit waters, while others dive deeper below into the pelagic zone. Still others spend their lives resting on the sea floor and the continental shelf. This habitat refers primarily to cold or temperate waters, excluding deep abysses, icy seas, and tropical reefs.","Warm, sunlit waters and vibrant coral reefs provide the Water-types that dwell here with abundant food and shelter, making them the richest ecosystems in the world. Marine Pokémon of all kinds can be found in these tropical havens, which are particularly sensitive to changes in water temperature, salinity, and cleanliness.","The polar seas are a frigid habitat often filled with ice floes and icebergs. Parts of these areas routinely freeze over entirely, locking vast expanses of ocean water beneath them. The Ice- and Water-types that dwell in these chilly seas are adapted to withstand subzero temperatures and survive even as the waters freeze around them.","Little is known about the deepest trenches of the sea floor, where the water is frigid, the pressure is crushing, and the seascape is engulfed in darkness. The life down in these abysses is often unusual and alien; these Water-types have adapted to an environment unlike any other in the world. ","While they may seem unappealing and dreary on the surface, wetlands are some of the richest terrestrial habitats we know of. These environments play home to many Grass-, Bug-, Water-, and Poison-types who have devised ways to take advantage of the acidic, oxygen-poor soils that characterize such places.","This section includes the most frozen reaches of the worlds: icy glaciers, snowy mountain peaks, and frozen caverns. These areas are permanently trapped in plant-unfriendly ice, so the life that survives here--primarily Ice-types, of course--has adapted to withstand freezing temperatures and scarce food supplies.","The tundra is characterized by a layer of permafrost that makes it difficult for anything more than grasses, mosses, and lichens to grow. Meanwhile, boreal forests are filled with evergreen, coniferous trees and are sometimes blanketed in snow. These areas have seasons of total darkness where the sun never rises, but also fleeting periods where it never sets. Ice-types are the most common in these frigid areas, but heartier Normal-types sometimes dwell here as well.","Ruins and cemeteries are an odd habitat; they are associated with humans, but they are remnants of past activity rather than current events. The Pokémon that dwell here are often associated with the supernatural, as if they can detect something about their surroundings that science and humanity cannot."]
