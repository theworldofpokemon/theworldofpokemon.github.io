"1","Bulbasaur","001","Kanto forests and jungles","When Bulbasaur are born, their mothers plant seeds on their backs. The plants form symbiotic relationships with their hosts, growing alongside the Pokémon and providing them with sustenance. By lying about in the sun, Bulbasaur allow the plants on their backs to photosynthesize and produce energy, which they can then use for themselves. The plants are able to become mobile by virtue of their active hosts, allowing them to move out of shaded areas and thus benefiting them as well. Additionally, Bulbasaur can utilize their plants to perform Grass- and Poison-type attacks such as Razor Leaf and Poison Powder. The attacks protect both the Pokémon and the plants from harm. In the wild, Bulbasaur tend to be very rare, as they are shy creatures that prefer the company of their own kind. However, they are also generally very docile, tame, and loyal to people that they trust, and for that reason are one of the species of Pokémon available for starting trainers to choose in the region of Kanto.","﻿Evolves into Ivysaur at Lvl 16Ivysaur evolves into Venusaur at Lvl 32","Grass/Poison"," 2'04\" | 0.7 m"," 15.2 lbs | 6.9 kg"," Overgrow |"," "," Monster | Grass"," Monster | Grass","

"2","Ivysaur","002","Kanto forests and jungles","Upon evolution from Bulbasaur, Ivysaur become larger and more powerful. However, as a trade-off for their bulk, they also lose their ability to stand on their hind legs due to the mass of the bulbs on their backs. Their legs also grow stronger to compensate for the extra weight. Ivysaur are able to naturally learn the powerful Grass-type attack Solar Beam, a move whose execution time depends largely upon the weather; it takes an excruciatingly long amount of time to perform this attack in hail, rain, or a sandstorm, but nearly no time at all in bright sunlight. Luckily, the latter is ​most common in the habitats of these Pokémon, as it is vital that the bulbs on their backs receive ample sunlight so that they can photosynthesize and develop. As the bulbs grow larger and these Ivysaur become more powerful, they must spend increasing amounts of time in the sun in order to foster their growth. When Ivysaur are preparing to evolve into Venusaur, they will spend more time sunbathing and their bulbs will begin emanating a sweet, pleasant aroma.","﻿Evolves from Bulbasaur at Lvl 16Evolves into Venusaur at Lvl 32","Grass/Poison"," 3'03\" | 1.0 m"," 28.7 lbs | 13.0 kg"," Overgrow |"," "," Monster | Grass"," Monster | Grass","

"3","Venusaur","003","Kanto forests and jungles","The final evolution of Bulbasaur, Venusaur are powerful but relatively nonviolent Pokémon. Despite their menacing appearances, Venusaur are docile Pokémon, preferring to sunbathe so that the plants on their backs can photosynthesize rather than fight. They follow sunny patches that reach the forest floor as the sun moves across the sky. With enough solar energy, the flowers on their backs can release a fragrance that calms both hostile Pokémon and people alike. The scent also attracts a number of Bug-type Pokémon to the flowers as well to aid in their pollination during the breeding season. This ability allows Venusaur to serve as peacekeepers of sorts in their native forests, not only stopping fights that break out in their territories, but also defending their domains from dangers with their might if necessary. Female Venusaur have seeds in their flowers, which they plant into the backs of their offspring to grow into new plants. Their gentle dispositions but great power are what make them one of the most well-rounded Pokémon any Kanto trainer could start their Pokémon journeys with.","Bulbasaur evolves into Ivysaur at Lvl 16Evolves from Ivysaur at Lvl 32Can Mega Evolve into Mega Venusaur","Grass/Poison"," 6'07\" | 2.0 m"," 220.5 lbs | 100.0 kg"," Overgrow |"," "," Monster | Grass"," Monster | Grass","

"4","Charmander","004","Kanto mountains and volcanoes","Charmander are rare Pokémon not often found in the wild, making their homes in volcanoes and mountains--particularly those with nooks and crags that can easily provide protection from the weather. This is because the flames on their tails are directly linked to their well-being. A flame that burns brightly signals a healthy Pokémon, while a dim, sputtering flame indicates a sickly one. Charmander will die if their fires go out. Their flames steam when in high humidity, warning them of potential danger. These flames also indicate their emotions. Gently wavering flames signal happiness, while blazing tails mean anger. Despite being Fire-types, Charmander are not immune to fire; infant ones, in fact, often burn themselves on their own tails. However, like many Fire-types, they do have an affinity for hot things, and their skin does toughen as they age. Despite the many dangers and precautions raising Charmander may pose,  they still remain one of the most popular starter Pokémon for trainers in the Kanto region.","﻿Evolves into Charmeleon at Lvl 16Charmeleon evolves into Charizard at Lvl 36","Research Notes","Fire"," 2'04\" | 0.6 m"," 18.7 lbs | 8.5 kg"," Blaze |","Solar Power","Solar Power","

Charmeleon attack by knocking their foes down with their blazing tails and slashing them mercilessly with their sharp claws, not ceasing until their enemies are thoroughly beaten. In their fervor, their tails often begin to burn a bluish-white; at night, they can light up mountainsides like stars if groups of them are present. Enraged Charmeleon often take out their anger on their surroundings, incinerating anything flammable around them with unrestrained Flamethrowers. This stage is often likened to a human’s teenage years--moody and reckless. For starting trainers, reining in disobedient Charmeleon can be extremely challenging, as well as potentially dangerous if not handled well. However, with proper care and treatment, a trainer can earn a Charmeleon’s respect, and eventually its obedience as well.","Evolves from Charmander at Lvl 16Evolves into Charizard at Lvl 36","Research Notes","Fire"," 3'07\" | 1.1 m"," 41.9 lbs | 19.0 kg"," Blaze |","Solar Power","Solar Power","

"6","Charizard","006","Kanto mountains and volcanoes","Charizard can spew powerful flames that can melt boulders and glaciers--and rather unfortunately, also easily and unintentionally start forest fires. For this reason, it is common courtesy to recall any Pokémon that have uncontrollable flames (like the ones on the tails of Charizard) back into their Poké Balls in heavily forested areas. A Charizard’s flame temperature increases with training, and it is said that Charizard that have experienced particularly brutal battles have even hotter flames. Like Charmeleon, an enraged Charizard’s flames can burn a whitish-blue. Unlike them, however, Charizard can more easily control their their tempers; they will nobly never attack foes weaker than themselves. Charizard can fly almost 4,600 feet (1,400 meters) into the air, soaring far above the mountains and volcanoes they call home. Trainers who manage to protect their vulnerable Charmander and then deal with their moody Charmeleon are rewarded with noble and powerful Charizard to call their own.","﻿Charmander into Charmeleon at Lvl 16Evolves from Charmeleon at Lvl 36​Can Mega Evolve into Mega Charizard X or Mega Charizard YCertain Charizard can Gigantamax into Gigantamax Charizard","Research Notes","Fire/Flying"," 5'07\" | 1.7 m"," 199.5 lbs | 90.5 kg"," Blaze |","Solar Power","Solar Power","

"7","Squirtle","007","Kanto lakes and ponds","Squirtle are born with soft shells, and are vulnerable until these shells harden in a process that takes about a week or so. To protect themselves, they withdraw into their sturdy shells and attack using Bubble and Water Gun to scare off potential dangers. Their carapaces can bounce back many attacks, protecting the Pokémon from harm. Additionally, the smooth exteriors of the shells allow Squirtle to glide more swiftly and smoothly through the water. Though rare in the wild, they can occasionally be found around freshwater lakes and ponds, and even in slow-flowing rivers. A few ​isolated populations can be found on islands in the middle of the ocean, but these groups are rare and are exceptions rather than the norm. Squirtle are often found in groups, which while officially are referred to as “bales,” are more popularly known as a “squads.” Squirtle, the third of the Kanto starter trio, are often viewed as a middle ground between the other two; not as docile as Bulbasaur, but not as rash as Charmander.","Evolves into Wartortle at Lvl 16Wartortle evolves into Blastoise at Lvl 36","Water"," 1'08\" | 0.5 m"," 19.8 lbs | 9.0 kg"," Torrent |"," "," Monster | Water 1"," Monster | Water 1","

These tails, rather humorously, stick out of their shells even when the rest of their bodies are withdrawn. They use water to cloak themselves before attacking prey and swiftly swimming after them, using their ears and tails to balance themselves. Wartortle are said to live 10,000 years; it is thought that individuals with more deeply-colored tails and more algae on their shells are older. While this holds true to an extent, Wartortle have not actually been documented to live this long, though they regularly surpass 100 years of age. Because of this, Wartortle tails are regarded as symbols of longevity. In the past, people would hunt Wartortle and hold locks of their tail fur in hopes of living long lives. Wartortle pride themselves on scratched shells, as they show toughness in battle. Generally, it is believed that the more scratches a Wartortle gains during this stage, the stronger it will be after evolution.","﻿Evolves from Squirtle at Lvl 16Evolves into Blastoise at Lvl 36","Water"," 3'03\" | 1.0 m"," 49.6 lbs | 22.5 kg"," Torrent |"," "," Monster | Water 1"," Monster | Water 1","

These cannons are stronger than fire hoses, and can shoot water over 160 feet (50 meters) away with enough force to break through concrete and solid steel. Additionally, Blastoise can use these cannons to jet themselves through the water to tackle foes at high speeds. Blastoise intentionally make themselves heavy for multiple reasons. Weight adds power to these jet-tackles, for example, and also allows them to crush foes on land. Most importantly, however it enables them to withstand the recoil from their powerful cannon blasts.  These blasts are accurate as well as powerful; bullets of water shot from these cannons can hit and destroy tin cans situated 160 feet away. As a last resort, Blastoise can withdraw into their thick and sturdy shells for protection. Like the other Kanto starters, Blastoise are extremely powerful Pokémon that any Pokémon trainer would be lucky to have.","﻿Squirtle evolves into Wartortle at Lvl 16Evolves from Wartortle at Lvl 36​Can Mega Evolve into Mega Blastoise","Water"," 5'03\" | 1.6 m"," 188.5 lbs | 88.5 kg"," Torrent |"," "," Monster | Water 1"," Monster | Water 1","

They are ravenous eaters, often consuming leaves larger than themselves with ease. As weak, soft-bodied Pokémon, Caterpie attempt to gather as much energy as possible to hasten their evolutions into Metapod, and afterwards into Butterfree. However, they are not completely defenseless and do have a few tricks up their sleeves. Firstly, the large eyes on their heads can trick and confuse predators into thinking they are dealing with much larger Pokémon. Secondly, the suction pads on their feet allow them to climb nearly any surface and escape from predators. Additionally, Caterpie can use String Shot to slow down their enemies and buy time for escape. Finally, the antennae on their heads release a very noxious odor when disturbed. These defense mechanisms allow Caterpie to thrive in their native habitats, and combined with the large clutch sizes of Butterfree, make them are one of the most common Pokémon trainers encounter in forests.","Evolves into Metapod at Lvl 7Metapod evolves into ﻿Butterfree﻿ at Lvl 10","Bug"," 1'00\" | 0.3 m"," 6.4 lbs | 2.9 kg"," Shield Dust |"," "," Bug"," Bug","

These cocoons, while still vulnerable when soft, will eventually harden into iron-hard casings, triggering their evolutions into Metapod. A Metapod’s only defense is to use Harden; when under attack, they weather blows by raising their defenses, though extremely hard blows can occasionally crack their shells and expose their weak, liquid-like innards. They must conserve their energy to prepare for their final evolutions. To avoid attacks, these Pokémon stay motionless and simply ​wait. Metapod are remarkably patient, enduring whatever pain they must to reach their final stages. They must remain upright while biding their time or risk spilling out their innards. They are often regarded as nearly useless in battle, as freshly-caught Metapod are incapable of damaging foes at all (other than by using Struggle). Luckily, however, the Caterpie line undergoes some of the quickest evolutions known to date, and it does not take very long for Metapod to finally evolve into Butterfree.","Evolves from Caterpie at Lvl 7Evolves into Butterfree at Lvl 10","Bug"," 2'04\" | 0.7 m"," 21.8 lbs | 9.9 kg"," Shed Skin"," Bug","Habitat","Habitat","

The wings they gain can let loose Poison Powder in battle; they are also water-repellant, allowing Butterfree to fly even in torrential rain. Butterfree consume honey from flowers and are excellent at detecting sources of it. They can trace minutes amounts of pollen back to flower patches, where they then feast on honey and nectar. Using the hairs on their legs, Butterfree are also able to carry the sticky substance back to their nests. They often fly as far as 6 miles (10 kilometers) to find nectar in blooming flowers. These Pokémon also have powerful compound eyes. Because of their water-resistant wings, Butterfree can often be found fluttering about in the misty upper levels of rainforests. However, the high moisture is not necessary for their survival; they are simply highly tolerant of it, so they are also found in drier forests as well, often flying in small swarms to search out locations where honey is abundant. They sometimes compete with Cutiefly for territory.","Caterpie evolves into Metapod at Lvl 7Evolves from Metapod at Lvl 10Certain Butterfree can Gigantamax into Gigantamax Butterfree","Bug/Flying"," 3'07\" | 1.1 m"," 70.5 lbs | 32.0 kg"," Compound Eyes | Tinted Lens"," Bug","Overview","Overview","

They are voracious eaters, consuming their weight in leaves daily. Though they appear helpless at a first glance, Weedle are in fact poisonous. The 2-inch (5 centimeter) barbs on their heads secrete a poison that, while not fatal, can be debilitating and cause moderate nausea, dizziness, and mild swelling at injured areas. The abundance of Weedle in dense forests makes accidental injuries and subsequent poisonings a very ​common problem among travelers. Trainers are advised to always carry Pecha Berries or Antidotes with them and to watch their step in Kanto and Johto forests. The stingers and brightly-colored bodies of these Pokémon are intended to ward off potential predators who would not enjoy a mouthful of toxins. Weedle also have a sharp sense of smell, using their nose-like proboscises to sense which leaves are safe to consume. Some Weedle even develop preferences for certain leaves.","Evolves into Kakuna at Lvl 7Kakuna evolves into Beedrill at Lvl 10","Bug/Poison"," 1'00\" | 0.3 m"," 7.1 lbs | 3.2 kg"," Shield Dust |"," "," Bug"," Bug","

They can sometimes be seen hanging from tree branches on strands of silk in large numbers. Kakuna can only learn Harden naturally. When provoked, though, they can also extend poison barbs from their tips slightly to defend themselves. These Pokémon try to conserve as much energy as possible for evolution, however, so they will only exert energy to unsheathe their barbs when absolutely necessary. Their hard cocoons protect the soft bodies within, which essentially liquify as they reconfigure themselves for evolution. This process, a fervor of activity that contrasts their immobility, causes their internal body temperatures to rise drastically, so much so that the shells of Kakuna nearing evolution feel uncomfortably hot to the touch. Their bodies only continue to heat up as they draw closer to their final transformations.","﻿Evolves from Weedle at Lvl 7Evolves into Beedrill at Lvl 10","Bug/Poison"," 2'00\" | 0.6 m"," 22.0 lbs | 10.0 kg"," Shed Skin"," Bug","Habitat","Habitat","

Beedrill are extremely territorial, attacking anything that perceive as threats in swarms. They fly in at high speeds and jab foes with their stingers before taking them back to their nests for food. Theoretically, avoiding Beedrill swarm territory should allow travelers to avoid confrontation with these Pokémon. While this is true, complications arise when considering the fact that Beedrill are a rather abundant Pokémon; the combined territories of multiple swarms can take up the majority of a forest. While dangerous, however, Beedrill are also vital to the ecosystems of Kanto and Johto forests, helping prevent populations of Pokémon such as Paras and Pidgey from growing uncontrollably. Trainers traveling in Beedrill territory are strongly advised to bring along Pokémon that can handle Beedrill and their attacks, such as Twineedle and Poison Jab, as well as to bring along a number Pecha Berries and Antidotes.","﻿Weedle evolves into Kakuna at Lvl 7Evolves from Kakuna at Lvl 10Can Mega Evolve into Mega Beedrill","Bug/Poison"," 3'03\" | 1.0 m"," 65.0 lbs | 29.5 kg"," Swarm | Sniper"," Bug","Habitat","Habitat","

If cornered, though, they will attempt to escape by using Sand Attack to blind foes or Whirlwind to blow them away and buy themselves time to fly away. When hunting, however, Pidgey often use these attacks to stir up their surroundings, exposing vulnerable insects for them to chase down. These Pokémon have extremely keen senses of direction. They can always find their way back to their nests regardless of how far they have flown. Because of this, Pidgey were commonly used to send messages in the Kanto and Johto regions (much like the Wingull of Hoenn), at least until the advent of e-mail. Many Pidgey have grown accustomed to and now dwell in urban areas due to this practice, flying to forests and fields only to hunt for food before returning back to their nests in cities. Some people still train Pidgey to deliver messages as a way of preserving tradition.","Evolves into Pidgeotto at Lvl 18Pidgeotto evolves into Pidgeot at Lvl 36","Normal/Flying"," 1'00\" | 0.3 m"," 4.0 lbs | 1.8 kg"," Keen Eye | Tangled Feet |"," "," Flying"," Flying","

Pidgeotto have outstanding vision, and are able to locate prey over a mile (1.6 kilometers) below. When they spot something, such as a Caterpie for example, they will dive down and attack with their sharp talons and powerful beaks. Like Pidgey, they have keen sense of direction in addition to their strength; Pidgeotto can carry ​prey back to their nests with ease, and can travel over 60 miles (100 kilometers) in the process. Due to their extremely territorial natures, most urban Pidgey nearing evolution migrate, often in flocks, to the nearby forests where they hunt; they then split up and stake out their own territories.

If they are not endangering the Pokémon or their offspring, they will leave them be. However, they will defeat potential threats without hesitation using their powerful chest muscles to whip up windstorms strong enough to bend tall trees. While hunting, Pidgeot can spot prey from 3,300 feet (1,000 meters). They dive down to lake surfaces to snatch splashing Magikarp with their sharp talons, reaching speeds of up to Mach 2.

They can be a nuisance, as they eat nearly anything and are extremely quick, seemingly unable to stay still for long periods of time. If a Rattata locates food, it will call upon its group-mates to join it. They will then settle in the area and reproduce continuously. In addition to consuming ​large amounts of food, Rattata also pack a vicious bite. They can potentially pass diseases through puncture wounds. Their teeth never stop growing, so they must constantly gnaw on hard objects to whittle them down or risk starvation, unable to close their mouths. They often use manmade objects such as telephone poles for this purpose. All this together makes Rattata huge household pests, so many employ Pokémon like Meowth and Glameow to deal with them.","Evolves into Raticate at Lvl 20Also see Alolan Rattata","Normal"," 1'00\" | 0.3 m"," 7.7 lbs | 3.5 kg"," Run Away | Guts |"," Hustle"," Field"," Field","

Like their pre-evolutions, Raticate must constantly whittle down their teeth. In the wild, they gnaw on rocks and logs to keep them in prime condition, but urban Raticate often choose to whittle on concrete and cinder walls of houses, a danger to many homes. Their whiskers provide them with balance; if they are damaged or cut off, the coordination and speed of these Pokémon are cut drastically. Their hind feet are adapted to swimming, allowing them to easily cross rivers. If a Raticate feels threatened, it will stand on its hind legs and let out an shrill shriek, calling its group-mates to join and defend it. The best way to defend against Raticate in the home is to prevent Rattata from invading in the first place before they evolve. Alternatively, Persian and Purugly can also deal with Raticate.","​﻿Evolves from Rattata at Lvl 20​Also see Alolan Raticate","Research NotesAlolan Form","Normal"," 2'04\" | 0.7 m"," 40.8 lbs | 18.5 kg"," Run Away | Guts |"," Field"," Field","

Spearow are highly aggressive and territorial, closely observing their land and letting out high-pitched shrieks that can be heard from over a half-mile (a kilometer) away to alert fellow Spearow of potential dangers. Though territorial against other Pokémon, Spearow are not solitary and will coexist with others of their kind. Their calls signal nearby Spearow to flock together and attack. Because they almost always attack in large flocks, Spearow can be very formidable foes despite their small size and individual weakness. Lone Spearow can be reckless when facing large foes, however. Flocks can be dangerous to unwary travelers, so trainers must always be cautious of Spearow cries while traveling through their territory.

When hunting, Fearow soar high up into the air. When they spot prey, they dive down below and attack (often the common Rattata or their fellow Flying-type Pokémon Pidgey) with their long beaks. They use their narrow beaks to dig through soil or reach below the water to catch prey if needed. Because they are known to attack Pokémon often viewed as “cute” and “popular”, such as Pichu, Fearow are often maligned in popular culture as wicked, heartless fighters.

They mainly prey on the defenseless eggs of Pidgey and Spearow. Using their tongues to sense their surroundings, Ekans are able to locate nests of eggs with ease. They can unhinge their jaws and swallow eggs whole, though unlucky Ekans may end up immobile from the sheer weight of those eggs until digestion (or even fainted if attempting huge eggs). Hiding in tall grass, Ekans avoid predators and warn those who approach with a rattling sound from their tails. Should the sound fail, they will attempt to paralyze attackers with Glare, and as a last resort bite opponents to poison them.

Once their prey are immobilized, Arbok will constrict them with a crushing force able to flatten steel oil drums. They can easily poison stronger foes, weakening them enough for them to constrict easily. ​Surprisingly, Arbok are rather adept swimmers as well, capable of crossing lakes and rivers effortlessly. Notably, Arbok seem to become mesmerized and peaceful upon hearing the sound of wind instruments like Poké Flutes. An Arbok in the middle of constricting its prey will even loosen its grip upon hearing such sounds.

"26","Raichu","026","Forests, areas with electrical activity","Raichu are a rarity in the wild, as exposure to Thunder Stones is necessary to catalyze their evolutions from Pikachu. Most Raichu are trainer-owned, though there are a few in the wild living in areas near their Pikachu brethren. Raichu can unleash extremely strong electrical attacks reaching up to 100,000 volts at a time for their more powerful moves. They ground their tails to discharge excess electricity from into the earth, leaving behind scorch marks. Their strong electrical powers lead them to constantly exude weak electrical charges, causing them to glow faintly in the ​dark. These Pokémon can draw electricity straight from the atmosphere simply by raising their tails. Their electricity levels are directly linked with their moods; a Raichu with little electricity is weak and depressed, while one that is filled to the brim is powerful and even aggressive at times. Notably, an angered, fully-charged Raichu’s ears stand straight on end, a warning sign for enemies to quickly back away.","Pichu evolves into Pikachu with high happinessEvolves from Pikachu with a Thunder StoneAlso see Alolan Raichu","Electric"," 2'07\" | 0.8 m"," 66.1 lbs | 30.0 kg"," Static |"," Lightning Rod"," Field | Fairy"," Field | Fairy","

"27","Sandshrew","027","Caves, grasslands, deserts","Sandshrew live in arid climates, as they hate water. They create burrows underground for shelter. When hunting, they wait near the lips of their burrows, lunging out at unsuspecting prey. Sandshrew can roll up into tight balls when endangered to protect their soft underbellies. Their hides can bounce off many attacks, and are additionally also great shock absorbers. A Sandshrew falling off a cliff, for example, could save itself by rolling into a ball; it would be able to not only survive the impact, but even crawl away mostly unscathed. Their bodies are also configured to live off as little water as possible, since they are extremely weak to the liquid. Sandshrew often curl up into balls on cold nights to prevent dew from building up on their bellies. If wet, they will sunbathe or even travel to volcanic areas to dry off. While rolling up is a sufficient defense against most enemies, Sandshrew can also use Sand Attack and curiously Poison Sting to defend themselves, as their claws secrete a mild poison. Recently, researchers have discovered that their saliva in fact contains the same poison.","﻿Evolves into Sandslash at Lvl 22Also see Alolan Sandshrew","Ground"," 2'00\" | 0.6 m"," 26.5 lbs | 12.0 kg"," Sand Veil |"," Sand Rush"," Field"," Field","

Sandslash can roll around in their spiky armor and ram into foes, severely damaging them with their spikes. Their claws also make them great climbers, so it is not uncommon for them to launch aerial spike-attacks at opponents from trees. They can also slash enemies with their sharp claws, if the spikes on their hides were not enough. However, Sandslash prefer not to fight, and will often simply roll away from confrontation or quickly roll around to whip up cloaks of sand for them to escape. Sandslash burrow through soil at great speeds; occasionally, they move so quickly that one their spikes or claws snap off. Luckily for them, though, these can grow back in as little as a day. Their spikes naturally fall off as new spikes replace older ones; discarded growths were once used by farmers to plow fields. Sandslash also have a two-fold resistance to the heat: they can curl up to protect themselves from the arid sun or burrow into the cooler earth. In favorable weather, they may even climb into treetops to take naps.","Evolves from Sandshrew at Lvl 22Also see Alolan Sandslash","Ground"," 3'03\" | 1.0 m"," 65.0 lbs | 29.5 kg"," Sand Veil |"," Sand Rush"," Field"," Field","

To make matters worse, Nidoran♀ are easily spooked, and it is not at all difficult to accidentally be scratched by a fleeing individual. If cornered, however, Nidoran♀ will defend themselves with their horns; while these horns are smaller than that of the males of this species, they still nevertheless are very dangerous. They may attack with Poison Sting or Double Kick as they try to escape, the former of which incapacitates foes ​while the latter knocks them back, allowing the Pokémon to flee. It is rare to find a lone Nidoran♀, as they are very social Pokémon that are almost never seen without elder Nidorina and Nidoqueen, or at the very least sibling Nidoran♂, accompanying them. In fact, the vast majority of documented cases of Nidoran♀ poisonings have been attributed to skittish and scared wild individuals attacking out of sheer terror after having been separated from their families.","Evolves into Nidorina at Lvl 16Nidorina evolves into Nidoqueen with a Moon StoneAlso see Nidoran♂, Nidorino, and Nidoking","Poison"," 1'04\" | 0.4 m"," 15.4 lbs | 7.0 kg"," Poison Point | Rivalry |"," "," Monster | Field"," Monster | Field","

Like the rest of their relatives, they lives in burrows in open plains with their large family groups. Unlike those of Nidorino, a Nidorina’s horn and barbs grow rather slowly, as it is not necessary for them to develop quickly because they are very rarely used (males do most of the defending in a family). These Pokémon are very affectionate with those in their tightly-bonded family groups, and can easily become nervous or even upset when separated from them. Nidorina withdraw their spikes when interacting with family members to prevent themselves from harming each other.

They will tackle foes who threaten their young with their massive bulk. Their tough armor and needle-like scales provide them with protection; they bristle outwards when Nidoqueen are provoked and can inject a powerful, incapacitating poison. These Pokémon will block the entrances to their burrows using their bodies, with their venomous spines facing outwards, in order to defend their young. Nidoqueen are also known to set off earth-shaking tremors to scare potential attackers from their burrows.

Their muscles allow for their ears to move freely. They can hone in on the smallest sounds. By hiding in tall grass and raising and stiffening their ears just above it, Nidoran♂ can scan their surroundings and use their ears to detect danger from far away. To defend themselves, they can extend toxic spikes from their bodies or stab enemies with their horns by using Poison Jab. The toxicity of their barbs directly correlates to their sizes, but even small barbs can be extremely dangerous. Like females, however, males are shy and try to avoid fights, only using their venom to defend themselves as necessary when confronted. Nidoran♂ are herbivores and consume plants as their main source of food, and can even devour toxic ones without any ill effects; some scientists even believe that Nidoran♂ gather their poison from such plants.","Evolves into ﻿Nidorino﻿ at Lvl 16Nidorino evolves into Nidoking with a Moon StoneAlso see Nidoran♀, Nidorina, and Nidoqueen","Poison"," 1'08\" | 0.5 m"," 19.8 lbs | 9.0 kg"," Poison Point | Rivalry |"," "," Monster | Field"," Monster | Field","

Once they stab their opponents, Nidorino quickly pump in large amounts of venom to incapacitate them (a Nidorino’s horns will leak out venom slowly from the impact, but the Pokémon can exert energy to increase this rate). Like those of Nidorina, the barbs on their bodies bristle when they sense danger or are preparing to attack. These Pokémon generally spend the day scouting and searching for food, returning to their burrows only at night to rest. They bring back resources to share with the rest of their families. However, even the slightest noise will awaken sleeping Nidorino, thanks to their highly sensitive ears.

They use their brute strength and steel-like armor to overpower their foes, crushing their enemies with their tails and piercing them with their poisonous horns, which, like those of Nidorino, can break diamonds. An enraged Nidoking is particularly dangerous, as it will go on a rampage that can only be stopped by defeating the Pokémon--a difficult task that only a few Pokémon can accomplish. Nidoking can easily topple transmission towers and snap telephone poles, and will destroy everything in their paths while rampaging. Threatening their families is one of the most common triggers for such attacks. Luckily, their rarity in the wild in combination with their tendency to stay away from human settlements makes berserk Nidoking a very rare, albeit still very dangerous, problem in most metropolitan areas.","Nidoran♂ evolves into Nidorino at Lvl 16Evolves from Nidorino with a Moon StoneAlso see Nidoran♀, Nidorina, and Nidoqueen","Poison/","Ground",""," 4'07\" | 1.4 m"," 136.7 lbs | 62.0 kg"," "," ","

Little is known about these elusive Pokémon; however, they seem to be intelligent enough to form societies, build transportation, and develop religions. Many theories have formed regarding these popular Pokémon. One explains their tendencies to steal things as gathering materials to build spaceships to take them back home. Known for their mystical powers, Clefairy can use the move Metronome by waggling their fingers, summoning a completely random attack out of thin air. They also very strongly connected to the moon. Clefairy mysteriously become more common during full moons as they come out of hiding and dance.

Clefable are extremely shy, hiding at the slightest hint of people. Their ears are very sensitive, able to hear a pin drop from 1,100 yards (1,000 meters) away. They avoid loud places by hiding in groups deep in secluded mountains. Clefable move very lightly, almost as if bouncing in lower, moon-like gravity; they are also able to walk on water in this way. On moonlit nights, they can rarely be seen walking towards secluded, deserted lakes; they are said to gaze at the moon in longing to return home. It is said seeing a pair of them is a sign of a happy marriage. Little is known about how Clefable defend themselves; they are able to learn Metronome like Clefairy, allowing them to summon essentially any move.

Vulpix have internal flames that never die out, radiating heat throughout their fur. They may release flames from their mouths to expel excess heat and cool themselves down on hot days. They often attack foes with Fire-type techniques such as Flamethrower and Ember, but also have control over a few Ghost-type moves like Confuse Ray, Hex, and Grudge. Vulpix are often associated with the attack Will-O-Wisp, which they use to chase down prey. To escape from foes, they may feign injury to buy themselves time to flee. Though they generally make their homes in grassy plains, as Fire-types, Vulpix also can be found near volcanoes in large populations—and curiously enough, also near cemeteries such as Mt.

The Pokémon themselves are said to live 1,000 years. It is also believed that each of their tails holds a different power; a Ninetales would lay a different curse on a handler depending on which tail was touched. These Pokémon are highly intelligent and can fully understand human speech. They are also said to be able to manipulate others; staring into their glowing red eyes would allow them to take over one’s mind. Their fur is said to turn more golden and lustrous the older they become. Despite all of these claims, none of these myths about Ninetales have ever been scientifically proven to be true.

They sing at a wavelength that matches the brainwaves of a person in deep sleep, causing all who hear them to become immediately drowsy. CD recordings of their singing are sold as sleeping aids. They have a vocal range of over twelve octaves, though they rarely exercise it in full. In battle, Jigglypuff enrapture foes with their huge eyes before singing them to sleep; they then use Pound and Double Slap to assault them. They can also inflate their bodies, giving them the name “the Balloon Pokémon.” In addition to allowing them to easily float upon the winds, this ability also increases the air capacity of their lungs and allows them to sing for for longer periods of time, letting them lull foes into even deeper slumbers. However, most Jigglypuff are not accustomed to Pokémon with abilities like Insomnia, which prevent drowsiness. They will sing endlessly to try to put such Pokémon to sleep, putting themselves in danger of asphyxiation. Luckily, this behavior is generally a one-time mistake, and a Jigglypuff will quickly learn its lesson.

At night, Zubat may leave their caves in large groups, with as many as 10,000 individuals having been documented leaving from caverns where they are more abundant, such as Mt. Moon. They search for food on these nightly flights, which,contrary to popular belief and unlike the diets of their evolutions, consists mostly of nectar, fruits, and Berries. As daylight approaches, Zubat must return to their caves or other dark places, as the light of the sun can burn their delicate skin. To stay warm on cold nights, they will huddle together in groups as they sleep. Zubat defend themselves with moves like the disorienting Supersonic and attacks such as Leech Life, which they may use on unwary, intruding travelers.

Golbat can drink up to 10 ounces of blood in one sitting, possibly fatal for smaller victims. After doing so, however, their flight often becomes clumsy and erratic due to their heavy weights after large meals; they may become so heavy that they fall to the ground (and become easy prey themselves). Luckily, this feasting keeps them satisfied for a while; they only search for food during moonless nights when darkness conceals them. Their fangs are hollow and consequently fragile.

If that is not enough to deter predators, these Pokémon can use moves like Poison Powder, Stun Spore, and Sleep Powder to inflict a variety of status conditions upon foes. Their feet act as roots when buried in the soil, absorbing nutrients from the earth. Healthier Oddish have glossier leaves. When exposed to moonlight, Oddish uproot themselves and begin to wander aimlessly in search of fertile soil. Along the way as they travel, they disperse some of their seeds onto their paths. Oddish leaves are known to be poisonous, and at the very least, cause surreal hallucinations upon consumption. For a brief time, people would consume Oddish leaves recreationally, but the craze quickly ended when the more toxic side effects, such as permanent liver damage, were discovered.

Though the smell is unbearable to most people, there are a select few individuals, roughly 1 in 1,000, that actually enjoy the smell (notably including every trainer and Gym Leader Erika in the Kanto Celadon Gym). The “drool” from their mouths is actually a foul-smelling honey, used to attract their insect prey. In a constant cycle, the smell of the honey cause Gloom to become excited, which in turn cause them to produce even more of their putrid honey, and more of their equally foul pollen as well. Despite the smell, however, Gloom honey is reportedly sweet once one overlooks the stench. It is a very sticky substance, however, that is difficult to remove from clothing.

Studies show that the larger the flowers are, the more poisonous their pollen is. The smell of the flowers attracts prey; when they draw close, Vileplume flap their petals, cloaking themselves and their targets in toxic pollen that quickly immobilizes victims. Even as they walk, Vileplume scatter pollen out of their blooms, turning the surrounding air a sickly yellow. This pollen can cause poisoning and paralysis in large amounts, but can also trigger massive allergy attacks in even trace amounts. Like Oddish and Gloom, Vileplume may hide partially buried in the soil, only exposing their flowers for unwary prey to investigate.

Paras must feed ravenously as a result. Recent discoveries have shown that the mushrooms also control part of their hosts’ brains, and in fact are the ones that signal for Paras to burrow for roots. Paras can be found in damp, dark areas where fungi thrive; sunlight and dryness can damage their bodies. To defend themselves, the fungi release spores to inflict a variety of status effects upon foes. Paras are sometimes seen as pests, as they harm tree roots. However, since they generally live in areas away from humans, they normally cause few problems. The mushrooms on their backs are actually considered very valuable in traditional medicine.

"50","Diglett","050","Subterranean caves and tunnels, deserts","Diglett are very popular yet very mysterious Pokémon. They mostly live underground eating plant roots and insects, but pop up on the surface or in caves from time to time. However, they never reveal any more than their heads; to this day, no one knows what the rest of a Diglett’s body looks like. As Diglett tunnel through soil, they leave the land perfectly tilled for crops. This makes them very popular among some farmers, who gladly let a few of them loose into their fields. It is a mutually beneficial relationship; the Diglett till the soil for the farmers, and in turn are allowed to eat the roots of some of crops before harvest. They can be huge pests in fields they should not be in, however. Diglett traveling near the surface often leave trails of displaced soil, making them rather easy to track. Diglett cannot stay aboveground for long, as their thin skin is especially sensitive to light. Excess exposure to the sun can cause them to overheat, weakening them greatly. They makes most of their aboveground travels at night for this reason.","Evolves into Dugtrio at Lvl 26​Also see Alolan Diglett","Ground"," 0'08\" | 0.2 m"," 1.8 lbs | 0.8 kg"," Sand Veil | Arena Trap |"," "," Field"," Field","

What is known, however, is that a Dugtrio’s three heads tend to think identically as triplets, as opposed to separately like other three-headed Pokémon such as Dodrio. Upon evolution, a Diglett’s single head splits into three separate ones, enabling it to burrow and plow soil at three times its original rate. By loosening the soil with their heads, they also make the earth easier to burrow through. Dugtrio can dig at 60 mph (100 km/h), and can cause minor earthquakes by doing so at depths of over 60 miles (100 kilometers) below sea level, easily burrowing through even hard bedrock. To defend themselves, Dugtrio burrow deep underground so that their opponents cannot locate where they will strike. Then, they surprise foes by emerging behind them and attacking with moves like Earthquake and Magnitude.","﻿Evolves from Diglett at Lvl 26​Also see Alolan Dugtrio","Ground"," 2'04\" | 0.7 m"," 73.4 lbs | 33.3 kg"," Sand Veil | Arena Trap |"," "," Field"," Field","

"52","Meowth","052","Urban towns and cities, forests","Meowth are urban Pokémon that make their homes in towns and cities (a few feral Meowth also dwell in the forests bordering such cities). They are nocturnal in nature, sleeping through the day and prowling the streets at night. While generally solitary, Meowth are known to form groups that band together in search for round or shiny objects, both of which they treasure. When they find round objects like balls, they will often play with them until they tire out and fall asleep. On the other hand, when Meowth find shiny objects--most commonly loose change dropped by people--they will hoard them in large, hidden piles, which they will only share with those they trust deeply. The coins on their heads glow when they find shiny things. When stalking, their eyes gleam brightly in the moonlight. Moewth retract their claws to muffle their steps. Meowth prowl about to defend their hordes from their archenemies, Murkrow, who also have a fondness for shiny things. Meowth and Murkrow will try to steal from each other’s stashes and will duel in alleys for piles of coins. Wild Meowth will quickly befriend anyone who gifts them with shiny objects, but will lose interest just as quickly once they stop receiving presents.","Evolves into Persian at Lvl 28​Also see Alolan Meowth and Galarian MeowthCertain Meowth can Gigantamax into Gigantamax Meowth","Alolan FormGalarian Form","Normal"," 1'04\" | 0.4 m"," 9.3 lbs | 4.2 kg"," Pickup | Technician |"," Field"," Field","

However, they are extremely difficult to control and are prone to slashing those that make eye contact with or displease them (which is nearly everyone) with their claws, leaving deep gashes. The jewels on their heads glow in the darkness. Persian judge each other by the sizes of their jewels. In some regions, poachers target these Pokémon for these shiny growths. Despite their fickleness, Persian are very graceful creatures—another reason why they are so popular. Their lithe muscles allow them to walk silently while remaining ready to pounce at any second. Persian use their whiskers to scout around their domains, sensing air movements and using the information to plan their attacks accordingly. They will become docile, however, if these whiskers are grabbed or damaged. While some trainers remove their Persian’s whiskers to prevent them from lashing out, some see this as form of abuse, as their removal strictly limits a Persian’s abilities to hunt, battle, and defend itself.","Evolves from Meowth at Lvl 28​Also see Alolan Persian","Normal"," 3'03\" | 1.0 m"," 70.5 lbs | 32.0 kg"," Limber | Technician |"," Unnerve"," Field"," Field","

"54","Psyduck","054","Temperate lakes and ponds, tropical rivers","Psyduck suffer from constant headaches, and for that reason are always holding their heads in pain; sometimes they even cry as a result. However, when their pain worsens, they gain psychokinetic powers on par with many Psychic-types. Curiously, once the majority of their suffering subsides, they are unable to remember such incidents, as if they underwent amnesia immediately after every psychic episode. This causes them much confusion; they are always is in a state of bewilderment as a result, tilting their heads slightly to one side. At one time, it was believed that Psyduck used their vacant stares to fool predators into thinking that they were easy prey before attacking with their psychic powers. However, we now know that Psyduck have no control whatsoever over their powers--in fact, the majority of their brain cells are dormant, in a state very similar to that of a person in deep sleep. Psyduck gain their abilities when these cells become active, but as soon as they retire, they completely forget about their powers again. Recent research has shown that their brain cells become hyperactive during their migraines, increasing activity by as much as tenfold. Some studies show that a mild positive feedback loop may exist between their brain activity and psychokinesis, such that using psychokinesis activates their brain cells and activating their brain cells increases their psychokinesis; as a result, these Pokémon try to think as little as possible and instead stare blankly into space.","Evolves into Golduck at Lvl 33","Water"," 2'07\" | 0.8 m"," 43.2 lbs | 19.6 kg"," Damp | Cloud Nine |"," Swift Swim"," Water 1 | Field"," Water 1 | Field","

As a result, they can utilize moves like Confusion and Zen Headbutt—Psychic-type moves—at will, in addition to Water-type moves like Water Pulse. The gems on their heads glow when using their psychic abilities; they were once thought to be imbued with their power, leading them to be overhunted in the past. Golduck are exceptionally fast and graceful swimmers. They may need to relocate to larger lakes and rivers after evolving to give themselves ample room because of this. Using their webbed limbs, they can easily outspeed even the fastest human swimmers, and as such can make quick work of agile fish; they may even use their psychic abilities to disorient and disable their prey before catching them. Surprisingly, Golduck rely heavily on their tails for swimming strength, stamina and maneuverability in addition to their limbs. Golduck can swim for two days straight without rest. They can often be seen gliding agilely through the water at dusk in slower rivers (though they have no trouble with currents). Most scientists believe that Golduck, with their duck-like appearances and crepuscular natures, are the inspiration behind the mythical kappa, a common myth in regions like Kanto and Johto.","Evolves from Psyduck at Lvl 33","Water"," 5'07\" | 1.7 m"," 168.9 lbs | 76.6 kg"," Damp | Cloud Nine |"," Swift Swim"," Water 1 | Field"," Water 1 | Field","

"56","Mankey","056","Forests, jungles, mountains","Mankey are known for their incredibly short tempers. Even the slightest provocation can send them into fits of rage. Their bodies shudder uncontrollably and their nostrils flare up right before they strike. Then, they launch relentless flurries of attacks at their foes before they even get a chance to retaliate or escape. Despite their temperaments, Mankey are very social Pokémon that live in groups in the treetops. If one Mankey is angered, the entire colony will attack. In their huge frenzies, they are unable to tell friend from foe and may even attack one another, becoming even angrier. They are very agile creatures, able to swing in the trees to chase foes. If they lose track of their colonies, they will be infuriated by their own loneliness and attack everything they see. They may pass out from their tantrums, but be so angry in their dreams that they reawaken, and then become further enraged by the interruption. Notably, they enjoy bananas, Chesto Berries, and chestnuts, but their inability to peel the latter greatly enrages them. In Alola, it is said that Mankey live a long time because they never hold in their anger.","Evolves into Primeape at Lvl 28","Fighting"," 1'08\" | 0.5 m"," 61.7 lbs | 28.0 kg"," Vital Spirit | Anger Point |"," Defiant"," Field"," Field","

These Pokémon will become uncontrollably angry if they even sense someone might be looking at them. Running from one will initiate a chase. Primeape will not give up on their targets, chasing them relentlessly and channelling all of their efforts into pursuing their foes until they collapse from exhaustion. They will never forget the face of a foe that angers them, even after beating them down. When enraged, their bodies redirect blood from their brains to their muscles, increasing their strength and endurance, but also clouding their thoughts; Primeape that become too angry may even die from the redirected blood, which may be the only time that they are peaceful. This immediate arousal appears to be an instinctual response; even Primeape awoken from sleep will chase offenders, lethargically but still unyieldingly. Recent studies show that their blood vessels are in fact stronger than those of other Pokémon, allowing them to withstand higher blood pressures without bursting. To the surprise of many, Primeape are exclusively herbivores, eating bananas, Chesto Berries, and chestnuts, like Mankey. Unlike Mankey, however, Primeape are able to simply channel their inner rage against chestnuts to punch them open.","Evolves from Mankey at Lvl 28","Fighting"," 3'03\" | 1.0 m"," 70.5 lbs | 32.0 kg"," Vital Spirit | Anger Point |"," Defiant"," Field"," Field","

Their amazing senses of smell and olfactory memory allow them to never forget scents, helping police officers trace crimes back to their culprits. They roar loudly when they suspect criminals may be near to spook culprits out. In a pinch, they make good lie detectors as well, as Growlithe are abnormally good at sensing human emotions. However, exceptionally strong odors ​may sometimes overpower their sensitive noses and temporarily disable their senses of smell. Growlithe are also extremely loyal, defending their trainers by barking at or biting anyone that appears dangerous. However, they will obey commands unerringly, and will always wait for instructions before attacking. Growlithe are fearless Pokémon that will not back down from even the largest and strongest of enemies. In Alola, these Pokémon commonly will fight for territory with their relatives Rockruff.","﻿Evolves into Arcanine with a Fire Stone","Fire"," 2'04\" | 0.7 m"," 41.9 lbs | 19.0 kg"," Intimidate | Flash Fire |"," Justified"," Field"," Field","

One was said to have been the partner of a mythical general who conquered an entire nation with Arcanine by his side. By the modern definition, though, few would consider them legendary Pokémon at all--this does not mean they are not popular Pokémon, however. Arcanine are said to be able to run over 6,200 miles (10,000 kilometers) in a day. They are thought to look like they are flying when running due to their grace and beauty. Strong fires burn within these Pokémon, allowing them to use many powerful Fire-type moves. Though rare in the wild, Arcanine can occasionally be seen dashing across prairies, gathering food and storing it in their manes to bring back for their young. Their deafening roars can silence enemies. They can also defend themselves with moves such as Extreme Speed. Though they may not be legendaries, Arcanine still command great respect with their awe-striking power.","﻿Evolves from Growlithe with a Fire Stone","Fire"," 6'03\" | 1.9 m"," 341.7 lbs | 155.0 kg"," Intimidate | Flash Fire |"," Justified"," Field"," Field","

"60","Poliwag","060","Ponds and lakes around lily pads","Poliwag are amphibious Pokémon, capable of life both on land and in water. That being said, however, they are much better at swimming in the water with their tails than walking on dry land with their feet; terrestrially, they are very clumsy, often falling and rolling around helplessly. Still, they try to venture onto land in order to strengthen their legs, though they will flee into the water at the first sign of danger. Their skin is so thin that light can pass through it, rendering it transparent. The spirals on their belly, actually their innards, can differ in direction depending on which side of the equator the Poliwag was born; those with clockwise spirals are from the northern hemisphere, while those with counter-clockwise ones are from the southern hemisphere.. Their skin must be kept moist at all times--when not in the water, they are in constant danger of drying out.  As a result, they rarely stray too far from the water’s edge (if they leave it at all). Their thin skin also leaves Poliwag particularly vulnerable to water pollution, which they can easily absorb. Their swirls will pale when they are ill. However, this skin is also very flexible and slippery, bouncing off the fangs and claws of attackers. Poliwag primarily feed on algae and lily pad roots. They are skittish Pokémon that hide from foes amongst aquatic plants.","Evolves into Poliwhirl at Lvl 25​Poliwhirl evolves into Poliwrath with a Water Stone or Politoed through trading with a King's Rock","Water"," 2'00\" | 0.6 m"," 27.3 lbs | 12.4 kg"," Water Absorb | Damp |"," Swift Swim"," Water 1"," Water 1","

Poliwhirl must constantly keep their skin moist. When out of water, they achieve this by sweating a slippery, oily fluid all over their bodies. This substance has the added effect of making Poliwhirl difficult to hold on to in battle, as they can easily slip and slide out of the grasps of opponents. By undulating the spirals on their bellies, Poliwhirl can perform Hypnosis to lull opponents to sleep. This buys ample time for them to escape. Their hands are also developed enough to perform a variety of palm-based moves such as Double Slap and Wake-Up Slap, the latter of which they often use with Hypnosis to bring down particularly bulky foes. Both Poliwhirl and Poliwag are mesmerized and drawn to to the cries of Politoed, and will cease whatever they are doing to locate and congregate around the source of such noises. They have been shown to even respond to audio recordings rather than actual Politoed.","Evolves from Poliwag at Lvl 25Evolves into Poliwrath with a Water Stone or Politoed through trading with a King's Rock","Water"," 3'03\" | 1.0 m"," 44.1 lbs | 20.0 kg"," Water Absorb | Damp |"," Swift Swim"," Water 1"," Water 1","

Unlike their pre-evolutions, Poliwrath prefer land over water. They are still very strong swimmers, however; they can outswim human Olympic swimmers without even tiring. Poliwrath can even briefly run across surfaces of water for brief moments using their strong arms and legs; their bodies are nearly all muscle and no fat. They can swim using similar strokes that humans use, like the butterfly and breaststroke. Different populations seem to have different preferences, though they enjoy teaching others their style. Their muscles are conditioned so that they do not get tired, letting them walk or swim nearly indefinitely. Poliwrath are also more confrontational than Poliwhirl in that they will not shy away from conflicts, though they are by no means aggressive. ","Poliwag evolves into Poliwhirl at Lvl 25Evolves from Poliwhirl with a Water StonePoliwhirl can also evolve into Politoed through trading with a King's Rock","Water/Fighting"," 4'03\" | 1.3 m"," 119.0 lbs | 54.0 kg"," Water Absorb | Damp |"," Swift Swim"," Water 1"," Water 1","

Their only known move is Teleport, and will not hesitate to use it when confronted, teleporting away from potential threats to safety. Trainers must either throw their Poké Balls immediately or prevent their escapes to catch them. Abra are masters of teleportation; they can warp quickly enough so that they appear to be in in multiple places at once. However, this requires great effort and concentration of psychic energy, often tiring them out. As a result, Abra will sleep up to 10 hours a day. If they do not get enough rest, their psychic powers may be weakened. Even when Abra are asleep, their bodies can still sense impending attacks or danger and warp them away without waking up (they may consequently awaken bewildered by their locations as a result). Studies have shown that even when unthreatened, Abra will instinctively teleport about once an hour. Abra can also read the minds of foes, helping them plan out their escapes. According to popular legend, a person can sneak up on an Abra if he or she completely clears his or her mind before approaching, as the Abra will not be able to sense his or her presence.","Evolves into Kadabra at Lvl 16​Kadabra evolves into Alakazam through trade","Psychic"," 2'11\" | 0.9 m"," 43.0 lbs | 19.5 kg"," Synchronize | Inner Focus |"," Magic Guard"," Human-Like"," Human-Like","

Their psychic powers increase with adrenaline, so a Kadabra in danger may be able to perform more powerful attacks than usual. These Pokémon emit strange alpha waves from their brains, which can induce headaches in those around them and cause electronics to malfunction. Only trainers with strong minds can stand to train these Pokémon, as they seem to be less affected by these strange waves. By staring at their silver spoons, they can focus their energy; without one, their strength is halved. Curiously, this only seems to work with silver, with no other metals being of any use to them. A Kadabra’s alpha waves can cause clocks to run backwards and shadows to appear on TVs. These silhouettes are said to bring bad luck to those who see them. When Kadabra focus on their spoons or close their eyes, the strength of their psychic powers increases.

Their huge brains weigh so much that their necks can no longer support them; they must use their psychic powers to support them instead. Older Alazakazam have larger heads. Alakazam can close their eyes to increase their strength. They exude so much psychic energy from their brains that those nearby may develop headaches. Their spoons are thought to have been created purely of this energy, though this has not been proven. An Alazakam can recognize its own spoons from another's, leading some to believe each pair is completely unique. These Pokémon will gift one of their spoons as a sign of utmost affection, and according to folklore anything eaten with a gifted spoon will taste sublime. In battle, Alakazam use their intellects to their advantage. They quickly calculate variables like type advantages, chance of missing, and so on.

Machop practice all styles of martial arts. Using the mountainous terrains in which they dwell to their advantages, they are often seen practicing by hurling Geodude and lifting Graveler that also live in these areas (much to their dismay). If there aren’t any of these Pokémon around, Machop can also make due with similarly-sized boulders. A Machop can lift a sumo wrestler above its head without breaking a sweat. The majority of their body composition is pure muscle, allowing them to perform these amazing feats of strength. They can throw powerful punches and kicks thanks to their constant and relentless training, allowing them to utilize Fighting-type moves such as Karate Chop, Low Kick, Vital Throw, Cross Chop, and even Dynamic Punch.

Machoke have incredible stamina like their pre-evolutions, not tiring even when doing the most strenuous of activities. They are always focused in battle, trying to get the most out of their training sessions. A Machoke’s muscles are as hard as steel; they grow after every battle. Machoke can easily hold sumo wrestlers up with just a single finger, and entire dump trucks with just one hand. These Pokémon enjoy helping people and other Pokémon lift heavy objects, as these tasks are great training for the Machoke themselves.

For example, they may use three of their arms to hold down foes while using the fourth to deliver a punch strong enough to knock them over the horizon (or derail a train, as one infamous incident had proven; luckily, no one was hurt in the accident). Alternatively, they may instead execute a different move with each of their limbs--for example, an uppercut, a hook, a straight, and a karate chop all simultaneously with their four limbs. They can deliver swift, endless volleys of punches to relentlessly pummel down opponents. There is even a special name for a complex grab these Pokémon perform using all four of their arms: \"the Machamp special\".

They are insectivores, capturing their prey by rooting themselves into the ground and camouflaging as plants before lashing out their vines to ensnare small, unwary insects. Their roots also draw water and nutrients from the soil. However, they are unable to run while rooted, making them easy targets for predators while trying to hunt. Bellsprout are quick at capturing prey, dissolving victims with acid from their mouths strong enough to melt through iron. Their flexible bodies allow them to swerve around most attacks, giving them time to uproot themselves from the soil and escape from attackers. Their flexibility is the reasoning behind the name of the Sprout Tower in Johto. The pillar in the middle of the tower sways gently from side to side like a Bellsprout’s stalk. A popular legend in Johto says that at one time, the pillar was in fact a giant, 100-foot tall Bellsprout that eventually became the swaying pillar that holds up Sprout Tower.","Evolves into Weepinbell at Lvl 21​Weepinbell evolves into Victreebel with a Leaf Stone","","Grass","/Poison",""," 2'04\" | 0.7 m"," Chlorophyll |"," Chlorophyll |","

Weepinbell must protect themselves from their own acid by also secreting neutralizing fluids so that they don’t dissolve their own bodies. When resting, they hang from tree branches using the small hooks behind their heads. Tropical trees with clear acid burns on their bark were likely inhabited by colonies of Weepinbell at some point in time. Occasionally, Weepinbell may fall from their trees in their sleep. This is a huge danger for these Pokémon, as they become vulnerable to predators (and to capture by humans) in this state. However, in a colony, a fallen Weepinbell is still extremely dangerous to approach, as the other Weepinbell still hanging from the tree will be ready to attack with sprays of acid.","Evolves from Bellsprout at Lvl 21Evolves into Victreebel with a Leaf Stone","Grass","/Poison"," 3'03\" | 1.0 m"," 14.1 lbs | 6.4 kg"," Chlorophyll |"," Grass"," Grass","

Then, their acid, which smells like honey, brings their targets right to the Pokémon. Victreebel then swallow their victims whole, digesting them with their powerful acids. As they dissolve more prey, their ​acid’s smell grows even sweeter and more honey-like, attracting more prey and continuing the cycle.  As stone-evolved Pokémon, Victreebel are rather rare in the wild and are generally only found in the previously-mentioned colonies, rarely straying into the fringes of their forests.

They can often be found drifting with the waves in shallow waters, stinging anything that provokes them with their tentacles. They also uses these tentacles to feel about; however, they are unable to retract their stinging cells, so they often unintentionally sting things they are examining. These tentacles sometimes break off, but will grow back with time. As their bodies are 99% composed water, they will quickly dry out and shrivel up if washed ashore; the other 1% percent is their venom-producing organ. They can be revived by being tossed back into the sea. Their high water content also gives them a rather peculiar ability--Tentacool can refract sunlight and concentrate it into the crystals on their heads to fire strange beams of energy at foes.

Then, they constrict their victims, stinging and weakening them by injecting venom. Tentacruel then return back to the rock formations on the sea floor that they call home, carrying their meals with them. If a Tentacruel is having a particularly rough time finding something to eat, its orbs will flash. These Pokémon can emit ultrasonic blasts from their crystals to disturb the surrounding water and scare out prey. Additionally, they can also flash these crystals to alert surrounding Tentacruel of approaching danger. When conditions are right, many Tentacruel will suddenly congregate and clear an area of all fish. Their tentacles do not regrow, so older individuals tend to have fewer of them.","Evolves from Tentacool at Lvl 30","Water","/Poison"," 5'03\" | 1.6 m"," 121.3 lbs | 55.5 kg"," Clear Body | Liquid Ooze |"," Water 3"," Water 3","

"74","Geodude","074","Mountains, caves","Geodude are extremely common Pokémon in rocky places, sometimes representing nearly half of the total Pokémon in the area. They can almost perfectly disguise themselves as normal stones and hide in plain sight, spending most of their time like this. Geodude bury themselves halfway into the dirt to sleep; if stepped on, they may not even stir. However, awakening a sleeping Geodude may anger it and cause it to swing its fists at the assailer. They roll down mountainsides in search of food. Once satisfied, they hoist themselves back up with their arms in slow ascents. As Geodude age, their rough bodies begin to smoothen as their daily rolls chip away at their exteriors. The oldest Geodude may even have completely smooth bodies; such individuals tend to be calmer and less ornery than their younger relatives as well. They are prideful of the toughness of their bodies; two Geodude will slam against each other to see which has the harder exterior. They are occasionally thrown about by other mountain Pokémon such as Machop when mistaken for rocks, but their sturdy bodies can handle the roughhousing. In snowy weather, some people even mistake sleeping, snow-covered Geodude for snowballs.","﻿Evolves into Graveler at Lvl 25Graveler evolves into Golem through tradeAlso see Alolan Geodude","Rock/Ground"," 1'04\" | 0.4 m"," 44.1 lbs | 20.0 kg"," Rock Head | Sturdy |"," Sand Veil"," Mineral"," Mineral","

"75","Graveler","075","Mountains, caves","Though Graveler are carefree and not at all aggressive Pokémon, they are one of the main dangers trainers face while hiking in the mountains. The main hazard with Graveler is that they roll down mountainsides carelessly (as they are very slow walkers), smashing trees, boulders, and anything else standing in the way--including unwary travelers--until they reach the bottom. If they land into a river, they may even explode upon contact. They are very difficult to stop once they pick up momentum from their tumbles, and can appear almost out of nowhere due to the high speeds they can reach. The best way to avoid rolling Graveler is to stay alert. If one hears rumbling in the distance on a mountain, one should try to locate its source and steer clear of the direct line below it. Graveler actively enjoy rolling down mountains and will climb to their peaks simply to tumble back down. Sometimes, these Pokémon may lose chunks of their bodies due to the rough terrains they roll on (though they do slowly regenerate); the broken chunks may fly off as debris, so one must make sure to take cover as well. When not rolling down mountains, Graveler consume rocks, especially enjoying those covered in moss.","﻿Evolves from Geodude at Lvl 25Evolves into Golem through tradeAlso see Alolan Graveler","Rock/Ground"," 3'03\" | 1.0 m"," 231.5 lbs | 105.0 kg"," Rock Head | Sturdy |"," Sand Veil"," Mineral"," Mineral","

"76","Golem","076","Mountains, caves","Golem are rarities in the wild, so (luckily) it is rare to see one tumbling down a mountainside. They are still very dangerous to be near, though, because they often use Explosion to propel themselves from mountain to mountain. Such explosions can set off rockslides in the immediate vicinity. Their hides are strong enough to withstand dynamite blasts. Golem shed their skins annually to grow larger; their shells almost immediately crumble away into the soil, enriching it. Farmers strive to collect shed Golem pelts as a result. Their bodies are whitish and tender for a short period of time, but new shells will quickly harden upon contact with the air. However, Golem eventually stop shedding with age, and particularly old individuals may even start growing moss on their carapaces after some time. Earthquakes will sometimes send groups of Golem rolling down, endangering alpine homes. To protect these structures, grooves are often dug in the sides of mountains to redirect the paths of spooked Golem (and careless Graveler as well). When Golem roll, they tuck in their limbs and heads, rendering them temporarily unable to see. A rolling Golem may cause a small earthquake due to its weight, triggering others to roll as well.","﻿Geodude evolves into Graveler at Lvl 25Evolves from Graveler through trade​Also see Alolan Golem","Rock/Ground"," 4'07\" | 1.4 m"," 661.4 lbs | 300.0 kg"," Rock Head | Sturdy |"," Sand Veil"," Mineral"," Mineral","

However, as they gallops along with their parents and jump over tall grass, their legs gradually becomes stronger. Eventually, they becomes one of the best jumpers in the world, able to clear nearly 3,000 feet (1 kilometer) in a single bound. Their hooves are harder than diamond, allowing them to flatten practically anything they trample over. These sturdy hooves absorb the impact from their enormous jumps. Ponyta are born flameless, but their fire emerges as soon as an hour after ​birth. They defend themselves using both their hooves and their flames, rearing their legs to kick targets behind them and attacking those in front with moves like Flame Wheel. Ponyta can only be ridden by those that they trust; if strangers attempt to mount them, they can burn them with fire. Curiously, their flames never dissipate. Though Ponyta can control the temperatures of their flames, they cannot make them disappear. This odd ability is currently the subject of intensive study.","﻿Evolves into Rapidash at Lvl 40Also see Galarian Ponyta","Fire"," 3'03\" | 1.0 m"," 66.1 lbs | 30.0 kg"," Run Away | Flash Fire |"," Flame Body"," Field"," Field","

Rapidash greatly enjoy being challenged. When they sees anything moving quickly, even man-made objects like trains and cars, they will race alongside it and attempt to out-speed it. They can reach their top speeds in as little as ten steps, appearing as blazing trails of fire to onlookers. These flames flare up and become larger the faster Rapidash run. At full speed, their manes appear to sparkle. Like their pre-evolutions, their flames only burn those that they distrust or are angered by. However, many people prefer riding Rapidash over Ponyta because they are less skittish when faced with unexpected obstacles. Rapidash can use their horns, in addition to their Fire-type attacks and powerful hooves, to defend themselves with moves such as Megahorn.

To catch food, Slowpoke dangle their tails lazily from the shore into the sea. They secrete a sweet substance that attracts fish. However, due to their daftness, they sometimes forget why they were even near the water in the first place. It can take them up to a day to process bites on their tails. Slowpoke tails are regarded to be very delicious. They shed and regrow their tails periodically; the shed appendages are harvested and dried for cooking. Cutting the tails of live Slowpoke is strictly forbidden and can be punished severely. Some believe fresh tails are more potent, though, and they are sadly a common product on the black market. Slowpoke Well in Azalea Town, Johto is a man-made well that many Slowpoke call home. Residents keep them as local pets of sorts.

If they are sufficiently grown, these catches will catalyze their evolutions into Slowbro. The Shellder attached to Slowbro grow with them as well, taking on spiral shapes. The added weight force Slowbro to become bipedal. Shellder poison also completely numbs their pain receptors.  These Shellder almost parasitize Slowbro, drawing energy from their delicious tails and feeding on leftover scraps. Because they will not come off in any way (save from being thrown off in particularly rough battles, at ​which point the Slowbro will resume life as larger Slowpoke), Slowbro are no longer able to fish with their tails and must, to their disdain, swim to catch food. They retain their dim intellects even after evolution. However, on occasions, the Shellder may bite down and send more poison into their hosts’ brains, and as a strange result, cause them to become briefly enlightened; their Psychic-type attacks will be strengthened as well when this occurs.","Evolves from Slowpoke at Lvl 37Slowpoke can also evolve into Slowking through trade with a King's RockCan Mega Evolve into Mega Slowbro","Water","/","Psychic"," 5'03\" | 1.6 m"," 173.1 lbs | 78.5 kg"," Regenerator"," Regenerator","

"81","Magnemite","081","Power plants, rocky areas near metal ore","Though Magnemite look like artificial beings, they have actually been around for over 1,000 years, as ancient carvings depicting them have been found in the Ruins of Alph. Magnemite float using electromagnetic energy, which they generate by spinning the units on their sides; the faster they rotate, the more energy they generate. Touching them as they spin can give a nasty shock. They cannot float without this spinning—if somehow drained of their electrical energy, they will fall straight to the ground. Magnemite tend to ignore humans, but are attracted to electronic devices because they feed on electricity. As a result they often congregate around trainers using Pokédexes or other devices, potentially causing them to malfunction. They also may cling to power lines and towers in urban areas, causing small power outages. Some studies show that Magnemite attacks on power plants have become more frequent in the last 50 years, possibly because an increase in buried power-lines have forced them to find more exposed electrical sources. For this reason, modern power plants may pulse deterrent electrical signals to keep them at bay. Magnemite generally defend themselves with non-damaging attacks like Thunder Wave and Metal Sound. They will not hesitate, however, to use other moves such as Thunderbolt and Magnet Bomb if necessary.","Evolves into Magneton at Lvl 30Magneton evolves into Magnezone when leveled up in an area of magnetic activity","Electric","/","Steel"," 1'00\" | 0.3 m"," 13.2 lbs | 6.0 kg"," Analytic"," Analytic","

Their brains fuse in this process, though contrary to popular belief, they do not become three times smarter. Magneton generate radio waves that can raise heat the air within 3,300 feet (1,000 meters) by 3.6°F (2°C), dry all surrounding moisture, and cause earaches in those nearby. They seem to appear more frequently when there are more sunspots on the sun, a correlation that researchers have not found an explanation for. Magneton can irreparably damage electronics simply by being near them. For that reason, many cities near their habitats will issue warnings or sound alarms when swarms of them approach (luckily, their relationship with sunspots make them easy to predict). They will also congregate in areas where lighting is about to strike in hopes of being hit.

They protect the fields in which these plants grow with their lives, and will often fight with each other for choice stalks. Their wings have adapted to be more finger-like to enable them to grasp leeks, though some prefer hold them in their beaks instead. Farfetch’d are extremely endangered, as they are said to be very delicious, especially cooked with the very stalks they hold. Because of this, there are large efforts to breed these Pokémon to prevent them from going extinct. In dire emergencies, Farfetch’d may actually eat their own leeks. They will begin search endlessly for new ones immediately afterwards, however. Their stalks enable them to use moves such as Night Slash, False Swipe, and Aerial Ace; different fighting styles have been observed in different regions. Farfetch’d are surprisingly adept in water, thanks to their webbed feet, and can sometimes be found swimming in ponds.","Also see Galarian Farfetch'd","","Normal/Flying",""," 2'07\" | 0.8 m"," 33.1 lbs | 15.0 kg"," Defiant"," Defiant","

While sprinting, they may leave footprints in the dirt as deep as 4 inches (10 centimeters). Doduo alternately bob their heads to keep balance while running. Their two heads have identical brains (though a few with differing ones have been discovered on occasion) and can communicate ​with each other through telepathy in order to accomplish common goals. The two heads take turns sleeping; while one dozes off, the other keeps watch for any potential dangers approaching. This team effort makes it difficult to catch Doduo off-guard. To defend themselves, Doduo can attack with moves such as Double Hit and Drill Peck.

However, they may occasionally over-exhaust themselves with this, and will remain motionless for extended periods of time while recovering. Their heads do argue sometimes, since the emotions they control tend to disagree. However, like many internal conflicts, these inner spats are usually solved with food. Since they share the same stomach, when one of the heads eats, the other two will be satisfied as well.

Seel are actually more active the colder the surrounding water is. Conversely, they get tired more easily in warm waters; this makes their appearance in the Alola region a mystery, though some scientists hypothesize that the islands may be along a Seel migration route. Their light-blue fur (which appears white) and layers of blubber insulate them from the harsh cold. Seel are vespertine Pokémon that are most active in the evening. Sometimes, one may see a Seel napping near the shoreline in the morning. When hunting, they dive underwater for extended periods of time. When they need to breathe, they surface and break through sea ice with their horns (and tusks if necessary). When Seel swim, they close their nostrils tightly to block out water. They are highly social Pokémon, living in large, raucous groups on ice floes in the middle of the sea. Seel may play-fight with each other on these floes, sparring with their tusks and horns as well as Water-type and sometimes Ice-type attacks. This activity is important in teaching young Seel how to defend themselves against enemies.","Evolves into Dewgong at Lvl 34","Water"," 3'07\" | 1.1 m"," 198.4 lbs | 90.0 kg"," Thick Fat | Hydration |"," Ice Body"," Water 1 | Field"," Water 1 | Field","

When resting, though they do still sometimes sleep on the ocean floor or shore like Seel, they now prefer to rest on ice floes. Recent studies show that they are in fact sunbathing while doing so, with the increased temperature aiding their digestion. There, their pristine white fur can camouflage them against predators. It is believed that these sleeping Dewgong were the source of myths about mermaids, perpetrated by tired sailors on the cold seas. Dewgong are only slightly more adept on land than Seel, and as such still prefer to stay in the water. Their bodies are streamlined to minimize drag while swimming, and their long tails enable them to turn on a dime. Their fur and blubber can store thermal energy, insulating them against the bitter cold. Dewgong no longer use their tusks and horns to play-fight, since they stop growing at this stage.

It is far more likely, though, that they emerged from polluted waterways filled with radioactive industrial waste. In a freak accident of nature, Grimer emerged, breeding and multiplying quickly. Grimer feed on toxic sludge and can squeeze their gel-like bodies through almost any opening to get to it, often infiltrating sewage pipes and occasionally clogging them up if present in larger numbers. Their putrid smell is indicative of cities with polluted waterways; Celadon City, Kanto, for example, is home to reports of Grimer splashing about in public fountains. Wherever Grimer go, their toxins kill flora upon contact and prevent anything else from growing there. Additionally, they can reproduce in the wild asexually; bits of them may drip off as they travel to form new Grimer. Grimer will die if their bacterial sludge is purified; new urban sanitation methods have recently decreased their numbers.","Evolves into Muk at Lvl 38Also see Alolan Grimer","Poison"," 2'11\" | 0.9 m"," 66.1 lbs | 30.0 kg"," Stench | Sticky Hold |"," Poison Touch"," Amorphous"," Amorphous","

Muk trails are inhospitable to life and kill plants on contact. They can transmit many infectious (but luckily, rarely fatal) diseases if touched. Muk are less dense than water, so lakes with many of them may appear to be covered in sludge. Thankfully, Muk learn to control their poisons after evolving and can peacefully coexist with others (who can tolerate their smell).

They can also lampoon prey with Icicle Spear. While their shells are harder than diamond, their insides are very delicate. Coastal tribes once used their shells to fashion shields. They can inject a numbing poison by clamping down on foes, but they leave their heads vulnerable when doing so. Shellder can form beautiful pearls from sand trapped in their shells, which can be sold for large sums of money; some people raise Shellder solely for this reason. Because these pearls obstruct their vision and feeding, these Pokémon conveniently will spit them out once formed. Shellder enjoy eating Slowpoke tail secretions and will bite these tails on sight. They then adopt a spiral shape and inject poison as the Slowpoke evolve into Slowbro. They are also oddly attracted to King’s Rocks.

Cloyster are capable of swimming by swallowing water and jetting it out—this is the same process they use to shoot spikes. They can slam their shells shut with incredible force. Unlike Shellder, Cloyster can use clamping as a viable method of defense. Their insides are virtually untouchable while their shells are closed. Even the strongest forces cannot pry a clamped Cloyster apart; consequently, no one knows exactly what lies within their shells. It has been recently discovered that Cloyster that live in stronger currents have larger spikes, though the reason behind this is unknown.

However, they also allow them to be blown away by strong winds. To protect themselves, Gastly hide in abandoned buildings or under the eaves of houses. They capture prey by enveloping them in their poisonous gas, which can seep through skin and cause fainting. They may also immobilize prey with the paralyzing move Lick. Despite their poor reputation, though, Gastly are not blatantly malicious and do not “haunt” beings with the intent of harming them. Instead, they are mischievous pranksters who enjoy startling others. They rarely utilize their poisonous gases unless threatened, but are known to put victims to sleep with Hypnosis. Their pranks can be annoying at times, so it should be noted that oscillating fans are very effective at warding Gastly away because the Pokémon steer clear of strong winds.

Haunter can also feed on fear. Though research has shown that such a diet is not very energy-efficient, it is believed that some Haunter have learned to feed on these feelings because they are “sustainable;” by not killing victims, some Haunter have successfully used cities as “farms” of sorts, scaring people as necessary and feeding on their fright. Many ghost “hot-spots” are in fact popular Haunter feeding grounds. Since Haunter detest light, well-lit towns are usually devoid of them.

Gengar are also said to attack those who are hopelessly lost and afraid in the mountains. Many Gengar have learned to feed on fear, simply following victims in the shadows and mimicking them almost, but not quite perfectly. This cultivates great paranoia in victims, which they can then feast on. Other tricks Gengar have been known to use include: laughing maniacally in the shadows, lighting their red eyes in the darkness, and chanting mysteriously in the distance.

For this reason, they can sometimes be found lurking outside daycares or kindergartens during naptime. They are also skilled in hypnotism, putting people and Pokémon to sleep to consume their dreams. There are many “signs” people believe Drowzee leave after eating dreams. For example, an itchy nose upon waking may mean one has sucked up a dream through your nostrils, or having a good dream but not remembering it means that it has been consumed. Drowzee (save for trained ones) rarely live near people, however, preferring to feed on the dreams of Pokémon in the grasslands that they call home.

"97","Hypno","097","Grasslands, savannas, forests, rainforests","Just the mention of Hypno will strike fear in any parent’s heart. Tales of Hypno hypnotizing and kidnapping children run rampant. One particular story that made headlines was that of the young girl Lostelle, who was hypnotized by a Hypno and taken to Berry Forest on Kin Island in the Sevii Islands, where the Pokémon proceeded to feast on her dreams. It took a daring young trainer to defeat the Hypno and rescue her. Luckily, Hypno only prey on dreams, so captives generally return physically unharmed. Their swinging pendulums cause drowsiness even in onlookers that have just awoken. The longer one stares at the mesmerizing oscillations, the longer the effect last. Hypno polish their pendulums constantly with their manes. Many parents warn their children to shut their eyes or look away if they run into Hypno; however, this is more easily said than done. The swinging of a Hypno’s pendulum transfixes all that see it. As a result, it oftentimes takes an outside force, such as another person, to push victims away. However, trained Hypno are of great use to doctors to help treat insomnia in patients. Oddly, in the Alola region, wild Hypno rarely attack humans because of the presence of the permanently-sleeping Komala as much easier targets.","Evolves from Drowzee at Lvl 26","Psychic"," 5'03\" | 1.6 m"," 166.7 lbs | 75.6 kg"," Insomnia | Forewarn | ​Inner Focus"," Human-Like","Habitat","Habitat","

"98","Krabby","098","Sandy beaches, estuaries","Krabby dwell on sandy beaches and in muddy estuaries, digging into the sand so that they are not washed away by the waves. They are scavengers, feeding on whatever the tides bring in. If food is scarce, they may even eat sand to obtain nutrients. This can lead to fierce fights between Krabby over land, battling with moves like Vice Grip and Crabhammer. If their claws break off during battle, they can regrow stronger ones to replace them. They use their claws to balance while walking sideways, so they cannot move properly when missing one. Krabby are hardy Pokémon that can live near water of various salinities and pollution levels. They grow by molting their exoskeletons. By absorbing seawater and expanding themselves slightly, they loosen their old shells and cast them off. It takes a few days for their new shell to harden. During these periods, they will hide in their burrows to protect themselves. Krabby can spew foam from their mouths when threatened to cover their bodies and make themselves appear larger.","Evolves into Kingler at Lvl 28","Water"," 1'04\" | 0.4 m"," 14.3 lbs | 6.5 kg"," Hyper Cutter | Shell Armor | ​Sheer Force"," Water 3","Habitat","Habitat","

"99","Kingler","099","Sandy beaches, estuaries","The defining characteristic of Kingler is how one of their claws is significantly larger than the other. These “super-claws” are as hard as iron, but unfortunately are just as heavy. They can exert crushing forces of 10,000 horsepower, but due to their weights, are extremely unwieldy to use in battle. If Kingler attempt to move them too quickly, they may lose balance and stumble. However, due to their sheer power, only a single blow needs to connect to defeat most foes. Out of battle, these large claw aren’t very efficient for most everyday tasks, so they tends to use their smaller ones instead. When signaling to fellow Kingler or competing for dominance, however, they will wave their larger claws wildly in the air (a very tiring action for them). In battle, Kingler use their massive claws to execute Vice Grip, Crabhammer, and even Guillotine. While their armor are steel-hard, though, their exoskeletons do have a chink, which can be revealed by flipping them over onto their backs. This “weak spot” can be attacked to easily defeat them.","Evolves from Krabby at Lvl 28Certain Kingler can Gigantamax into Gigantamax Kingler","Water"," 4'03\" | 1.3 m"," 132.3 lbs | 60.0 kg"," Hyper Cutter | Shell Armor | ​Sheer Force"," Water 3","Habitat","Habitat","

"100","Voltorb","100","Power plants, areas with electrical activity","Voltorb are mysterious Pokémon, first appearing with the advent of mass-producing Poké Ball factories. They rather uncannily resembles large Poké Balls themselves. Many trainers have mistaken Voltorb or their evolutions Electrode for them from afar. However, Voltorb are prone to screeching, shocking or exploding at the slightest provocation, especially when someone draws too near. Their preferred form of locomotion is rolling, but if they hit bumps, they will also explode. Voltorb draw energy from sources of electricity, such as the trolleys of electric trains or generators. However, if they draw too much energy at once, they will overload and, unsurprisingly, blow up. These volatile Pokémon have been discovered to contain very few naturally-occurring components, leading scientists to believe that they may have stemmed from sort of manmade experiment involving Poké Balls. Something may have went wrong during the experiment, explaining their tendencies to self-destruct so easily.","Evolves into Electrode at Lvl 30","Electric"," 1'08\" | 0.5 m"," 22.9 lbs | 10.4 kg"," Soundproof | Static | ​Aftermath"," Mineral","Habitat","Habitat","

Electrode store high amounts of electrical energy within themselves, and like Voltorb, will let it out in huge explosions at the slightest provocation--only an Electrode’s blast is much larger and more powerful. They feed on electrical energy in the atmosphere or directly from generators. Groups of them at power plants have been known to cause blackouts. Sometimes, if they bloat themselves on electricity, they will drift through the air like floating, explosive balloons. When lightning strikes, a large number ​of them may detonate at once from the overload of electricity. These Pokémon don’t always even need stimuli; sometimes, bored Electrode may explode just to amuse themselves. “Bomb Balls,” as they are nicknamed (for obvious reasons) can also generate their own electricity to provide power. As long as the equipment is shielded and the Electrode are not bothered, this is a useful way for them to release some of their excess energy.","Evolves from Voltorb at Lvl 30","Electric"," 3'11\" | 1.2 m"," 146.8 lbs | 66.6 kg"," Soundproof | Static | ​Aftermath"," Mineral","Habitat","Habitat","

"102","Exeggcute","102","Forests, tropical jungles","While they may superficially resemble eggs, Exeggcute are actually more like seeds. They always must be in groups of 6 to maintain balance; lone Exeggcute will quickly be joined by five others almost immediately. They can communicate with each other telepathically. If one member of a pack is threatened, the others will swarm the attacker to defend it. They use their psychic abilities to fend from predators like Crabrawler. Some of their shells may crack as they travel. However, they are surprisingly durable Pokémon that can survive with cracked or broken shells with little problem. In fact, as these Pokémon approach evolution, these cracks become more and more common. These groups of a half-dozen each are considered one Pokémon—they all can be caught in one Poké Ball, count as one Pokémon in battle, and so forth, in part due to their “shared” minds. Since they get distressed if they are unable to have six members, it is considered abuse to force Exeggcute in groups of more or less. Exeggcute in the Alola region are much heavier for their size, likely because they are stuffed with nutrients.","Evolves into Exeggutor with a Leaf Stone in most regions or Alolan Exeggutor with a Leaf Stone in Alola","Grass","/","Psychic"," 1'04\" | 0.4 m"," 5.5 lbs | 2.5 kg"," Harvest"," Harvest","

These Pokémon live in large herds. When they migrate, it appears as if entire forests are uprooting and moving themselves. This gives them the nickname “The Walking Forests”. Their three heads each speak their minds all at once. As a result, Exeggutor can be very noisy at times. They use telepathy to plan amongst themselves before acting. They are very friendly, both between their heads and to others, so it is rare for them to ever argue. When they do, however, Exeggutor will become confused, especially if they try to move in different directions at once. On occasion, ahead of an Exeggutor may fall off. When this occurs, it becomes an Exeggcute and will emit a telepathic call almost immediately to attract five other Exeggcute and become a group. Though not aggressive, Exeggutor are capable of defending themselves when attacked with a variety of moves, including techniques such as Egg Bomb and the rare Barrage. Focusing on the same target with all three ends results in a triple-strength attack. They are rarely threatened, though, as their herds give them strength in numbers; few ever want to anger entire “forests.”","Evolves from Exeggcute with a Leaf Stone​Also see Alolan Exeggutor","Grass","/","Psychic"," 6'07\" | 2.0 m"," 264.6 lbs | 120.0 kg"," Harvest"," Harvest","

In a tribe of Marowak, the bones of ancestors are kept and treasured as heirlooms, passed on through generations. When born, Cubone do not see their mothers, as they are abandoned in the wild. They are born with closed eyes far away from their tribes, with only a bone (usually a femur) and a skull to protect themselves. They then simply wander aimlessly, wearing the skulls as helmets and using the bones as weapons. It is commonly believed that these bones are the remains of the their mothers, though this is not always true. Most Cubone are traumatized by abandonment, crying mournfully into their skulls to create a rattling sound (which can attract preying Mandibuzz). They often look up on nights of full moons and cry. They are antisocial Pokémon; since they are so isolated, they do not know how to interact with others. It is said that Cubone evolve when they learn to embrace their loneliness.","﻿Evolves into Marowak at Lvl 28 in most regions or Alolan Marowak at Lvl 28 during the night in Alola","Ground"," 1'04\" | 0.4 m"," 14.3 lbs | 6.5 kg"," Rock Head | Lightning Rod  |"," Battle Armor"," Monster"," Monster","

They use bones to defeat foes with moves like Bone Club and Bonemerang. Marowak possess homing instincts that lead them back to to their mothers’ tribes. They will join these tribes, never learning who their mothers truly were. Their loneliness has hardened them towards all deep social connections. Marowak will often fight one another in these tribes to the death for especially prized bones. The loser’s remains will supply tools for future Cubone. The abandonment of young is a coming-of-age for Marowak. Lone Cubone, though traumatized, return home as cold, ruthless fighters who have no qualms whatsoever about brutally beating or killing others. Marowak hardly even communicate with each other, and even more rarely do so with speech. They tap their bones on boulders in specific rhythms to send messages. There are known to be over 50 of these unique rhythms. These Pokémon despise Mandibuzz, who try to steal their prized bones, and will throw their bones at them to knock them out of the sky. In popular folklore where Cubone are believed to be wearing the skulls of their mothers, Marowak are spurred on to defend their bones by their desire to avenge their deceased parent.","﻿Evolves from Cubone at Lvl 28​Also see Alolan Marowak","Ground"," 3'03\" | 1.0 m"," 99.2 lbs | 45.0 kg"," Rock Head | Lightning Rod  |"," Battle Armor"," Monster"," Monster","

They can extend great distances outward to surprise foes with their long ranges. When Hitmonlee kick, their soles become harder than diamond upon impact. They have a great sense of balance; in combination with their incredibly limber legs, They can kick foes successively and powerfully from any position. Their legs also allow them to run smoothly, lengthening and progressively increasing the distance covered by their strides as they sprint. After tough training sessions, Hitmonlee will often massage their legs to prevent fatigue.

However, Hitmonchan are determined, having the spirit of champion boxers, and will not give up no matter what. Even during these breaks, Hitmonchan will often move around or jog quickly in place. They punch in a corkscrew fashion, with enough ​force to pulverize concrete. Even slight grazes from their blows can cause mild burns. They are also skilled in sparring with light punches, allowing them to act as a sparring partners to fellow Hitmonchan or to aspiring human boxers (the latter of which who almost always lose, but learn from fights nonetheless).

When they come across unfamiliar objects, they will lick them, as they associate things by texture and taste. Lickitung do not enjoy sourness, however, and will avoid things that are tart. When their tongues extend, their tails retract; the two organs are connected by a single muscle system. Lickitung saliva causes a tingling sensation upon contact. When threatened, Lickitung can also secrete a substance that mixes with their sticky saliva and paralyzes upon contact. This substance also causes people to break out into a rash if not quickly cleaned. Though Lickitung often chase down people and Pokémon, they are not aggressive.

In warmer climates, such as near volcanoes, the gases in their bodies can expand, stretching their skin and making them prone to exploding. Koffing also tend to produce more gas when warm, making detonations all the more likely. Their gaseous mixtures are lighter than air, allowing them to float. Koffing can also expel these gases when threatened, inducing teary eyes, stuffy noses, and coughing in those exposed to even the most minute amounts. They can also poison attackers with Poison Gas, and of course, use Explosion as well. The gases Koffing expel become smellier and more toxic when they are stressed. Their explosive tendencies essentially make them dangerous, floating mines. In cities where they are plentiful, Koffing can create dangerous smog that shrouds the metropolises.

Each of their heads contains a different poisonous gas. By inflating their heads in an alternating manner, they mix their gases together to form stinkier, more dangerous compounds. They can also worsen the smell and toxicity of their gases by inhaling fumes from industrial waste or absorbing the dust, gases, and germs from garbage. Weezing will make ​their homes in dirty houses, hiding in attics until the residents leave or fall asleep, at which point they will emerge to feast on their garbage.

They will often charge at something but forget why they began charging in the first place mid-run; they will not stop running until they tire out and collapse from exhaustion, however. Sometimes, destroying things help Rhyhorn remember why they began running. Their short feet make it difficult for them to turn, so they can only run in straight lines. Thus, they tend to be very easy to dodge. Oftentimes, they will not even register pain from their collisions until the next day.

Their drill-like horns can bore through boulders and even solid diamond, and sweeps from their tails can destroy buildings. Rhydon armor can withstand nearly anything, including forces as strong as cannon blasts. However, their armor also renders them insensitive to most physical sensations, including pain, as a result. Consequently, they will often unwittingly injure themselves. Notably, though their near-impervious armor does not protect them from water, its thickness prevents their pain receptors from activating in response to getting wet until the Pokémon are already drenched.

Specialty glass specifically designed to prevent Goldeen and Seaking from escaping is available, but very costly; only professionals should uptake the hobby (the Cerulean Gym aquarium in Kanto, for example, is a popular destination to see them). In the wild, Goldeen will compete to see who have the largest and strongest horns. Goldeen prefer large bodies of water—another reason why hobbyists should not keep them in tanks—and will swim down streams in search of larger lakes or rivers.

They can also flash their gems in a single color, alternating between different shades as if sending coded messages. Starmie swim by spinning themselves like propellers through the water. There are many myths purporting that Starmie in fact have extraterrestrial origins, due to their strong connections with the stars along with their strange radial symmetry. Many believe that when Starmie pulse light from their cores into the sky at night, they are actually beaming radio waves into outer space to wherever they came from. Others think they sprung from the reflections of stars on the ocean’s surface. Though recent studies have shown weak radio waves emanating from these Pokémon's gems, most other claims are unsupported by any scientific evidence whatsoever, and Starmie, despite popular myths, more than likely originated here on this planet. Oddly, some people have reported developing headaches when approaching these Pokémon. Unfortunately, Starmie poaching has been on the rise in recent years, with their gems being highly valued on the black market for jewelry.","Evolves from Staryu with a Water Stone","","Water","/","Psychic"," 3'07\" | 1.1 m"," Illuminate | Natural Cure |"," Illuminate | Natural Cure |","

They can often be seen performing in the streets of cities and towns, where they mime in exchange for food. Mr. Mime are exceptionally adept at creating false walls, pretending to be trapped behind invisible barriers using their hands. However, they have the ability to solidify these walls with a peculiar force emitted from their fingertips, all the while keeping them transparent. Their fingers can vibrate, slow, and then stop air, creating completely invisible walls. They can also use this ability to execute moves such as Barrier, Reflect, Light ​Screen, Safeguard, Wide Guard, and Quick Guard, all of which protect them from various attacks in battle. Mr. Mime can also pantomime other objects, such as doors, stairs, and even automobiles. Believing in these “false” objects can in fact make them become real and tangible, albeit not visible. Interrupting a performing Mr. Mime is extremely rude and taboo; they will not hesitate to discipline troublemakers by using Double Slap. Scientists believe that in the past, Mr. Mime had smaller hands than they do now, and that they in fact evolved larger hands in order to more efficiently pantomime.","Evolves from Mime Jr. when leveled while knowing Mimic​Also see Galarian Mr. Mime","Psychic","/Fairy"," 4'03\" | 1.3 m"," 120.1 lbs | 54.5 kg"," Soundproof | Filter |"," Human-Like"," Human-Like","

They are very aggressive, but intelligent Pokémon. Scyther silently stalk their prey, camouflaging in trees or grasses before leaping out with ninja-like speed and slashing their targets to bits with their blades. They attack so quickly that their movements cannot be seen; they can appear to be in multiple places at once as they dart about. They use this to their advantages while hunting. If Scyther are spotted by their quarries, they will dash around them using Double Team to bewilder them. Their blades are sharp enough to slice through logs like butter. Scyther often sharpen them against boulders, and will use them to cut meat into more manageable pieces before eating. Scyther can also fly, though they rarely actually choose to do so. These Pokémon are especially popular in the Alola region. Leaders of Scyther packs command respect from the others members. However, their positions can be challenged at any time in battles. If a leader loses, it is exiled from the group to wander alone. These exiled Scyther generally tend to be more aggressive than those found in packs.","Evolves into Scizor through trade with a Metal Coat","Bug/Flying"," 4'11\" | 1.5 m"," 123.5 lbs | 56.0 kg"," Swarm | Technician |"," Steadfast"," Bug"," Bug","

As Jynx walk, they sway their hips alluringly. Depending on their emotions, they may move in slightly different manners. Their strange movements compel those who see them to move with them, dancing in unison. Those moving may not even realize they are swaying their hips until someone else (who is probably also dancing) points it out to them. Jynx use their dancing to “talk” to one another. However, they also have a form of oral speech, which sounds ​uncannily similar to a foreign human language. For this reason, some musicians have written songs specifically for Jynx to sing. Despite their curious behavior, Jynx are kind Pokémon. As they walk and sway, people and Pokémon alike subconsciously follow them. During blizzards, they will often lead these hypnotized beings to safety away from the cold. Then, they disappear almost as quickly as they appeared.

They may occasionally wander into towns searching for food. This can also cause problems, as they will consume electricity directly from homes. However, many areas actually employ Electabuzz as natural lightning rods; in the wild, they will compete for spots likely to be struck by lightning during storms. Electabuzz communicate by touching each other and transferring currents. When threatened, they will use the move Thunder Punch. However, it takes them some time to windmill their arms to power up, allowing foes to flee while they are charging. This winding allows them to produce additional power for their attacks.

However, if Pinsir are unable to tear their prey in half, they will toss them far away by swinging their heads. Pinsir hate the cold and will dig burrows in forests to hibernate if the weather stays chilly for too long. They become sluggish if exposed to low temperatures, but will be rejuvenated once it warms again. In areas with cool nights, Pinsir sleep near the roots of trees in underground burrows or covered in leaves, while in places with warmer ones, they choose to sleep in or near the treetops. In addition to hunting, Pinsir also enjoy eating tree sap. Individual Pinsir have different preferences as to which kinds of trees have the best sap. They will often compete with Heracross, who also love tree sap, for choice trees; in Alola, they instead compete with Vikavolt for food, and in fact seem to get along quite well with Heracross.

They headbutt each other and lock horns to test their own strength, taking pride in scars gained from this. If Tauros cannot find any sparring partners, they will ram into trees and knock them down out of boredom. The strongest Tauros of a herd is its leader and protector. Leaders must frequently defend their titles by butting head with challengers; as such, they usually will have the longest, thickest, and most-scarred horns of the herd. Tauros only charge in straight lines. Once they start running, they will not stop until they hit something. Tauros are also angered by the color red and will charge upon sight of anything of this hue, even the blood from their own wounds. Despite their aggressiveness, however, Tauros are herbivores that graze on grass and other plants. Domesticated Tauros are considerably calmer than their wild counterparts; they are still quick to anger, however. As Alolan Tauros are mostly descended from domesticated ancestors, they are considerably calmer than those of other regions and can even be ridden with some training.","​Pokémon and all associated names and characters are trademarked and © 1995-2019 Nintendo. All non-original images are provided by Bulbapedia, © 1995-2019 Nintendo.No copyright infringement intended.","Normal"," 4'07\" | 1.4 m"," 194.9 lbs | 88.4 kg"," Intimidate | Anger Point |"," Sheer Force"," Field"," Field","

In fact, splashing Magikarp actually make easy prey for Flying-type Pokémon like Pidgeotto, who can snatch them up as they bounce. They are also weak swimmers, unable to swim through even weak currents. As a result, many of them congregate in small ponds or lakes, unable swim through river currents. Magikarp are very hardy, however, with strong survival instincts and immune systems. They are able to tolerate waters of nearly any salinity, depth, and pollution level.

This has made them easy targets for poachers, who prize their shells for their purported (but scientifically unsupported) medical properties. Lapras currently near extinction, with the few remaining being spread across the vast oceans. When in good moods, Lapras will sing beautiful, enchanting melodies that are said to calm rough seas. Lone Lapras will sing plaintive songs, calling out to any other Lapras that may be nearby. Though they live in cold seas, they migrate to warmer ones to raise their young; even in these tropical areas, a slight cold continues to radiate from their skin.  Rumors of freshwater Lapras have also surfaced from time to time. Lapras are happiest in pods, as they enjoy being in groups.

Individual Ditto may also have their own strengths and weaknesses when it comes to transforming into certain things. Their adaptability has allowed them to live in a variety of habitats, but they generally stay near humans for unknown reasons. When Ditto sleep, they morph into rocks to avoid detection. Due to their DNA-copying abilities, Ditto can breed with anything that can reproduce, other than themselves (Ditto reproduce by asexual budding and seem to oddly dislike one another). No one knows where Ditto came from, but a popular theory states that they in fact originated from a failed attempt to clone Mew.

It is said that their DNA is so unstable that given time, they may even start to look like their trainers (though this has not been studied or proven). Eevee are a very popular Pokémon, rivaling the reputations of many starter Pokémon. In fact, some regions have even considered using them as starters themselves, as they can evolve into many Pokémon of different types. Their evolutions are also colloquially referred to as “Eeveelutions,” a portmanteau of the words “Eevee” and “evolutions.” Eevee are loyal Pokémon, always staying by the sides of their trainers.

Vaporeon can swim in both saltwater and freshwater, however, though they very much prefers clean lakes to oceans. Their cellular structures are close to the molecular structure of water. Because of this property, they can essentially melt into water at will. The shape of their gills and fins make them hydrodynamic and allow them to swim gracefully. Some believe that their fins will quiver before a rainstorm, but crease prior to a drought. Vaporeon only live in clean water, so lakes they will swim in are safe to drink from.

Their cells all exude weak charges, which they can concentrate with static electricity in their fur into more powerful bolts. Additionally, by charging their fur negatively, they can bristle it into piercing spikes. Jolteon can launch these spikes at foes by using Pin Missile.

Their fur, though fluffy, is efficient at expelling heat from their bodies into the surrounding air to cool them off. As a result, the air around Flareon is usually significantly hotter than the ambient temperature. Flareon have flame sacs inside their bodies. When preparing to attack using moves like the scorching Fire Blast, they inhale deeply, filling the sacs with air. Flame glands in their bodies mix the air with volatile gases produced by their glands, igniting the mixtures. Then, they exhale the flames to attack. Like some other Fire-types, Flareon can also use the move Smog by releasing their volatile gases out of their mouths without igniting them.

Both pairs are functioning; they use their red eyes while searching for food on the sea floor and their smaller black eyes while hiding from predators in the sand, leaving these secondary pairs aboveground. When flipped over, Kabuto have great difficulty righting themselves, so they become easy targets for opportunistic predators that can attack their soft, exposed undersides. Kabuto ​feed by biting and draining fluids from their prey, a process that can be fatal for smaller victims. They tend to attack the heads of larger, slow-moving aquatic Pokémon, using their claws to dig into flesh and attaching themselves with ease. Kabuto have primitive lungs, which allow them to climb onto beaches for up to 30 minutes at a time. However, they must then return to the water afterwards, or risk drying out and being asphyxiated.

This allowed them to thrive as apex predators for a long time, as they could hunt both aquatic and terrestrial prey. However, their lungs are still not developed enough to allow them to stray far away from the water. While it is not known for certain what could have caused their extinction, a popular theory states that some kind of event led to drastically fluctuating temperatures worldwide. Ice caps melted and refroze over and over again, causing sea levels to bounce back and forth. Kabuto and Kabutops were unable to survive completely on land when their shoreline habitats dried up.

Some research has shown that they may be loosely linked to modern-day Dragon-types. Though superb fliers, they were actually quite slow and clumsy on land. Today, Aerodactyl can be revived from Old Ambers. Though they are just as ruthless and aggressive, they can be trained to control their primal instincts. Unfortunately, the first successful resurrection of an Aerodactyl resulted in some casualties at the lab in question. Surprisingly, Aerodactyl are omnivores, eating various fruits and Berries in addition to meat. They seem to especially enjoy Pamtre Berries, perhaps because these Berries are closely related to an ancient fruit they consumed long ago.

"144","Articuno","144","Isolated, snowy mountain peaks","Articuno is the first member of the legendary birds, also known as the “winged mirages” due to their elusive natures. Articuno is said to be found on snowy mountain peaks, soaring from mountain to mountain. As it flies, it cools the surrounding air, leaving a trail of glistening snow behind it. It is rarely seen, as it cloaks its mountain home in a near-unbearable blizzard. Articuno is said to appear before lost travelers in snowy mountains, right before they succumb to the cold. It is also linked with the ocean, and is said to control the freezing of icy polar waters. Articuno avoids most contact ​with humans, like the other legendary birds, and also dislikes getting involved in battles. When spotted, it will cloak itself in mist or snowstorms and disappear just as quickly as it appeared. Articuno is said to have hatched from an egg frozen in ice, hidden deep in the snow on a secluded mountain range. It hatched when a mysterious silver feather fell on the mountaintop, melting the nearby ice and allowing the egg to surface.","A legendary bird, alongside Zapdos and Moltres​Also see Lugia","Ice/Flying"," 5'07\" | 1.7 m"," 122.1 lbs | 55.4 kg"," Pressure |"," Snow Cloak"," Undiscovered"," Undiscovered","

The sky turns dark and stormy everywhere it flies, and its body emits crackling noises and sparks. As it soars, its wings sparkle due to the sheer amount of electricity they hold.  Like the other birds, Zapdos is rarely seen, and is said only to appear when thunderclouds part down the middle. It can gain power when struck by lightning bolts, both its own as well as natural ones. Because of how it becomes stronger by being around electricity, it is said to stop by at areas with large amounts of power, such as ​power plants; sightings have been reported at the Kanto Power Plant, for example. Zapdos is also said to be linked with oceans, controlling the currents flowing beneath the waves. Legend has it that Zapdos hatched when an egg was struck by lighting at the same moment a strange silver feather landed on it from above. The dark storm clouds parted around the area as the egg hatched, and Zapdos emerged to take off into the clear sky.","A legendary bird, alongside Articuno and Moltres​Also see Lugia","Electric","","/","Flying"," 5'03\" | 1.6 m"," Pressure |"," Pressure |","

Strangely, these embers mysteriously don’t burn anything they land on. They are actually purported to have healing properties, restoring life in forests and crops damaged by harsh winters. Moltres prefers hot areas, especially active volcanoes, but does not stay permanently anywhere. It is said to bring spring to wintry areas, following the change of the seasons by flying south. It is thought to submerge itself deep into magma to heal itself. Moltres is also said to control the warmth and ​fertility of tropical oceans. Due to its constant migration, Moltres has been spotted in multiple places, such as Mt. Ember in the Sevii Islands and Mt. Silver in Johto. It is said to have hatched from an egg floating in the volcanic magma. A lone silver feather floated from the sky above into the volcano, landing onto the egg. The volcano erupted, and in the midst of the blast, a winged, flaming figure emerged and flew off into the horizon.","A legendary bird, alongside Articuno and Zapdos​Also see Lugia","Fire","","/","Flying"," 6'07\" | 2.0 m"," Pressure |"," Pressure |","

"147","Dratini","147","Deep lakes","Until a fisherman caught a live Dratini from a large underwater colony about a century ago (reputedly after a 10-hour struggle), these Pokémon were long thought to be myths. This has given them the nickname the “Mirage Pokémon” (officially, they are still the Dragon Pokémon). Even today, these elusive Pokémon dwell at the bottoms of deep lakes, where they are difficult to find. Young Dratini are rather large for newborns, with some having been reported be be as long as 6.5 feet (2 meters). As they age, they grow even larger, shedding their skins periodically (sometimes as often as every day). They are extremely vulnerable after shedding, so they will hide behind powerful waterfalls away from their colonies during these times. Their bodies grow at an astounding rate, so they must shed often. These skins were likely the source of myths regarding mysterious, lake-dwelling, serpentine creatures. For a long time, people were convinced that the these skins were hoaxes. It was not until scientists compared their DNA to that of actual Dratini was finally accepted that not only were the skins authentic, but that Dratini were real as well. Today, shed Dratini skin are often treated to make luxury leather goods.","Evolves into Dragonair at Lvl 30Dragonair evolves into Dragonite at Lvl 55","Dragon"," 3'03\" | 1.0 m"," 7.3 lbs | 3.3 kg"," Shed Skin |"," Marvel Scale"," Water 1 | Dragon"," Water 1 | Dragon","

The spheres also seem to be enable them to influence the weather. When these orbs glow, Dragonair are using their auras to alter the climate—by making it rain or parting a storm, for example. Their bodies also glow slightly while doing so. Also known as the “Divine Pokémon,” Dragonair were long thought to be mythical and worshipped by farmers for their purported weather-altering powers. People often left offerings at their lakes in hope of favorable weather. Dragonair also have the ability to fly. They ​do not use this ability often, though, as they prefer staying submerged deep at the bottoms of freshwater lakes. When they do fly, however, the small feather-like ornaments on their head spread out like wings. Whether this is purely aesthetic or an aid them in flight somehow is not yet known. Dragonair shed their skin periodically, but not as frequently as Dratini. These skins were at first mistaken for huge Dratini, and fetched hefty sums as collectors clamored over them. According to popular legend, seeing a Dragonair flying overhead at the start of a new year is a sign of good health for the rest of the year.","Evolves from Dratini at Lvl 30Evolves into Dragonite at Lvl 55","Dragon"," 13'01\" | 4.0 m"," 36.4 lbs | 16.5 kg"," Shed Skin |"," Marvel Scale"," Water 1 | Dragon"," Water 1 | Dragon","

They can circumnavigate the globe in just 16 hours. They are known to rescue drowning Pokémon and people from stormy seas, which they can easily weather with their sturdy bodies. They also lead ships out of ocean storms. Dragonite are very intelligent, with minds on par with those of adult humans. Though almost always gentle, Dragonite can go on destructive rampages when angered. They will relentlessly destroy everything around them until they tire and collapse. Luckily, it takes a lot to anger Dragonite, as they are incredibly kind and forgiving. In battle, Dragonite can decimate opponents with the powerful Outrage. Legend has it that somewhere far out in the middle of the sea, there exists an island populated solely by Dragonite; a popular myth tells of a shipwrecked man being rescued and taken to this island.

The result of manmade experiments with the goal of reproducing Mew, Mewtwo was born in a laboratory said to be hidden in the Cinnabar Pokémon Mansion. It was supposed to be a bigger, more powerful Mew--the perfect battling Pokémon--and in that aspect, it was successful. However, it also became more aggressive, breaking out of its lab and destroying it before fleeing into solitude. While part of its anger may have been from the numerous gene splices it underwent, much of it may have stemmed from the fact ​that it had become self-aware; it knew that it was a clone, that it did not belong. It was created without any compassion--its sole purpose was to battle and to win. Mewtwo is said to meditate, not for peace, but to conserve energy for fighting. One look into its eyes to see its seething rage can strike fear in any being. It is said that this Pokémon has the most savage heart of them all, and only the most virtuous trainer could ever even try to reach out to it.","Can Mega Evolve into Mega Mewtwo X or Mega Mewtwo Y​Also see Mew","Psychic"," 6'07\" | 2.0 m"," 269.0 lbs | 122.0 kg"," Pressure |"," Unnerve"," Undiscovered"," Undiscovered","

It is rarely ever seen, leading many to believe that it is just a mirage. It can also make itself invisible at will, making sightings even more elusive. Mew is often depicted surrounded in a pink bubble or sphere. A single hair from this Pokémon was used to create Mewtwo. Mew is said to only appear to the pure-hearted who desire to see it. The number of sightings have been increasing over the past few years, though it is not certain how many of them are actually legitimate. Unlike Mewtwo, Mew appears to be playful and innocent. Notably, many sightings seem to have involved children or soft music, especially lullabies. Recently, there were also a huge number of sightings near a truck in the port of Vermillion City, Kanto. However, they was proven to be nothing more than a hoax.

"152","Chikorita","152","Johto grasslands","Roughly a third of all beginning trainers from Johto choose Chikorita to be their starting Pokémon. They are regarded as the easiest of the Johto starters to train, due to their docile natures--they aren’t as rambunctious as Totodile nor as flighty as Cyndaquil. Chikorita primarily photosynthesize energy using their large leaves. Because of this, they spend most of their time peacefully sunbathing. Their leaves are highly sensitive to temperature and humidity. They love bright, sunny weather--in fact, one of the only times trainers may their see Chikorita upset is when the Pokémon are prevented from going out on beautiful days. Their leaves (and the buds around their necks) also release a calming fragrance that causes those around them to become more amiable. When threatened, they wave their leaves around to placate foes. This scent has been proven effective enough to be marketed to consumers; Erika of the Celadon Gym touts it under the label Synthesis, for instance. Thanks to their calm natures, it is no surprise that Chikorita continue to be popular Johto starter Pokémon.","﻿Evolves into Bayleef at Lvl 16Bayleef evolves into Meganium at Lvl 32","Grass"," 2'11\" | 0.9 m"," 14.1 lbs | 6.4 kg"," Overgrow |"," "," Monster | Grass"," Monster | Grass","

In contrast to the placating aroma of Chikorita, Bayleef release an invigorating fragrance from their budding “necklaces” that can perk up even the most tired people and Pokémon (the scent is also marketed as a perfume known as Work Up by the Celadon Gym Leader Erika). The fragrance can make one feel renewed and ready to fight. Oftentimes, people who raise Chikorita for their calming scents are surprised after they evolve; they suddenly want to get up and out of the house to have fun. Each of the curled-up leaves surrounding a Bayleef’s neck contains a small, growing, flower, responsible for releasing their characteristic fragrance. Bayleef can sometimes be stubborn and even hot-headed at times, but they still retain the friendliness and affection they had as Chikorita. As they approach evolution, their scents strengthen and the buds around their necks enlarge and become more vivid. Bayleef also become more lively as they grow, sometimes to the exasperation of their trainers.","﻿Evolves from Chikorita at Lvl 16Evolves into Meganium at Lvl 32","Grass"," 3'11\" | 1.2 m"," 34.8 lbs | 15.8 kg"," Overgrow |"," "," Monster | Grass"," Monster | Grass","

There is almost never fighting near Meganium, as their fragrance can calm even the most aggressive of foes. Trainers often compare the feeling of relaxation from being around Meganium to a “day in a tranquil forest,” fitting for such Pokémon. They hate conflict and prefers to placate enemies with their aroma, though they can still release the invigorating scent they did as Bayleef when necessary. Meganium can attack with moves like Razor Leaf and Petal Dance when they feel threatened. Their breaths can revive dead flora; the grasslands in which these Pokémon are rarely found in the wild are beautifully vibrant as a result. They communicate by releasing various scents and waving the stamens on their heads. Meganium remain extremely affectionate and defensive of their trainers, which is why they are worthy choices for any trainers looking forward to starting their journeys in the Johto region.","﻿Chikorita evolves into Bayleef at Lvl 16Evolves from Bayleef at Lvl 32","Grass"," 5'11\" | 1.8 m"," 221.6 lbs | 100.5 kg"," Overgrow |"," "," Monster | Grass"," Monster | Grass","

They are very timid creatures; their first reaction to anything new is to run away and curl up into balls. If angered or startled, the flames on their backs will erupt. They burn vigorously most of the time, but will sputter and die out sporadically if the Pokémon are tired. If the flames are not enough to deter enemies, Cyndaquil can also use Smokescreen to cloak themselves and buy time to flee. They rarely fight back, due to their flighty natures, but may attack with Ember or Swift when cornered. Trainers must be careful when raising Cyndaquil, as they are easily startled--frightened Cyndaquil will instinctively flare up their backs. Despite this potential problem, they can be very playful and cheerful, if a bit skittish. It is said that trainers who choose Cyndaquil at the beginning of their journeys also tend to be good caretakers of children, especially younger, timid ones.","﻿Evolves into Quilava at Lvl 14Quilava evolves into Typhlosion at Lvl 36","Fire"," 1'08\" | 0.5 m"," 17.4 lbs | 7.9 kg"," Blaze |"," "," Field"," Field","

In battle, when Quilava turn their backs against their opponents, they are preparing to flare up their backs. These flames burn hotter in combat. Their fur is also nonflammable and does not conduct heat, allowing them to keep their fires burning for long periods of time. This fur is notably very soft, with many remarking that its texture is similar to that of Furret—synthetic versions have been used by many designer fashionistas. Quilava are also very agile, allowing them to maneuver around attacks thrown at them. They can utilize the move Flame Wheel to defend themselves, leaving behind lingering trails of fire that provide barriers against opponents.

By rubbing their blazing fur against itself, they can create giant explosions that incinerate everything nearby. Brutal fights between two Typhlosion over territory can sometimes devastate acres of grasslands. These Pokémon will flare up their manes to determine dominance; the individuals with larger manes gain control of the land, unless the losers decide to fight it out in battle. Females are highly protective of their young, caring for them until adolescence, and will destroy anything they see as threats to them.

They love to play--but unfortunately for most trainers, their favorite games almost all involve biting. They have the habit of chomping nearly anything novel that moves, and due to the raw strength of their jaws, they will often crush the things they bite. The Totodile given out as starter Pokémon in Johto are all trained to not bite humans, but the same cannot be said about the rare wild Totodile one may occasionally come across; while very playful and friendly with humans, they will snap at the arms and legs of people when they lower their guards to “investigate” the foreign beings. Though they are simply “playing,” these bites can cause serious injury, sometimes even resulting in fractured bones. Even trained Totodile may occasionally crunch on and destroy possessions like watches, bags, phones, and on at least one recorded occasion, Pokédexes. Due to these potential obstacles, Totodile are often seen as the hardest, though perhaps the most rewarding, to raise Johto starters.","﻿Evolves into Croconaw at Lvl 18Croconaw evolves into Feraligatr at Lvl 30","Water"," 2'00\" | 0.6 m"," 20.9 lbs | 9.5 kg"," Torrent |"," "," Monster | Water 1"," Monster | Water 1","

This angle makes it nearly impossible to remove Croconaw after they bite; they will refuse to let go after snapping onto anything, holding on until their fangs fall off. Luckily for them, though, these teeth can grow back in as little as a week. Croconaw can open their jaws wide enough to latch onto things nearly twice the size of their heads. When they swim, only the spiked crests on their heads and backs are visible; the rest of their bodies remain submerged underwater as they hunt fish, their primary source of food. When not hunting, they are known to bite stones to test the strength of their jaws and teeth. Bite marks on rocks near lakeshores and riversides are signs of Croconaw territory. Loose, fishhook-shaped teeth lying on the ground and floating in the water are another sign that Croconaw are likely nearby.","﻿Evolves from Totodile at Lvl 18Evolves into Feraligatr at Lvl 30","Water"," 3'07\" | 1.1 m"," 55.1 lbs | 25.0 kg"," Torrent |"," "," Monster | Water 1"," Monster | Water 1","

They can walk on both bipedally and quadrupedally, though they prefer the latter. However, when they spot enemies or prey, Feraligatr can quickly charge forward at a blinding speed on two legs to capture them between their powerful jaws, shaking their heads to tear up their victims. They can intimidate foes simply by opening their giant mouths and roaring; this display, along with the size of the red crests on their heads, is also used in displays of dominance. They can use Crunch to crush boulders with ease and can knock back foes with the powerful Aqua Tail. Like Croconaw, Feraligatr swim with just the upper halves of their heads and their back crests above the water. They swish their powerful tails and arms to propel themselves while using their arms and legs to steer and stay afloat. For trainers who are willing to endure the antics of their pre-evolutions, the brute strength and power of Feraligatr makes them great candidates for starter Pokémon in Johto.","﻿Totodile evolves into Croconaw at Lvl 18Evolves from Croconaw at Lvl 30","Water"," 7'07\" | 2.3 m"," 195.8 lbs | 88.8 kg"," Torrent |"," "," Monster | Water 1"," Monster | Water 1","

Using powerful muscles in these appendages, Sentret can lift themselves up to scout out their surroundings. Their sensitive ears can pick up minute sounds, alerting them quickly to potential dangers. Being social Pokémon, Sentret live in groups. Members take shifts on guard duty; at any given hour, there will be at least one Sentret keeping watch for a group. They are very nervous Pokémon--upon the first sign of trouble, they will begin thumping their tails wildly and crying out to alert their allies. Sentret care closely for and are heavily dependent upon their friends. If a Sentret is separated from its group, it becomes unable to sleep, partly from loneliness and partly from the constant, instinctual need to have an ally on guard duty--without anyone to split their patrols with, lone Sentret feel compelled to stay up and keep watch indefinitely all by themselves until they simply collapse from sheer exhaustion.","﻿Evolves into Furret at Lvl 15","Normal"," 2'07\" | 0.8 m"," 13.2 lbs | 6.0 kg"," Run Away |"," Keen "," Field"," Field","

Instead of groups, Furret choose to settle down with mates for life, making nests in narrow burrows that only they can fit into. These burrows are often maze-like in order to confuse potential predators looking for their offspring. Furret mother their children by wrapping their long bodies around their nests, caring for their young until they are old enough to join groups of their own. In battle, they are very flexible and agile. By squirming around in every direction, they can easily confuse enemies and escape with quick, precise dashes. This skill is also helpful when they are hunting their main prey, Rattata. Furret fur is prized for its softness. However, due to concerns about Pokémon cruelty, most major manufacturers have switched to faux-Furret, though a few black-market Furret sweaters and scarves unfortunately still surface every now and then.","﻿Evolves from Sentret at Lvl 15","Normal"," 5'11\" | 1.8 m"," 71.6 lbs | 32.5 kg"," Run Away |"," Keen "," Field"," Field","

Curiously, although they have two feet, they always stands on only one, even when sleeping. Like metronomes, Hoothoot sometimes rock back and forth to steady rhythms, with each sway being equivalent to one second; each second is a “tick” in their swaying. Hoothoot can be trained to hoot at a specific time every day, and for that reason, often are used in place of alarm clocks and watches for trainers traveling across regions. Their unbelievably precise readings of the time have led them and their evolution Noctowl to be revered as wise and all-knowing in the past, or even as divine messengers.

They can solve mental problems on par with above-average human adults. Their heads are capable of turning 180°, both backwards and upside-down. It is thought that when a Noctowl completely inverts its head, it is in deep thought; in fact, this is a warning that signals caution, and the Noctowl may attack with a flurry of pecks if not left alone after this. Additionally, Noctowl are also a superb hunters. Their eyes are adapted to see with even the tiniest amounts of light, allowing them to fly around with ease even when the moon is obscured. Their soft feathers produce no sound when they flap, enabling them to sneak up on prey without being noticed. They can spot scurrying Rattata in forests below from over a mile (1.6 km) away. Despite their Normal- and Flying-types, Noctowl also possess a variety of Psychic-type techniques, such as Hypnosis, Extrasensory, and Zen Headbutt--perhaps some evidence towards their purported future-seeing powers.

Their feet secrete odorous fluids that they use to communicate with others; a sour smell signals anger, for instance. When temperatures drop, swarms will congregate together on lone trees, huddling together for warmth. They will use Reflect en-masse to protect their nests when in danger. Ledyba are major pollinators in forests; as their swarms flit about, they pollinate hundreds of flowers along the way. Their activity directly correlates with higher temperatures, being most active in the summer as well as in warm regions like Alola. Many gardeners release Ledyba swarms numbering in the thousands into their orchards to pollinate at the blow of a whistle. In exchange, they get a portion of the crop produced. Ledyba are strictly diurnal and are almost never seen being active at night.

They are also active in places with clean air; Ledian swarms are a good sign of air quality. As they fly, they scatter a shimmery glowing dust below. The true purpose of this powder is unknown, but a popular myth says that it ensures sweet dreams for good children and Pokémon sleeping below, as well as good fortune for those that it lands on. The size of the spots on their backs seem to correlate with the number of visible stars in the sky. The more stars out, the larger the spots.

The material was once even used by fishers to make nets. Spinarak weave intricate webs of silk and then wait for prey to come by. They are very patient and can wait motionless for days or weeks for prey to arrive. When victims get tangled in their webs, they can detect the movements and even tell what was captured by the vibrations they create. Spinarak always wait for night to fall before investigating their catches. They subdue their prey, if still struggling, with venom, and then feast on their meals. Though their venom is not particularly strong, it is more than enough to incapacitate smaller prey. They can survive for weeks at a time on a good meal. The designs on their backs shift based on their moods. Spinarak and Ariados are often maligned in popular culture, portrayed as villains and aggressive hunters. In reality, Spinarak are actually playful Pokémon who only bite when threatened, and Ariados, while territorial, will also not attack unless provoked. One notable positive portrayal of these Pokémon was a popular children’s novel about the unlikely friendship between a young Swinub and a local Spinarak.","﻿Evolves into Ariados at Lvl 22","Bug","/Poison"," 1'08\" | 0.5 m"," 18.7 lbs | 8.5 kg"," Swarm | Insomnia |"," Bug"," Bug","

"168","Ariados","168","Forests, woodlands","Ariados can spin silk from their rears as well as their mouths. They use this to confuse both predators and prey about their true heads. Their legs have tiny claws that allow them to climb on walls and ceilings to ambush prey from any direction. When hunting, they do not wait in their webs like Spinarak. Instead, they shoot globs of silk at targets and then let them return home; they can then follow them back to their shelters and prey on all of their friends as well. Ariados are nocturnal, wandering in search of food only at night. They are also very territorial. They clearly mark boundaries with strings of old webs. Entering an Ariados’s territory will provoke it into attacking in order to defend itself; unless one owns a Fire-, Rock-, or Flying-type, circumventing a webbed area is strongly advised. Ariados poison, if left untreated, can be fatal in as little as 2 minutes. They can also use Spider Web or Toxic Thread to trap escaping foes—another reason why bothering wild Ariados is a foolish idea. Despite their danger, some people enjoy wearing Ariados silk clothing because of its sturdiness.","﻿Evolves from Spinarak at Lvl 22","Bug","/Poison"," 3'07\" | 1.1 m"," 73.9 lbs | 33.5 kg"," Swarm | Insomnia |"," Bug"," Bug","

While the pairs improves their maneuverability and airspeed, it also makes it difficult for them to stop, land, or rest. Crobat leave their caves at night, flying silently in the darkness in search of food. Though large, Crobat are silent fliers. They can alternate between their two sets of wings when tired, allowing them to fly for indefinite periods of time. When dawn arrives, Crobat will either return back to their caves or hang from under tree branches, wrapping their wings around themselves until thesun sets again. Crobat are not aggressive towards humans. They usually do not attack people, instead only going after what they see as viable prey. For unknown reasons, Crobat in the Alolan region are an exception to this, and have been known to attack unwary travelers. Their fangs are sharp and coated with an an analgesic that numbs the bitten area so that victims don't even know they've been bitten until afterwards. Crobat are more than capable of lashing out with moves like Air Slash or Poison Fang if angered. In other regions, Crobat prefer to feast on insects and small rodents, subduing them with poison before draining them of blood them.

These bulbs help them attract prey in the deep ocean, luring them in with bright light and then electrocuting them when they come too close. For this reason, they are a popular Pokémon amongst fishermen, especially night anglers. They constantly release large amount of both positive and negative charges. Chinchou who have not discharged recently can be seen shuddering from their electricity. They communicate by flashing their bulbs in specific patterns. For instance, they will flash signals to other Chinchou in the area in order to claim their territories. These Pokémon lives in schools of 20-30 individuals, though numerous groups numbering in the hundreds have been recorded during mating season. During this time, Chinchou head onto land en masse, where they perform intricate mating rituals involving the flashing and waving of their bulbs in patterns. People often come to see these spectacles, splashing Chinchou with water as they trek further inland to keep them hydrated. At the ends of these rituals, pairs of Chinchou head back into the water, lighting up the sea beautifully.","﻿Evolves into Lanturn at Lvl 27","Water/","Electric",""," 1'08\" | 0.5 m"," 26.5 lbs | 12.0 kg"," "," ","

Lanturn travel in small pods of 3-5 members. When hunting, they lure prey in with light before disorienting victims with quick, brilliant flashes or immobilizing them with paralyzing shocks. They then swallow their prey whole. Lanturn compete with Lumineon for prey. Pods of them swimming in the depths of the ocean’s murky blackness are sometimes seen by fishing boats on the surface. Until recently, these “sea wisps” were an unexplained phenomenon, with theories ranging from secret government submarine vessels to unidentified aquatic aliens. Now, they are commonly used by fishermen to lead their boats; in addition to being adept in the water and providing ample light, Lanturn can also shock fish with electricity and make them easier to catch.","﻿Evolves from Chinchou at Lvl 27","Water/","Electric"," 3'11\" | 1.2 m"," 49.6 lbs | 22.5 kg"," Volt Absorb | Illuminate |","Water Absorb","Water Absorb","

However, as baby Pokémon, they are rather inexperienced and are oftentimes unable to hold on to electricity for long periods of time. Pichu almost always discharge all of their electricity in single quick bursts; even laughing too hard can cause them to discharge. This can often be an issue because Pichu tend to be much more energetic and playful when fully charged. They hurt themselves when releasing electricity because they cannot control their shocks. Pichu can knock out adult humans with their uncontrolled bursts. They touch tails with each other as tests of courage, releasing shower of sparks that frighten them and nearly cause them to cry; “brave” Pichu will hold in their tears.

On these nights, Cleffa can be seen dancing in rings as meteors streak across the sky. They dance until dawn and disappear quickly once the last meteor falls. They are almost never seen at any other time and seem to nourish themselves on morning dew that condenses during these rituals. It is said that seeing a ring of Cleffa dancing will bring good luck upon onlookers. Cleffa are drawn to Moon Stones and often hold them while dancing. However, they are more fascinated with rare Comet Shards. Trained Cleffa who come across them will attempt to hoard them, though their rarity makes collections of any more than a dozen unheard of. It is theorized that wild Cleffa colonies have stashes in the hundreds somewhere in the mountains, reconstructing comets to take them home.

Luckily, their stretchy bodies protect them from harm during these rolls. Igglybuff love to practice their singing, aspiring to reach the levels of talent of their evolutions. However, due to their underdeveloped vocal cords, they quickly develop sore throats after just a few songs. These Pokémon then will search for water to gargle in order to soothe their voices. These Pokémon practice diligently and sometimes will not stop until their trainers intervene; it is joked that they even dream of singing in their sleep! Igglybuff sweat a scent similar to that of marshmallows (which they are often said to feel like).

Just being around them can make one feel joyful. Conversely, when surrounded by corrupted people or Pokémon, they become weak due to the lack of “good” energy around them. Togepi, as baby Pokémon, are also known for their low tolerance for hunger. If they become famished, they will cry loudly and incessantly until fed. After eating, they draw themselves entirely into their shells and take long naps. Upon hatching, Togepi view the first living things that they see as their mothers, regardless of species or gender; they will refuse to leave the sides of their parents no matter what. As a result, the majority of trained Togepi are either hatched from eggs or orphaned, since Togepi separated from their “mothers” will refuse to do anything, even intentionally starving themselves (and crying) until their parents find and feed them.","﻿Evolves into Togetic with high happiness​Togetic evolves into Togekiss with a Shiny Stone","Fairy"," 1'00\" | 0.3 m"," 3.3 lbs | 1.5 kg"," Hustle | Serene Grace |"," Super Luck"," Undiscovered"," Undiscovered","

Since they obtain much of their livelihood from kind Pokémon and people and are weakened from being around “impure” ones, Togetic fly around the world in search of pure-hearted beings, sharing their joy with them. They can fly for long periods of time without flapping their wings, appearing to levitate. However, it does appear that they must flap every once in a while to keep themselves aloft. The “joy dust” Togetic shower on people is currently being extensively researched by scientists, who are experimenting with its possible use in the future as an antidepressant.

Natu are also fond of cactus plants and can deftly hop between spines to reach the fruit of these plants without injuring themselves. They have surprisingly powerful legs and can launch themselves from the ground into the branches of trees. Natu never blink; they have the habit of staring at objects motionlessly for long periods of time until the objects stir. Many explorers searching for lost ruins are said to have gone insane due to their “hallucinations” of hundreds of eyes staring at them from the jungle’s inky blackness. Natu are also very cautious Pokémon. Some believe that this is due in part to their supposed future-seeing, prophetic abilities.

Their wool is used to make various different articles of clothing like jackets and sweaters, though it must first be treated to reduce its static-generating properties. Their coats grows continuously, but are shed periodically every summer. If sheared, this wool can grow back within a week. Their fur stores pockets of air that insulate them, keeping Mareep warm during colder months are cool during hotter ones. As they wander about, their wool, which generates static very easily, rubs together and begins storing electricity. Their coats will double in size once fully charged. Because touching their wool in this state would lead to a nasty shock, it is necessary for ranch hands to don rubber gloves while shearing or otherwise handling flocks of Mareep. The small orbs at the end of their tails will glow more brightly depending on how much static electricity they have charged up in their wool. Experienced trainers and farm workers will know on sight whether or not a Mareep is safe to touch, depending on the intensity of its bulb.","﻿Evolves into Flaaffy at Lvl 15Flaaffy evolves into Ampharos at Lvl 30","Electric"," 2'00\" | 0.6 m"," 17.2 lbs | 7.8 kg"," Static |"," Plus"," Monster | Field"," Monster | Field","

Flaaffy will also begin to grow bald in patches where static generation is abnormally high. To make up for the smaller quantities of wool on their bodies, Flaaffy wool is much higher in quality and can store more electricity. Because it is softer, this wool is more prized; it is harder to come by and more pricey, though, because Flaaffy don’t shed as often as Mareep. Because of its texture and price tag, Flaaffy wool is very popular among those following cutting-edge fashion. Flaaffy can fire strands of their wool at opponents to electrocute them.

Due to this, Ampharos are often employed in lighthouses, like the Glitter Lighthouse in Olivine City, to warn ships of rocky shores. In the past, people also used Ampharos to communicate over long distances. By flashing lights in Morse code, people could send messages to each other “via Ampharos.” In lighthouses, Ampharos are still trained to signal “S.O.S” in Morse to relay emergency signals for people working inside. One can tell the state of an Ampharos’s health by the strength of its tail light. The brighter the light, the healthier the individual. On the other hand. flickering, dimly glowing lights are signals of sickness or exhaustion. In the wild, these Pokémon usually keep their tails unlit to avoid detection from enemies.

Because of this, some trainers use Skiploom as natural thermometers, gauging the air temperature based on how open their flowers are. In particularly cold weather, their flowers close up completely and their floating abilities are severely hampered. Excessive water can also be detrimental to Skiploom.

During cooler, cloudier summers, Sunkern will go into hibernation and seem to disappear entirely. Then, the following year, if the summer weather improves, Sunkern populations will appear to explode as masses of hibernating Sunkern reawaken to bask in the warm sunlight.","﻿Evolves into Sunflora with a Sun Stone","Grass"," 1'00\" | 0.3 m"," 4.0 lbs | 1.8 kg"," Chlorophyll | Solar Power |"," "," Grass"," Grass","

"192","Sunflora","192","Fields, meadows","Sunflora are diurnal Pokémon; their activity follows the position of the sun in the sky. In the morning, Sunflora begin to stir, opening their petals and turning to face the rising sun. In the afternoon, when the sun is highest in the sky, they move around actively, almost frantically, following the sun as it travels. They slow down again at sunset; then, when night falls, Sunflora close their petals and become completely immobile, repeating the cycle again the next day. The color of a Sunflora’s petals also reflects the sun. The brighter and warmer the sunlight that shines on it is, the more vivid its petals become. Oddly, this reaction does not occur when Sunflora are exposed to artificial sunlight, instead only happening when they are bathed in the unfiltered, natural light of the sun. Sunflora subsist almost entirely on sunlight and water, photosynthesizing sugars to create energy for themselves. Though they acquire some trace nutrients by absorbing them from the soil that they tread upon, they obtain the bulk of their consumed energy from the sun. ","﻿Evolves from Sunkern with a Sun Stone","Grass"," 2'07\" | 0.8 m"," 18.7 lbs | 8.5 kg"," Chlorophyll | Solar Power |"," "," Grass"," Grass","

They can fly in any direction: forwards, backwards, up, down, left, and right; they can even hover in place. They flap their wings extremely quickly; to defend themselves, Yanma can increase the speed of their flapping to generate shock waves and stun foes. These waves are strong enough to shatter glass windows. Their compound eyes can turn 360°, allowing them to see in virtually any direction. This is useful when Yanma are hunting their preferred prey--insects. Yanma are very territorial against other Yanma, defending their domains from intruders with attacks like Sonic Boom and Bug Buzz. They primarily reside in humid swamps and marshes, though they can also be found in damper woodlands. Yanma catch insects in their strong mandibles, oftentimes grabbing them out of the air mid-flight and carrying them back to their nests to feed upon in private. They use the two long growths on either end of their tails to remain balanced as they quickly dart around in search of food.","﻿Evolves into Yanmega when leveled up while knowing Ancient Power","Bug","/Flying"," 3'11\" | 1.2 m"," 83.8 lbs | 38.0 kg"," Speed Boost | Compound Eyes |"," Bug"," Bug","

"194","Wooper","194","Ponds, lakes, rivers, marshes","Wooper make their homes in cooler areas of fresh water. Though they prefer brisk rivers and ponds, they have a low tolerance for icy waters and subzero temperatures. As amphibians, Wooper are able to survive both in water and on land. In fact, they alter their hunting patterns from water to land based on the weather; when it is cooler, such as in the evening, Wooper will hunt terrestrially, but when it is warmer, like during the day, they will hunt aquatically. They cover themselves with a slimy film to stay moist outside of the water. This film is poisonous; Wooper will often leave trails of this slime walking around on land. While contact this film can cause searing pain, it is not fatal. The growths on the sides of their heads are in fact gills; individuals with larger gills are considered more attractive to mates. When resting, Wooper will bury themselves in the sand to hide from predators. Some populations have been observed to cease development in this form, never evolving into Quagsire during their lifespans.","﻿Evolves into Quagsire at Lvl 20","Water/","Ground"," 1'04\" | 0.4 m"," 18.7 lbs | 12.0 kg"," Damp | Water Absorb |","Unaware","Unaware","

Quagsire will often bump into nearby objects as they swim, including boulders and boat hulls. However, they are unfazed by these collisions, in part due to their strong skulls. Even when hunting, Quagsire remain at ease. They don’t move in search of food; instead, they simply remain in one place and hold their mouths agape, waiting for unwary prey to swim through. Then, they just close their mouths to catch their food. Although it isn’t a terribly efficient manner of hunting, this technique suffices for Quagsire since they expend very little energy in the first place. Though their bodies are just as slimy as those of Wooper, Quagsire slime is not poisonous like that of their pre-evolutions. Scientists believe that Wooper poison is simply a temporarily evolutionary development adapted by the species to protect themselves while still young and vulnerable.","﻿Evolves from Wooper at Lvl 20","Water/","Ground"," 4'07\" | 1.4 m"," 165.3 lbs | 75.0 kg"," Damp | Water Absorb |","Unaware","Unaware","

Espeon are skilled at prediction, able to foretell events before they occur. When their forked tails quiver, they are deep in thought conjecturing what will happen next. Their superfine fur, which feels like velvet, can detect minute air currents and help them predict the attacks of foes. Some say they can even read the thoughts of enemies in a similar fashion. This ability to detect air currents also makes Espeon reliable forecasters of the weather. Their large ears aid them in their predictions, allowing them to hear the slightest sounds. Espeon are extremely loyal to their trainers. They will not hesitate to defend them with the powerful Psychic if necessary. The gems on their heads glow when they use their abilities, and are in fact said to be the source of their powers. They will dull when Espeon are weakened or ill. In popular culture, Espeon are connected with the sun and daylight, likely due to their conditions for evolution.

These rings react in the presence of moonlight, glowing faintly when exposed to it; Umbreon seem to become stronger under these conditions. They glow brightest under a full moon, coincidentally also the time when Umbreon are the strongest. The rings will also glow when Umbreon experience strong emotions like happiness or anger. When agitated, Umbreon will sweat a poisonous substance from their pores and spray it in the eyes of foes, paralyzing them in minutes. They aim for the throats of prey when hunting. They are very protective of their trainers and will chase aggressors with Pursuit.

Murkrow will aggravate travelers into chasing them and then lead them down winding paths in dark forests before simply flying away, leaving them stranded and lost in the middle of nowhere. Urban Murkrow play similar tricks on people in dark alleyways in sketchy neighborhoods. They enjoy collecting shiny things; there are reports of Murkrow swooping down from the sky and snatching rings right off the hands of newlyweds. This puts them in direct competition with another urban thief, Meowth. The two often steal from each other’s hoards. People who come across either of their stashes will commonly find stolen objects dating back decades. In badlands, they are also known to infiltrate  Gabite hoards in search of treasure. Murkrow are often underlings for their evolutions Honchkrow, stealing for their their bosses’ hoards.

Scientists think that the toxin secreted into their brains by the transformed Shellder latched on their heads is the source of their brainpower. Every time Slowking yawn, the attached Shellder inject more toxin into their brains, increasing their thinking capacities. Slowking enjoy conducting research, often managing their own studies separately from their trainers. When they have intuitive thoughts, the gems on their shells will light up. Curiously, their knowledge appears to somehow be stored in the Shellder on their heads; if these Shellder ever become dislodged and fall off, Slowking lose all the information they had learned from their studies, reverting to the same intellectual level as Slowpoke; reattaching the Shellder will restore their wit. Humorously, some say that a vestige of Slowpoke's dimwittedness remains, and Slowking are cursed to always forget truly world-changing ideas as soon as another dawns on them. Some island cultures worship Slowking as all-knowing shamans, referring to them as \"sages of the sea\".

They startle unwary travelers to feed on their fear, which they store in the red orbs around their necks. It is said that one can hear shrieking emanating from these orbs if one sets his or her ears next to them. In order to elicit the emotions they require to feed, Misdreavus may try a variety of tactics. The simplest trick they use is materializing right in front of travelers to startle them. Other ploys include pulling hair, lighting up their orbs in total darkness, and laughing maniacally under cover of the night. Their most famous tactic, however, is letting loose unearthly howls, screams, cries, or wails that can be heard for miles, thoroughly disturbing any living beings that are unfortunate enough to hear them. Misdreavus appear to take pleasure in creating mischief, sometimes playing tricks on others just for fun and not even feeding on the subsequent emotions that they cause. Conversely, they can get upset when confronted with individuals that they are unable to scare. They are solely nocturnal and will sleep in dark caves and tree hollows during the day.

Unown come in 28 different forms, each resembling a letter of the Latin alphabet (and two resembling punctuation marks); it is unknown whether Unown or the written language came first. Ancient hieroglyphs found in ruins seem to indicate the former, as the carvings appeared to mimic the body shapes of the different forms of Unown. Unown appear to act with a hive mind, though researchers are not yet sure how they communicate, though electromagnetic waves and telepathy seem to be the most likely candidates. A single Unown is rather weak alone, but when two or more are near each other, strange phenomena begin to occur. Reports of reality warping, wish-granting, and other bizarre activities have been traced back to large swarms of Unown. These Pokémon are believed to be connected with many elusive legendaries, as well as the mysterious secrets of the universe itself.","​Pokémon and all associated names and characters are trademarked and © 1995-2019 Nintendo. All non-original images are provided by Bulbapedia, © 1995-2019 Nintendo.No copyright infringement intended.","Psychic"," 1'08\" | 0.5 m"," 11.0 lbs | 5.0 kg"," Levitate"," Undiscovered","Overview","Overview","

When Wobbuffet are attacked, they inflate themselves and counter; even so, they won’t attack again unless their foes are unwise enough to attack twice. Their unconfrontational natures can have rather humorous side effects. Wobbuffet are territorial Pokémon, but will refuse to attack unless struck first. Thus, when two Wobbuffet meet, they will have a stand-off of sorts, refusing to budge before the other. Such duels quickly become fasting contests. One notable exception to their passiveness is when it comes to defending their tails. They will ferociously attack anyone who threatens them and will go to great lengths to keep them concealed in darkness (such as only leaving their caves at night).

The brains in their true heads are far more developed and are the main source of their psychic powers; their rear heads are rather primitive and can only focus on one object at a time. The two brains appear to be connected in some manner. When Girafarig graze on grass and tree shoots, their rear heads mimic the chewing motions the true heads make even though they aren’t actually eating anything. Similar behavior can be observed when Girafarig vocalize, spit, yawn, or otherwise use their mouths. Though the rear heads have rudimentary brains, they also have very well-developed senses of smell. They react to particularly alluring scents by lashing out and biting. This enables Girafarig to fend from threats approaching from behind. Their rear heads don’t need sleep. Thus, they are able to keep watch and defend against enemies even when the main heads are resting.","​Pokémon and all associated names and characters are trademarked and © 1995-2019 Nintendo. All non-original images are provided by Bulbapedia, © 1995-2019 Nintendo.No copyright infringement intended.","Normal","/Psychic"," 4'11\" | 1.5 m"," 91.4 lbs | 41.5 kg"," Inner Focus | Early Bird |"," Field"," Field","

They also uses this fluid to attach pieces of tree bark to themselves, creating thicker, makeshift shells that protect them from avian Pokémon who mistake them for actual pinecones. Older individuals can construct huge shells this way, with some surrounding themselves with so much bark that the branches supporting them begin to sag or even break. Pineco don’t move much, sticking to the same branch until evolution. They remain sedentary and feed upon unsuspecting insects that land on the bark surrounding them and become trapped in the sticky fluid they secrete. This resin is fragrant, smelling like the pine trees they are often found on. Multiple Pineco can often be found living in a single tree, sometimes even on the same branches. When such trees are disturbed, Pineco are known to drop off of their branches in order to defend their neighbors.

They are insectivores, catching bugs that are attracted to the scent of Pineco resin around them. Forretress can no longer produce this rein themselves, however, so they are always found within trees of Pineco colonies. Researchers are baffled by the contents of their shells. Forretress carapaces are impenetrable even by the marvels of modern science. They only crack open just barely wide enough to catch prey, and do it so quickly that the motion is practically invisible to the naked eye. Though Forretress can still explode like Pineco, they prefer to defend themselves with Spikes. Their shells naturally chip from outside weather conditions--by periodically spinning rapidly, they can dislodge sharp, broken pieces of their shells onto the ground below to deter predators from approaching. This maneuver is in fact a defensive reflex that triggers instinctually whenever Forretress are startled.","﻿Evolves from Pineco at Lvl 31","Bug","/","Steel"," 3'11\" | 1.2 m"," 277.3 lbs | 125.8 kg"," Overcoat"," Overcoat","

When threatened, they will burrow backwards into the earth using their drill-like tails. Dunsparce form very intricate subterranean nests, living in in colonies (called “broods”) numbering in the hundreds. Predators who are able to follow Dunsparce down their holes as they burrow to escape will be met with near-inescapable mazes of intersecting tunnels. In some regions, they even cohabitate peacefully with Diglett and share their tunnel networks. Dunsparce also have pairs of vestigial wing growths located on their backs. Though they are very weak, Dunsparce can be trained to float a few centimeters off the ground for several seconds by flapping these growths furiously. However, they are unable to actually take off and fly in the air, and are normally left very exhausted by the sheer effort required to even lift slightly off of the ground.","​Pokémon and all associated names and characters are trademarked and © 1995-2019 Nintendo. All non-original images are provided by Bulbapedia, © 1995-2019 Nintendo.No copyright infringement intended.","Normal"," 4'11\" | 1.5 m"," 30.9 lbs | 14.0 kg"," Serene Grace | Run Away |"," Rattled"," Field"," Field","

Gligar live in colonies of roughly a dozen individuals, all nesting on the same cliff. To hunt, Gligar soar in search of suitable prey, dropping down below when they find some. Then, they stretch out all of their limbs and dive at the faces of their victims. They latch on with their pincers and then use their stingers to inject poison and paralyze prey; then, they carry their meals back to their nests without resistance. Gligar can glide perfectly silently, so their victims often never see them coming. Trained Gligar are known to use this face-hugging habit as a form of affection with their trainers, sans the digging of claws into the flesh and the injection of poison into their trainers’ foreheads (though there have been some accidents reported).","Evolves into Gliscor when leveled up at night with a Razor Fang","Ground","/Flying"," 3'07\" | 1.1 m"," 142.9 lbs | 64.8 kg"," Hyper Cutter | Sand Veil |"," Bug"," Bug","

A common legend is that Onix living to be over 100 years will have experienced enough force to compress their bodies and become Steelix. In the wild, scientists believe that age has little to do with their evolutions; Onix evolve into Steelix as they eat through rock and absorb the iron within. Combined with intense pressure, their bodies eventually turn dense and metallic (such a process can be domestically replicated with Metal Coats). Their eyes are adapted to see in the dark, and their strong jaws can crunch through even the hardest boulders.

However, this in fact appears to be their instinctive reaction to a variety of different stimuli—fear and aggression, obviously, but also embarrassment, boredom, and general discomfort. Unfortunately for Snubbull, though, their expressions often drive other Pokémon away from them, leaving them sad and dejected. Snubbull are in fact affectionate and playful, which is why they are such popular pets. They are also easily scared or bullied; though they may bare their fangs to scare foes, they will flee and cower if they remain undeterred. Snubbull have keen senses of both smell and hearing; they often use these skills to track down “gifts” for their owners, ranging from food scraps to smaller Pokémon that they can pull with their mouths. Snubbull are heavy sleepers, dozing for 12 hours each day.

They avoid actual fighting unless absolutely necessary. Their bites, however, are in fact extremely powerful, strong enough to crush concrete. There is one situation, though, where Granbull will attack ferociously: when their loved ones are threatened. If their offspring, friends, or other that Granbull care for are threatened, they will attack in blind rages against the offenders. This curious aspect of their personalities--docile unless they sense threats--make them great guards within domestic homes. However, they are far less useful when defending properties, as they will avoid conflict if no lives are at stake. Still, their loyalty makes them popular pets.

To defend themselves, Qwilfish quickly swallow large amounts of water (2.6 gallons on average) and inflate themselves to up to twice their original sizes, hoping to match their foes in stature. In this state, they can launch the spikes off of their bodies to spear and inject enemies with their toxins. While inflated, however, Qwilfish experience much trouble swimming; though they are already not very good swimmers when deflated, they often will fail to move at all when fully inflated, simply floating along in the ocean currents until they expel all of their water. Qwilfish are territorial and will engage in inflation contests to see who can grow the largest.

Then, they throw their foes with forces capable of moving objects over a 100 times their body weight. Alternatively, they may charge at foes to frighten them before tossing them away. Heracross take strong pride in their horns. When fighting for territory, dominance or mates, Heracross will engage in duels, horns against horns.

They retract their claws while stalking prey to ensure they aren’t heard. They hunts in pairs for their favorite food: Pidgey eggs. First, one Sneasel will scare off the parents guarding the nests by silently approaching and then jumping out, extending its claws to scare them away. Then, the second will climb up the tree by digging its sharp claws into the bark, stealthily taking the eggs while the parents are startled. Breeders despise Sneasel for their egg-eating natures. Though cooperative when hunting, pairs are known to engage in disputes when it comes to sharing the haul. Sneasel are also known to occasionally scavenge, ripping pieces of flesh from the meals of other Pokémon. They are nocturnal, preferring to hunt in the cover of night. Sneasel are also cunning; they are known to closely observe enemies from the darkness to pinpoint their most vulnerable points before leaping out and digging their claws into those areas. Sneasel in pairs may gang up on single foes, using Beat Up to claw them into submission.","Evolves into Weavile when leveled up at night while holding a Razor Claw","Ice","/","Dark"," 2'11\" | 0.9 m"," 61.7 lbs | 28.0 kg"," Pickpocket"," Pickpocket","

"216","Teddiursa","216","Mountains, temperate and boreal forests","Teddiursa are almost always found with their hands held to their mouths. This is because they are infatuated with the taste of honey, enjoying it so much that they soaks their paws in the substance until they are saturated and they can lick honey from them at their leisure. Teddiursa actually create their own honey out of Beedrill pollen and fruit nectar. Each individual has its own taste preferences, and will have different “recipes” to suit their tastes. As such, no two sets of Teddiursa paws will taste the same. When they find honey in the wild, the crescent marks on their heads will glow. However, they do not immediately eat found honey. Instead, they store it in a variety of different hiding places. This practice helps them keep steady food supplies during cold winters when sustenance is scarce. Though Teddiursa don’t hibernate like Ursaring, they do become noticeably less active during the winter. In the wild, they will hole up in caves near one of their hidden stashes when the weather turns cold, waiting patiently for spring to arrive.","﻿Evolves into Ursaring at Lvl 30","Normal"," 2'00\" | 0.6 m"," 19.4 lbs | 8.8 kg"," Pickup | Quick Feet |"," "," Field"," Field","

They defend their domains fiercely, and will not hesitate to maul unwary trespassers. Generally, though, they will leave human travelers alone unless provoked. Exceptions arise during mating season, when Ursaring become highly aggressive and agitated. They also defend their young very ferociously, so travelers should be cautious of approaching young Teddiursa; their parents may in fact be nearby. Ursaring are highly competent at climbing trees. When searching for Berries--their favorite food--however, they prefer to simply snap trees in half and pick up fallen ones from the ground. They prefer to sleep high up in treetops. Ursaring also have keen senses of smell, able to distinguish most scents and find food buried deep underground. They are annual hibernators; in the winter, they lie dormant in their dens for months.

"218","Slugma","218","Volcanoes","Thin, transparent skin actually covers the bodies of Slugma. Instead of blood, however, their circulatory systems pump molten-hot lava to transport vital nutrients and minerals throughout their bodies. This lava bubbles out of small pores in their skin, leaving trails of the substance as they move around. Because of this unique system, Slugma can only live for extended periods of time in very warm areas, particularly volcanoes. Should they stop moving in cooler places, the lava within their bodies will begin to harden, become brittle, and crumble. The cooler Slugma are, the slower they will move, until they stop moving altogether. In areas where lava and magma are common, large groups of Slugma, sometimes numbering in the hundreds, can be seen congregating where the lava oozes out. In order to remain healthy, Slugma must dip themselves in lava or magma every so often to replenish the lava lost from traveling. Some Poké Marts sell a lava substitute specifically for Slugma and Magcargo, which is both nontoxic and safe to the touch.","﻿Evolves into Magcargo at Lvl 38","Fire"," 2'04\" | 0.7 m"," 77.2 lbs | 35.0 kg"," Magma Armor | Flame Body |"," "," Amorphous"," Amorphous","

"219","Magcargo","219","Volcanoes","Though the shells of Magcargo appear to be solid and rock-hard, they are in fact simply thin shells of cooled lava (like skins of sorts); they break at the slightest touch. Luckily, this does not harm Magcargo, as new lava will simply rise to the top and harden into new shells. Flames periodically spurt from small cracks in their shells; this is their way of disposing of waste, combusting it within their molten shells. Their bodies can reach temperatures of 18,000°F (10,000°C), hot enough to vaporize water on contact. When it rains, their mere presence can create thick fog that can blanket areas within seconds. Like Slugma, Magcargo gradually lose some of their lava and become smaller through simple locomotion as they leave trails. They can return to their original sizes by taking dips in magma pools. Trained Magcargo can also use the lava substitutes sold at some Poké Marts with no ill effects. Magcargo are almost only found in active volcanic craters, leading some scientists to believe that they adapted their molten bodies to cope with their environment.","﻿Evolves from Slugma at Lvl 38","Fire/","Rock"," 2'07\" | 0.8 m"," 121.3 lbs | 55.0 kg"," Magma Armor | Flame Body |","Weak Armor","Weak Armor","

In the wild, Swinub use their smell to forage for their favorite food—truffles. Swinub also have a talent for sniffing out concealed hot springs under ice. Though they themselves have little use for such springs, they do enjoy grazing on the plant life that grows around them. Ski resorts and inns often are built near areas with large numbers of Swinub, banking on the hopes that there are hot springs nearby to draw in tourists. Swinub have rather poor vision, relying mostly on their noses to find their way. When they smell something particularly enticing, they will dash quickly towards it, unaware of any obstacles in their way. Their thick coats of long fur keep them warm on the ice, insulating them from the cold. Although their favorite food is mushrooms, they aren’t very picky eaters and will consume nearly anything edible that they manage to locate with their noses.","Evolves into Piloswine at Lvl 33Piloswine evolves into Mamoswine when leveled up while knowing Ancient Power","Ice","/","","Ground",""," 14.3 lbs | 6.5 kg"," 14.3 lbs | 6.5 kg","

However, they also have highly developed senses of hearing. They can sound small grunts or snorts and then listen to the returning echoes to locate objects around them. If they sense disturbances, the hairs on their bodies will stand straight; they will also charge in the direction of the sound. Because of their poor vision, they may continue charging repeatedly in the same course, not noticing when foes have moved for a few seconds. Their tusks become harder after fresh snowfalls. Piloswine use these tusks to fend off enemies and dig up food from beneath the frost.

"222","Corsola","222","Tropical seas and reefs","Corsola are most well-known for their horns, which collectors prize as jewelry. Treated Corsola horns can refract light in the seven colors of the rainbow. In some regions, these harvested horns are considered fertility charms. Luckily, Corsola shed their horns periodically to grow new ones, giving collectors an ample supply of discarded horns to work with. This process can happen in as little as one to three nights. Corsola can only survive in pristine, warm waters. They migrate south as temperatures cools through the year. Corsola use their horns to filter water and obtain nutrients; in polluted or cold seas, their horns lose their color, become brittle, and disintegrate. Corsola live in colonies, shedding their horns to create natural reefs. Other Pokémon often make their homes in these reefs. Notably, Pacifidlog Town, Hoenn, is a village in the middle of the ocean built entirely on a Corsola colony. Corsola populations can be used as a water quality detector. If they begin to appear sickly, it is a sign that the water is dirty. Corsola also shed their horns as distractions against predators like Mareanie. Corsola populations in Alola, where Mareanie are most common, have stubbier horns as a result, though the tropical waters also make them much more vibrant and healthy overall.","Also see Galarian Corsola","Water","/","Rock"," 2'00\" | 0.6 m"," 11.0 lbs | 5.0 kg"," Regenerator"," Regenerator","

Instead, they use the suction pad-like fins on their heads to attach to the undersides of Mantine. There, they can consume scraps that drift past them while the Mantine are feeding. They will also defend the Mantine when they are endangered in order to keep their hosts safe. Once they are old enough to find food for themselves, they travel into freshwater rivers. Remoraid hunt by hiding just beneath the river’s surface and shooting out bullets of water at unsuspecting insects above. They can shoot up to 300 feet (91 m) away with amazing accuracy, even at moving targets. To do this, Remoraid squeeze their abdominal muscles to expel small pellets of water from their mouth. They also use this trick to escape from foes, propelling themselves backwards with the recoil. These “shots” even work underwater, striking foes from crevices on the riverbed or sea floor. As evolution approaches, Remoraid will swim downstream in large numbers back into the ocean, where they will stay for the rest of their lives. In Alola, the Remoraid population is fact entirely maritime, breeding and developing solely in the ocean; there, they are known as the \"snipers of the sea.\"","﻿Evolves into Octillery at Lvl 25","Water"," 2'00\" | 0.6 m"," 26.5 lbs | 12.0 kg"," Hustle | Sniper |"," Moody","Habitat","Habitat","

Then, when targets pass by, they squirt ink to blind them and drag them into their holes. Others prefer to bash prey with their rock-hard heads to stun them before capture. As a third option, some Octillery strangle their foes with their tentacles, which have powerful suction cups to prevent prey from escaping. If they grab victims that turn out to be too strong, though, they will squirt ink and attempt to escape. They can use Octazooka to blind foes and buy time to flee. It has recently been discovered that this ink also contains a compound that dulls olfactory senses, hindering predators that hunt by smell as well as sight. In some regions, Octillery ink is also used as a culinary ingredient and food dye. Octillery instinctually hide in the crevices of boulders, nesting in these cracks and even stealing the nests of other Octillery if they are in more favorable positions. Octillery will bash heads with each other to fight for nests; these fights can be dirty, involving copious amounts of ink and tentacles.","﻿Evolves from Remoraid at Lvl 25","Water"," 2'11\" | 0.9 m"," 62.8 lbs | 28.5 kg"," Suction Cups | Sniper |"," Moody","Habitat","Habitat","

While females stay with their young to keep watch, males spend the day looking for food, which they roll up and store within their sack-like tails to bring home. Delibird are very kind to strangers; if they comes across lost Pokémon or trainers, they won’t hesitate to share some of their food with them. Many hikers in near-death situations can recount being saved by generous Delibird. Delibird are also curious Pokémon; besides food, they also collect pretty, strange, and sometimes even dangerous objects within their tails. They will gladly share their loot with others--for example, giving lost hikers compasses to help them find their way. Because they give away so much, though, they are constantly waddling about in search of more food. Their generous reputations have made them symbols of various holidays centered around gift-giving. As Delibird are omnivorous, however, their definition of \"food\" when gifting can sometimes include insects or other unusual foodstuffs. When threatened, Delibird defend themselves by using Present, chucking the contents of their tails at attackers. Projectiles include food, rocks, and even explosives--whatever Delibird have found on their travels. In a flock, the Delibird with the largest tail is the leader.","​Pokémon and all associated names and characters are trademarked and © 1995-2019 Nintendo. All non-original images are provided by Bulbapedia, © 1995-2019 Nintendo.No copyright infringement intended.","Ice","/","Flying"," 2'11\" | 0.9 m"," 35.3 lbs | 16.0 kg"," Insomnia"," Insomnia","

They are usually swim slowly, gliding gently through the water and eating anything that happens to float into their mouths. However, they are able to reach very high speeds; in fact, one can sometimes see small schools of Mantine accelerating just under the water’s surface before leaping out and becoming airborne. Mantine can soar for over 300 feet (91 meters) in the way. Though they appear smooth, their bodies actually feel coarse, having accumulated detritus while flying through the water. This is why it is healthy for Mantine to have Remoraid attached to them in the wild; they protect the Mantine from parasites and disease and keep them from being weighed down by detritus. In Alola, Mantine surfing is a popular pastime, and the Pokémon is a popular symbol of the island chain.","﻿Evolves from Mantyke when leveled up with Remoraid in the party","Water","/Flying"," 6'11\" | 2.1 m"," 485.0 lbs | 220.0 kg"," Swift Swim | Water Absorb |"," Water 1"," Water 1","

They will rip off wings and feathers from foes with their sharp beaks or talons to send them plummeting to the ground. Skarmory are known to kidnap small, defenseless Pokémon from their trainers or parents in hopes of luring larger prey seeking to retrieve them back to their nests. They have even been observed tearing off the limbs of weaker creatures or chasing them off cliffs simply for fun.

Then, they work together to corner their prey; they have demonstrated to be intelligent enough to form complex, unique strategies for catching prey depending on their surroundings and the skills of their quarry. Houndour demonstrate some of the most efficient teamwork in the Pokémon world. Around dawn, packs will howl ominously at the moon to indicate to other nearby packs of the boundaries of their territories. Unlike most pack hunters, Houndour packs have no true leaders.

Indeed, the howls of Houndoom are so discomforting that many forest Pokémon will instinctively return to their shelters upon hearing them. Houndoom packs hunt by encircling an area and then setting it ablaze. They then go after prey flushed out of hiding, working together to corner and defeat them. Like Houndour, Houndoom packs share their kills evenly; the leader receives the same portion as the lowliest pack member. The fire that Houndoom breathe, in addition to smelling strongly of sulfur, contains a mix of toxins that cause a searing pain that lasts beyond the burns themselves.

While this fact is not true, Kingdra have been known to create whirlpools when they “yawn”; by quickly sucking in large amounts of water from beneath the ocean’s surface, they can generate vortexes that pull down food for them to consume. Occasionally, unfortunate ships are also caught in these whirlpools. Kingdra become particularly active during and after storms, awakening in search of prey displaced by rough waters. Kingdra capitalize on these times, as Pokémon frantically swimming in search of shelter are more likely to get caught by their vortexes. After satisfying meals, Kingdra become dormant for up to months at a time; they only need to eat a few times a year, thanks to their rather inactive lifestyles; they sleep the rest of the time (except during mating season, at least).","Horsea evolves into Seadra at Lvl 37Evolves from Seadra through trade with a Dragon Scale","Water","/","Dragon"," 5'11\" | 1.8 m"," 335.1 lbs | 152.0 kg"," Damp"," Damp","

They dry themselves off in the sun over the course of the day. Phanpy are very affectionate and playful Pokémon. Though small, they are strong enough to carry adult humans on their backs. They will often “play” with their trainers by charging into them, but the force of ​their impacts can be enough to send their trainers flying. Alternatively, they will knock things around with their trunk for fun; this pastime generally can be very destructive to the personal belongings of humans.

While curled up, their hides can withstand most attacks without being scratched. They are strong enough to haul dump trucks and can ram foes with enough force to level buildings and knock down trees. Donphan are often employed by construction companies to flatten swathes of land before building. Disaster relief teams also use them to clear out rocks and mudslides from roads. Once they start rolling, Donphan have great difficulty stopping; they can angle their tusks downwards while spinning to use them as brakes, but this wears down on them greatly.

However, keeping clean is important to Smoochum because their skin is very sensitive; even mild irritants such as stray dirt can cause them to break out in rashes. Their lips are particularly delicate; they use them as their main method of gathering information about their surroundings. When they come across something foreign, their first instinct is to run up to it (though they are rather clumsy and often fall) and kiss it. This is also how it cleans objects prior to touching them, smooching them and then licking the dirt off of its lips. Smoochum can distinguish and remember thousands of different objects based on their textures and taste from their lips alone. They then categorize these things into what they like and dislike. As they walk, they bob their heads back and forth constantly, as if they were about to kiss someone. They dislike heat and will become cranky and irritable when uncomfortably warm.

"239","Elekid","239","Power plants, fields","Elekid love to play outside in thunderstorms. They wind their arms to build up charge; however, because they cannot hold much electricity at once, most of the built up power is dissipated immediately. This is done by the two prongs on their heads. As Elekid spin their arms, the area between their prongs will glow a light neon blue, transferring excess charge to the surrounding air. Elekid also tire easily and will stop to rest between wind-ups. If any part of their bodies touch metal, all of their electricity will discharge, forcing them to wind arms again. Elekid have a weak spot right between their prongs. However, a weak but potentially painful electric current runs between them, deterring attackers from striking this area. Even when resting, this spot remains charged, warding off foes who may otherwise see tired Elekid as easy targets. Elekid can quickly discharge what little electricity they can store in short, concentrated bursts to attack, but must recharge after each release. They compete for electricity in urban areas alongside the likes of Togedemaru and Dedenne. These Pokémon seem to cheer up when they hear the sound of a crack of thunder; this even applies when the sound is merely a recording rather than the real thing.","Evolves into Electabuzz at Lvl 30Electabuzz evolves into Electivire through trade with an Electirizer","Electric"," 2'00\" | 0.6 m"," 51.8 lbs | 23.5 kg"," Static |"," Vital Spirit"," Undiscovered"," Undiscovered","

They can evaporate small puddles merely by standing near them. Their blood is magma-like; as they breathe, they let out tiny embers from their mouths and nostrils. Their health can be gauged from the color of their flames. Magby that spit out yellow or orange fire are healthy and in good shape. Those that exhale flames that are dull or are mixed with black smoke, however, are likely fatigued or ill. Magby that can only spew out smoke are critically hurt and should be taken to Pokémon Centers immediately. They make their homes directly in the craters of active volcanoes, right at the edges of lava pools. It is widely believed that if many Magby begin to cluster in the same crater within a short period of time, then the volcano in question will erupt very soon. While this has not yet been proven, scientists are currently looking into this phenomenon as a possible way to predict eruptions in densely-populated areas before they occur. Magby are also known for their use in ceramics; a famous Johto potter uses a Magby to fire his kiln.","Evolves into Magmar at Lvl 30Evolves into Magmortar through trade with an Magmarizer","Fire"," 2'04\" | 0.7 m"," 47.2 lbs | 21.4 kg"," Flame Body |"," Vital Spirit"," Undiscovered"," Undiscovered","

"241","Miltank","241","Pastures, plains, farms and ranches","Miltank are common on farms and ranches, where they are raised for their highly nutritious milk. Because Miltank milk contains so many vitamins, nutrients, and minerals (and calories), it is often touted as a “cure-all” drink for the sick. Children are also encouraged to drink Miltank milk with the promise of growing up strong and healthy. Miltank can produce over 5 gallons of milk a day. Their milk has a naturally rich and sweet taste, richer and sweeter when sourced from Miltank raised in rich pastures, and is often made into yogurt for those who cannot consume it naturally. It should be noted that consuming too much Miltank milk in a short period of time can result in an upset stomach. Curiously, when around young kids or Pokémon, Miltank will produce more milk than usual. Farmers use this to their advantage, opening up their farms as petting zoos and encouraging parents to take their kids to visit. Their sturdy bodies make them well-suited for children. Milking a Miltank oddly benefits from a musical background; one must pull on its udders rhythmically to extract milk efficiently. The most common brand of commercial milk is Moomoo Milk, made from the Miltank of MooMoo Farms on Johto Route 39.","​Pokémon and all associated names and characters are trademarked and © 1995-2019 Nintendo. All non-original images are provided by Bulbapedia, © 1995-2019 Nintendo.No copyright infringement intended.","Normal"," 3'11\" | 1.2 m"," 164.4 lbs | 75.5 kg"," Thick Fat | Scrappy |"," Sap Sipper"," Field"," Field","

Blissey will often share their eggs with complete strangers who happen to be down on their luck. A single bite of their eggs, which have enough vitamins and minerals to feed a person for a whole day, can immediately lift spirits and ease illnesses. Consuming whole eggs will compel people or Pokémon to act just as kindly as Blissey to others until the nutrients from the eggs pass through their systems. Unsurprisingly, ethically-sourced eggs are a huge delicacy due to their rarity and are exorbitantly expensive. Because of their compassionate natures, Blissey are often found working in Pokémon Centers alongside their pre-evolutions Chansey; in fact, they are more commonly found in Centers than in the wild, where they are exceedingly rare (even more so than the already-elusive Chansey). Blissey will work tirelessly to heal the sick and weary, not being able to rest until their patients are at the very least in stable conditions.","Happiny evolves into Chansey when leveled while holding an Oval StoneEvolves from Chansey with high happiness","Normal"," 4'11\" | 1.5 m"," 103.2 lbs | 46.8 kg"," Natural Cure | Serene Grace |"," Healer"," Fairy"," Fairy","

Its bark can echo for miles into the distance, creating a shock wave akin to the sound of thunder. The rain cloud-like fur on its back stores electrical energy; it can shoot lightning and create storms with this fur. As it runs, it also charges this cloud with electricity from the surrounding air. Raikou is one of the three legendary beasts mentioned in the legend of the Brass Tower. In the tale, three Pokemon were trapped inside the tower in Johto when it was struck by lightning; the building burned down and killed all three Pokemon before being put out by a fortuitous rain. A mysterious bird Pokemon flew over the tower, reviving the three deceased as the legendary beasts. Raikou is said to represent the lightning that set the tower ablaze, given electrical powers from the bolt that struck the building.

As it runs, the billowing smoke-like fur on its back dissipates its energy, heating up the land around it. Entei is said to have the passion and power of an active volcano. Some say that every time it roars, a volcano erupts somewhere around the globe. Like its brethren Raikou and Suicune, Entei constantly roams about. It rarely stops for even a moment to rest, let alone settle in a single location for an extended period of time. In the Brass Tower myth of the three legendary beasts, Entei represents the fire that burned down the building and killed the three Pokémon trapped inside. Some contend that before being resurrected by the mysterious bird Pokémon, Entei was in fact originally a Flareon; this idea is based on the fact that both Entei and Flareon are closely affiliated with fire.","A legendary beast, alongside Raikou and Suicune​Also see Ho-oh","Fire"," 6'11\" | 2.1 m"," 436.5 lbs | 198.0 kg"," Pressure |"," Inner Focus"," Undiscovered"," Undiscovered","

It is said if one suddenly feels the northern wind blowing out of nowhere, it is a sign that Suicune will soon appear. Suicune can run across water; any lake or river that it touches immediately becomes clean and potable, no matter how murky it was originally. The ribbons on its body ripple in the direction of the north wind, indicating where it will be headed next. In the Brass Tower myth of the three legendary beasts, Suicune represents the rain that eventually quenched the burning building after it had trapped and killed three Pokémon inside of it.

"246","Larvitar","246","Mountains, badlands","Mother Tyranitar will lay their eggs individually underground, covering each with large, mountainous piles of dirt. Upon hatching, infant Larvitar instinctively begin eating the soil around them, constantly consuming dirt without rest. They will eventually manage to burrow their way through the entire mountain, a process that can take anywhere from weeks to months depending on how much dirt they were buried under. It is only upon finishing their meals that they see their mothers’ faces--as well as sunlight for the first time, which they often find blinding). Once Larvitar reach the surface, however, they almost immediately begin preparing for evolution. Using the large storages of energy gained from their giant meals, Larvitar will find crevices in mountainsides to hide. There, they will pupate as they evolve into Pupitar. Trained Larvitar must be fed constantly with dirt in order to remain healthy; in the wild, they will do almost nothing other than eat before evolution, and trained ones will behave no differently. Consequently, raising Larvitar often becomes a very time-consuming--and pricey--affair.","Evolves into Pupitar at Lvl 30Pupitar evolves into Tyranitar at Lvl 55","﻿","Rock","/","Ground"," 2'00\" | 0.6 m"," Guts |"," Guts |","

When threatened, they will thrash about violently in hopes of bludgeoning or piercing foes with various parts of their bodies. Even if they fail to make contact, their sudden movements often topple unstable portions of their mountainous homes, trapping foes in rockslides. Such occurrences don’t harm Pupitar; their shells are as hard as sheet rock. Additionally, the carapces of these Pokémon contain highly pressurized gas. By venting this gas out of their shells in a controlled manner, they can propel themselves at high speeds towards attackers. The force of these launches can dent solid steel without even scratching their shells. They can also use this gas to find new places to hide. However, Pupitar cannot replenish this gas once released, so they do not practice this method of defense and locomotion often. Inside their shells, new arms and legs are beginning to develop as these Pokémon prepare for evolution. Pupitar do not eat, relying on the energy they had stored as Larvitar for survival. Even when not in danger, these Pokémon will thrash about in order to relieve themselves of stored gases, leading to the common belief that they are temperamental and impatient for evolution.","Evolves from Larvitar at Lvl 30Evolves into Tyranitar at Lvl 55","Rock","/","Ground"," 3'11\" | 1.2 m"," 335.1 lbs | 152.0 kg"," Monster"," Monster","

Their armor is nearly impenetrable, making it difficult to stop these Pokemon when they are enraged; this makes Tyranitar eager to fight others, as they are unlikely to get hurt. They can level entire landscapes, forcing cartographers to redraw maps after their rampages. Even when not angered, Tyranitar can still be destructive; they are known to cause earthquakes as they topple mountains while searching for nest-building locations. Though powerful, wild Tyranitar are also rare. Furthermore, they general live in remote areas away from most people, and do not intentionally approach foes that they do not see as comparable competitors. However, there has been one notable incident of a Tyranitar wreaking havoc on a large urban city. The cost of damage was in the billions, and it took days for the Pokémon to be stopped. Since then, most cities located near Tyranitar territory have developed defense systems against them. Water is one of the few reliable deterrents against Tyranitar, so moats are a common choice for these cities.","Larvitar evolves into Pupitar at Lvl 30Evolves from Pupitar at Lvl 55​Can Mega Evolve into Mega Tyranitar","﻿","Rock","/","Dark"," 6'07\" | 2.0 m"," Sand Stream |"," Sand Stream |","

It is known as the “guardian of the ocean,” defending the sea from anything seeking to harm marine life or sully pristine waters. However, it is also believed to be a benevolent Pokémon, calming rough storms to allow the passage of benign boats and ships. Lugia is said to control the three legendary birds: Articuno, Zapdos, and Moltres. In the Silver Wing myth, Lugia is thought to have shed a single feather on each of three mysterious eggs. One landed on a frozen egg on a frigid northern ice cap--Articuno. Another fell onto a desolate island during a storm, landing on an egg just as it was struck by lightning--Zapdos. The last descended into an island volcano on an egg submerged in magma--Moltres.

In the story, Ho-oh used to perch regularly on the Bell Tower (also known as the Tin Tower) in Ecruteak City, Johto. During a storm, however, lightning struck the Bell Tower’s sister building, the Brass Tower. The structure burned down, killing three Pokémon trapped inside. Ho-oh was deeply saddened by the horrible tragedy, and, seeking to undo the damage, resurrected the three deceased Pokémon as the legendary beasts: Raikou, Entei, and Suicune.

It can even revive dead plant life simply through its mere presence. Though Celebi is believed to be able to visit any place and time in history, it only appears deep in forests, and even then only during peaceful times. Years can go by without a single sighting reported because of this. Some believe that sighting Celebi is an indication of a bright future ahead for the whole world. As it travels across time, it is fabled to leave behind mysterious eggs brought back from the future in its wake. Celebi is said to use its powers to protect the forests in which it dwells. It will influence events in the past to stop harmful ones from occurring in the future. Celebi is believed by some scientists to be able to exist in multiple time periods at the same time, though this claim is obviously rather difficult to prove.","​Pokémon and all associated names and characters are trademarked and © 1995-2019 Nintendo. All non-original images are provided by Bulbapedia, © 1995-2019 Nintendo.No copyright infringement intended.","","Grass","/","Psychic",""," 11.0 lbs | 5.0 kg"," 11.0 lbs | 5.0 kg","

Treecko never panic, even when faced with stronger foes, and will stand their ground no matter what. Though rare in the wild, they can be occasionally found high up in the branches of tall trees. They make their nests there to stay away from most predators. When their trees are threatened, Treecko will leap down and ferociously defend their homes. They are adept climbers, equipped with microscopic hooks on the bottom of their feet that enable them to hold onto slick surfaces. Treecko slam foes with their tails to attack. They also use them to measure humidity and predict the next day’s weather. Treecko are known to stare down foes much larger themselves and provoke them into combat; however, they will never back down from a fight.

In the dense forests in which they reside, Grovyle can leap from tree branch to tree branch with ease, gliding between them using the leaves on their arms for aid. This ability enables them to both escape from predators and sneak up on prey. Grovyle have extremely powerful thigh muscles that allow them to perform such jumping feats. In addition to helping them in the air, their foliage also helps them camouflage in the trees. The long leaves on their heads are also sensitive to flowing air currents, allowing them to adjust their trajectories in the air to land exactly where they want to. They are so skilled at jumping, in fact, that some say nothing can catch a fleeing Grovyle in its natural forest habitat. When threatened, Grovyle first confound their foes by swiftly leaping from tree to tree, obscuring their true locations.

Sceptile are extremely protective of their territories; they keep close watches on intruders and will not hesitate to strike should they feel their homes are threatened. They also take extraordinary care of the trees within their territories as well, making sure that each gets enough water and sunlight. The seeds on their backs are filled with nutrients and minerals that they use to help struggling saplings in their forests.

Torchic have some trouble walking and will always be a few steps behind their trainers, wobbling around with unsteady steps. They are also afraid of the dark, and will begin crying if left alone at night. Many trainers find their behavior cute, however, and thus choose Torchic as their starter Pokémon in Hoenn. Their internal flame sacs can heat up to temperatures of 1,800°F (1,000°C), hot enough to scorch foes black when they attack.Their feathers are soft and downy, almost like stuffed dolls. Trainers who have raised Torchic describe embracing them as “like hugging fluffy bottles of hot water;” luckily for Torchic, who are often afraid of sleeping alone, their likeness to warm stuffed plushes also means that most trainers have little problem sleeping alongside them.

However, their dedication and practice pays off; thanks to their training, they can dole out up to 10 kicks a second. In combat, they will not relent until their foes have surrendered. Combusken also spew flames from their mouths in battle. When fighting, their bodies heat up; they release this excess heat in the form of flames. Combusken are also known to use their distinctive cries to intimidate and bewilder foes. Watching two trained Combusken fight was a popular pastime among trainers in older times.

In battle, flames erupt from their wrists and envelop their knuckles, allowing them to pummel foes with fiery punches that can scorch and burn. The stronger their foes are, the stronger these flames burn, and the more determined Blaziken are to defeat them. Their ankles can also similarly ignite, enabling them to land fiery kicks as well as punches if necessary. Every few years, their feathers burn off from repeated exposure to fire. However, newer, softer ones regrow in their place.

The orange growths on the sides of their heads are actually gills, allowing Mudkip to breathe underwater; on land, they breathe using their mouths. They use their tail fins to accelerate themselves through the water. Their head fins, on the other hand, are primarily tasked with observation. These fins can sense both air and water currents, letting Mudkip navigate the murky waters they call home without actually being able to see their surroundings. Mudkip sleep by burying themselves in the mud. They spend roughly equal time on land and in the water, but must keep their skin moist so they don’t dry out and become lethargic.

Curiously enough, they can actually use their powerful hind legs to travel faster through mud than through clean water. These strengthened hind legs also enable them to walk bipedally, unlike Mudkip. In battle, Marshtomp attempt to lure foes into the mire rather than step out of it themselves, as they can easily overpower most foes on their home turfs with the move Muddy Water. Marshtomp burrow in the mud to sleep. Individuals who live near the ocean sometimes emerge at low tide to play on the beach, while those inland may splash around at the water’s edge.

As omnivores, Poochyena can eat nearly anything; in fact, they often will try to bite anything that moves, including inorganic objects like cars and bicycles. Running from aggressive Poochyena will only encourage them to begin chasing. Instead, attempting to intimidate them by staring them down and feigning lunges is a far more effective tactic. As the saying goes, they are “all bark and no bite.” They will cower and flee when confronted, even when against smaller or weaker foes.

"263","Zigzagoon","263","Woodlands, grasslands, fields, cities","Zigzagoon, as their names suggest, tend to travel in zigzag fashions, wandering left and right as they explore their surroundings. This is largely due to their extremely curious natures; Zigzagoon have the urge to examine almost everything around them, walking back and forth as they attempt to catch glimpses of all of their surroundings. Oftentimes, they will use their keen senses of smell to locate items hidden in the grass, holding their noses to the ground and sniffing as they zigzag towards concealed objects. Because of this, Zigzagoon trails and footprints are very easy to identify. Their hairs are very bristly; they will rub their backs against the bark of trees to mark their territories. As omnivores, Zigzagoon will gladly consume most food that they come across. However, they seem to have a particular affinity for Oran Berries, and will hoard them impulsively. Zigzagoon dislike fighting and will flee when intimidated to avoid conflict. When cornered, they will play dead in hopes of being left alone by their attackers.","﻿Evolves into Linoone at Lvl 20Also see Galarian Zigzagoon","Normal"," 1'04\" | 0.4 m"," 38.6 lbs | 17.5 kg"," Pickup | Gluttony |"," "," Field"," Field","

They always run at full speed--60 mph (100 km/h)--and can only turn at 90° angles; Additionally, they must come to full stops before turning. Consequently, roads with gentle curves are rather challenging for these Pokémon. Like Zigzagoon, Linoone are omnivores. They rely primarily on surprise to capture prey, however; though they are indeed fast, their inability to turn makes it easy for targets to escape should they notice Linoone before being attacked. Linoone are also surprisingly adept swimmers, capable of leaping into the water mid-charge to capture aquatic prey. They have an affinity for round objects, which they will store in their expandable cheek pouches to take back to their nests. They hoard these objects in secret stashes. Consequently, Linoone will often be found holding globular Oran Berries (like their pre-evolutions) or occasionally more misshapen, but still recognizably round, Sitrus Berries in their cheeks. Linoone fur is prized for its strength and flexibility, commonly finding use in shaving brushes.","﻿Evolves from Zigzagoon at Lvl 20Also see Galarian Linoone","Normal"," 1'08\" | 0.5 m"," 71.6 lbs | 32.5 kg"," Pickup | Gluttony |"," "," Field"," Field","

"265","Wurmple","265","Forests","Wurmple primarily defend themselves using the two spikes on their rears. When in trouble, they can secrete poison out of these barbs and raise their hindquarters up to deter potential predators--specifically the Swellow and Starly who consider Wurmple their preferred prey. Alternatively, they can shoot a white fluid out of their mouths that turns sticky in contact with air--silk. The substance entangles and inhibits predators, giving Wurmple time to flee. Wurmple feed on tree sap; they use their spikes to peel back bark and feed on the exposed resin that oozes out. They spend most of their time on trees. The bottoms of their feet have tiny suction cups strong enough to allow them to inch upside-down even on glass surfaces. Wurmple are voracious eaters, as they need to store a good deal of energy for evolution. It is believed that a Wurmple’s personality is the primary determining factor in its evolutionary path. Outgoing, cheerful Wurmple tend to evolve into Silcoon, while introverted, downcast ones seem to evolve into Cascoon.","﻿Evolves into Silcoon or Cascoon randomly at Lvl 7Silcoon evolves into Beautifly at Lvl 10Cascoon evolves into Dustox at Lvl 10","Bug"," 1'00\" | 0.3 m"," 7.9 lbs | 3.6 kg"," Shield Dust |"," "," Bug"," Bug","

Should they evolve into Silcoon, they will choose spots that receive lots of sunlight. Silcoon attach themselves to nearby branches or leaves with copious amounts of silk to prevent themselves from accidentally being dislodged from their shelters. Silcoon do not move often, but luckily for them, they do not need to eat; they store all the energy they need to survive as Wurmple. They have been known, however, to spin silk in such a manner that morning dew or rain water will flow down to them and help slake their thirst. When in danger, Silcoon rely on their tough casings to protect themselves. Though capable of movement (albeit slowly), they rarely actually do so, as they need to save as much energy as they can for evolution. Their activity tends to be limited to concealing themselves with leaves to hide from predators. Despite their immobility, however, studies show that Silcoon are keenly aware of their surroundings.","﻿Evolves from Wurmple randomly at Lvl 7​Evolves into Beautifly at Lvl 10​Wurmple can also evolve into Cascoon randomly at Lvl 7Cascoon evolves into Dustox at Lvl 10","Research Notes","","Bug"," 2'00\" | 0.6 m"," 22.0 lbs | 10.0 kg"," Bug"," Bug","

People often leave out potted plants with hopes of catching sight of visiting Beautifly. Despite their appearance, however, Beautifly can in fact be very aggressive. Disturbing feeding Beautifly will anger them and cause them to chase offenders while jabbing them sharply with their needle-like proboscises. Though they prefer pollen, they are also content with stabbing and draining the body fluids of other prey if food is scarce. During mating season, Beautifly of both genders will attack members of the same sex ruthlessly in competition for mates. Their viciousness, however, is largely unknown to the public, who often see them as symbols of love, beauty, and innocence. They are solitary and territorial Pokémon, only coming together during the spring mating season. During this time, Beautifly attacks also become more common, as the Pokémon both become more aggressive and numerous when mating, riding the spring winds into densely-populated areas.","﻿Wurmple evolves into Silcoon or Cascoon randomly at Lvl 7​Evolves from Silcoon at Lvl 10Cascoon evolves into Dustox at Lvl 10","Research Notes","","","Bug","/Flying"," 62.6 lbs | 28.4 kg"," 62.6 lbs | 28.4 kg","

However, they harden over time; when they begin to crack, their owners are close to evolution. The insides of their cocoons are very hot, as their cells are creating and storing energy to evolve. Cascoon are largely immobile, conserving as much energy as they can. Even when attacked, they remains motionless; however, they are still entirely conscious. In fact, studies show that Cascoon can remember the pain they endured and the faces of every one of their attackers. It is said that upon evolution into Dustox, they will seek revenge on all of those that had harmed them. The “spikes” on their cocoons are actually remnants of the silk they used to attach themselves to leaves and branches. Trained Cascoon (and Silcoon, for that matter) often lack these protrusions, as they likely did not hide in trees like their wild brethren.","﻿Evolves from Wurmple randomly at Lvl 7Evolves into Dustox at Lvl 10​Wurmple can also evolve into Silcoon randomly at Lvl 7Silcoon evolves into Beautifly at Lvl 10","Research Notes","","Bug"," 2'04\" | 0.7 m"," 25.4 lbs | 11.5 kg"," Bug"," Bug","

When Dustox flap their wings, they let loose clouds of fine, toxic powder strong enough to make pro wrestlers sick. They uses this in their defense, flapping and letting loose the dust to deter enemies. Dustox are attracted to bright lights, a problem for many urban areas; they will often congregate along boulevards and avenues, attracted there by street lamps and large trees. In their wake, Dustox swarms leave behind lines of barren branches and large clouds of toxic powder. Though they will consume nearly any variety of leaves (even some toxic ones, which may have to do with their Poison-typings), Dustox have shown a particular affinity for the leaves of Persim trees, even sometimes feeding on the Berries themselvse.

"270","Lotad","270","Ponds","Lotad are amphibious Pokémon, but they spend virtually all of their time in the water. They primarily photosynthesize for energy, though they also feed on aquatic weeds from time to time as well. Because of their reliance on photosynthesis, studies have shown that the leaves on their heads have been growing steadily larger in surface area with every passing generation; many hypothesize that the reason why Lotad rarely exercise their terrestrial abilities is because these leaves have become too heavy for efficient land travel. Despite this, Lotad will occasionally leave the water to search for new ponds if their original ones become polluted; they must drink clean water routinely to prevent their pads from wilting. Lotad camouflage themselves underwater, leaving only their leaves exposed to blend in with lily pads. These leaves are buoyant enough to suspend them perfectly in this fashion. Lotad are docile and easygoing Pokémon. They are known to carry smaller Pokémon that can’t swim over bodies of water, ferrying them over on their broad pads.","﻿Evolves into Lombre at Lvl 14Lombre evolves into Ludicolo with a Water Stone","Water","/Grass"," 1'08\" | 0.5 m"," 5.7 lbs | 2.6 kg"," Swift Swim | Rain Dish |","Own Tempo","Own Tempo","

On occasion, they may even pose as human children, confusing tired travelers with their similar silhouettes in the moonlight. Their skin is coated with a slippery, slimy mucus to keep them moist outside of the water. Touching their skin causes what is described as a “horribly unpleasant” sensation. Lombre spend most of the day near the water’s edge, sleeping on beds of reeds. They feed on aquatic moss growing on underwater rocks and also catch and eat fish. It is widely known that Lombre have a very strong liking of Spelon Berries; in fact, many fishermen will carry some of the Berries when fishing in Lombre territory to pacify these Pokémon and keep them from playing tricks on them.

When there isn’t music, Ludicolo will seek to create their own rhythms, employing a variety of materials found in their habitats. Tools ranging from stone “drums” to reed pipes have been found near ponds where Ludicolo dwell. In battle, they will play these instruments and dance to the melodies produced in order to power up their attacks. Oftentimes, the sight of dancing Ludicolo is enough to placate aggressors, who may even begin dancing as well.

Curiously, Seedot enjoy scaring other Pokémon. Wild Pidgey and Tailow often mistake them for real acorns, and Seedot delight in startling them by suddenly jumping up at the last second. They may also drop prematurely from their branches to scare unsuspecting people and Pokémon below. Strong winds can also dislodge Seedot before they are ready.

Regardless of how they predict actions, Shiftry can uncannily prepare themselves from most attacks. Popular folklore says that the only way to defeat them is to do so unwittingly; for example, trying to attack a Shiftry but missing and striking a tree instead, hitting it on the nose--its weak point--with the dislodged shrapnel. In this manner, the Shiftry would be unable to predict the hit because there was no intent in the action.

They are clumsy when it comes to flapping, so they usually glide instead. Their beaks are adept at catching fish near the water’s surface, though they can also dive if necessary. Wingull have a habit of bringing back food and objects they find and hiding them near their nests. This behavior increases as winter approaches, when they begin storing more food than they eat. Scientists are not sure why Wingull do this, as they do not migrate or hibernate and continue searching for food during the winter despite already having hoards. Some have hypothesized that the storages are intended to attract mates, who use the stashes to gauge how well their creators can catch food. When Wingull rest, they fold their wings inwards, forming “M” shapes.

They can’t sit still for a single second; ceasing movement will stress them out greatly and make them ill. Vigoroth feel a constant urge to go on rampages thanks to their boundless energy. Consequently, they also feel a never-ending desire for food; even when eating, however, they keep moving. Vigoroth don’t sleep, instead spending all of their time running about aimlessly. As they run, they will spin and flail their arms about wildly to burn off more energy, destroying much of what is in their way. Vigoroth defend Slaking colonies in troops, putting their endless energy to use. They chase off intruders from their colonies in large numbers; oftentimes, up to a dozen Vigoroth will pursue single threats until sufficiently far away. Vigoroth are also in charge of foraging. They gather large amounts of food to bring back home, eating constantly as they travel. Whatever they don’t finish eating is piled up at the center of their nests, where their brethren can then feast.","Evolves from Slakoth at Lvl 18Evolves into Slaking at Lvl 36","Normal"," 4'07\" | 1.4 m"," 102.5 lbs | 46.5 kg"," Vital Spirit"," Field","Habitat","Habitat","

Consequently, rings over a yard (.9 meters) in diameter of barren earth are telltale signs that a Slaking is nearby. Slaking will only move, and reluctantly so, once all the food around them is cleared out. In a colony, there is only one Slaking; should a Vigoroth evolve inthe group, it must battle the current Slaking for dominance. Losing individuals are exiled to start new colonies elsewhere in the forest. The head Slaking of a group has the sole job of reproduction; Vigoroth are in charge of gathering food, defending the territory, and raising Slakoth. However, in the rare event that intruders manage to defeat the Vigoroth, Slaking will rise and show their true might. Standing on their hind legs, they will unleash all of the power they had saved up while lounging around in a single, devastating blow that can easily level entire swathes of forest.

Since they rarely venture aboveground, their eyes are very poorly developed, making them virtually blind. Nincada navigate using their antennae to probe their surroundings. They search for tree roots, which they claws into to suck out moisture, nutrients, and sap. They can spend as long as 10 years underground, making their nests between the thick roots of large trees so they do not have to travel far to find food. Nincada will use their claws to dig out tunnels connecting their nests to other important areas: water sources, other trees, and exit tunnels to the surface should their nests flood from rain. Nincada need to molt their exoskeletons to continue growing. When molting, they will travel up their exit tunnels onto the trunks of the trees they are nesting in. They do this at night, after the sun has gone down. When they near evolution, they molt for a final time, but do not return to their nests afterwards.","Evolves into Ninjask at Lvl 20Shedinja will appear in the party when Nincada evolves into Ninjask if there is an empty Poké Ball in the bag","Bug","/","Ground"," 1'08\" | 0.5 m"," 12.1 lbs | 5.5 kg"," "," ","

Because of this, in the past people used to believe that they were invisible. Oftentimes, the only way one can tell that Ninjask are nearby is by the high-pitched buzzing sound they make while flying and the gusts of wind felt by their passing. Ninjask are notoriously difficult to train, refusing orders and emitting their incessantly loud buzzing to annoy their trainers. It is said that trainers must prove their worth to their Ninjask through demonstrations of physical strength, agility, and dexterity in order for them to be deemed worthy of obedience. Listening to their buzzing for extended periods of time can cause headaches, adding to the difficulty of training them. However, those who earn their respect are rewarded with Pokémon so quick that they can dodge virtually any attack through the sheer virtue of their agility. Their favorite food is tree sap; Ninjask can be seen congregating around exposed sap on tree bark, one of the only times they can be seen remaining still.","Evolves from Nincada at Lvl 20Shedinja will appear in the party when Ninjask evolves from Ninjask if there is an empty Poké Ball in the bag","Bug","/","","Flying",""," 26.5 lbs | 12.0 kg"," 26.5 lbs | 12.0 kg","

Many consider Shedinja to be the the final molts of Nincada prior to their evolutions, reanimated by mysterious spirits. Staring into the holes in their backs (where, if Shedinja are indeed shed skins, are where Nincada emerged) is said to steal the spirits of onlookers. This myth is quite obviously untrue, as countless trainers have glimpsed into the holes during battle with no ill effects. Regardless, the myth is still popular among many young, impressionable trainers. Their shells are curiously hard, yet brittle, repelling a wide variety of attacks without even a scratch.

They use echolocation to navigate dark caves. Curiously, they can breathe using holes near their ears instead of their mouths, letting them to cry continuously without running out of air. Covering their ears, though, will cause them to stop wailing (Whismur can also breathe through their mouths when necessary, but cannot cry through them at the same time). In an increasingly loud cycle, the sound of their own crying will startle them and cause them to cry even more until they simply become too exhausted and fall asleep. By shrieking at such loud volumes, Whismur can cause rocks and stalactites to break off from the ceiling to the ground, trapping and injuring those beneath. Indeed, this is their main form of defense; their incessant wailing simultaneously disorients foes while causing the cave environments around them to come crashing down upon them.","Evolves into Loudred at Lvl 20Loudred evolves into Exploud at Lvl 40","Normal"," 2'00\" | 0.6 m"," 35.9 lbs | 16.3 kg"," Soundproof | ​Rattled"," Monster | Field","Habitat","Habitat","

They have very well-developed stomach muscles that allow them to quickly suck in large amounts of air before attacks. After they yell, the sheer volume of their shouting renders them deaf for a short period of time. They are highly vulnerable to retaliation during this period, as they cannot hear incoming attacks. During the mating season, Loudred can be seen engaging in shouting matches with each other in competition for mates. Dueling Loudred deafen each other quickly, but will continue yelling without actually knowing who is louder. Competitions end not when one Loudred is deemed the loudest, but rather when the others simply tire and walk away.

In battle, however, they reveals their true sonic capabilities. When attacking, their bellows can be heard from over 6 miles (10 kilometers) away, causing earthquakes that can be felt just as far.

Makuhita learn from their errors; each time they fall, they store energy for evolution and get right back up. They prize their might and work hard to maintain it. They make sure to keep balanced diets with enough calories to for their training and always gets enough sleep to be well-rested. They toughen their bodies by slamming into rocks and trees. Snapped trunks can be found near their training grounds. Distant rumbling in caves is often the sound of Makuhita toughening themselves on stone. Thanks to their practice, their bodies can withstand many powerful attacks. As they grow stronger, they will begin eating more to store energy before evolution. They begin practice in groups in the morning, eat lunch and nap in the afternoon, and then resume training in the evening. Though native to Hoenn, Makuhita have been imported to Alola, where they are celebrated for their purportedly superior strength. Makuhita trainers in the region have developed secret recipes for stews purported to maximize the strength and endurance of their Makuhita. Humorously enough, it is not uncommon in Alola to see Makuhita training their palms on trees and then get flung away after accidentally striking an Alolan Exeggutor. ","Evolves into Hariyama at Lvl 24","Fighting"," 3'03\" | 1.0 m"," 190.5 lbs | 86.4 kg"," Thick Fat | Guts |"," Sheer Force","Habitat","Habitat","

In particular, Hariyama take advantage of the latter’s tendency to paralyze foes. They will combo Force Palm with Smelling Salts, a move that is especially effective on paralyzed enemies. By clapping their two hands together around the heads of foes, Hariyama can easily disorient their opponents and leave them wide open to future attacks. Though most famous for their size and bulk, smaller Hariyama can be just as effective fighters by relying more heavily on speed and agility.

Their tails are packed with the nutrients they need to grow and also store the fat they obtain from food. A side effect of this is that their tails are very buoyant. This is helpful for Azurill, who are not very good swimmers, but enjoys playing in shallow water. On sunny days, groups of them can be seen splashing about at the water’s edge. When threatened, they can swing their tails at opponents, buying time to escape. They are prone to crying and will wail when frightened or hungry. When one Azurill in a group cries, the rest will follow suit, even if they don’t know why the initial Azurill was even crying in the first place.

Two Nosepass cannot approach each other headfirst, because their noses will repel each other away. Thanks to their lack of movement, Nosepass rarely need to eat, but will feed primarily on stone and metal, drawing out iron from rocks. They will also pull Steel-type Pokémon directly towards themselves, where they can then feed at their own leisure--though they may occasionally run into trouble when they accidentally pull in predators. During emergencies, Nosepass can actually spin part of their bodies rapidly to drill below to safety, though they can only move straight down in this manner. By controlling the strength of the magnetic force their noses exert, they can draw iron objects towards their bodies to use as armor against attacks or to trap unwary foes in magnetized iron.

However, it is difficult to earn a Skitty’s trust, as they are wary of strangers. They will quickly warm up to anyone who consistently supplies them with food and toys, though. In battle, they will attempt to intimidate foes by puffing up their tails and letting out squeaky growls. This often ends up making them appear adorable rather than intimidating, however.

Sableye dig holes in cave walls and floors in search of gems and ore, which they crush with their razor-sharp teeth before eating.  Minerals in the ore they eat crystallize on the surface of their bodies, forming various arrangements of gems that can differ between individuals. Their eyes glitter sinisterly when exposed to bright light, such as the beams from flashlights. The unsettling nature of their eyes have led to tales of Sableye stealing the souls of any unfortunate travelers who happen to gaze into them.

When iron grows scarce, herds of Aron may leave their mountain homes in search of food. This often takes them into urban towns and cities, where they can wreak havoc on iron structures. Aron will congregate around train tracks, bridges, and cars to feast on the abundant metals in them. Thanks to their weight and density, stronger Aron can even topple dump trucks by using Iron Head, providing rich sources of sustenance for their brethren. Most iron mining operations will section off areas exclusively for Aron and their evolutions to feed, hoping to placate them and lessen the chances of them leaving their mountains to feed in urban areas.

Volbeat congregate in large numbers near single Illumise, attracted by their alluring scent. Using their taillights and led by the Illumise, Volbeat swarms will draw complex geometric figures in the night sky in hopes of impressing them. By flashing and adjusting the intensity of their lights, Volbeat can converse with one another even when far away. When threatened, they will attempt to disorient foes by using Signal Beam before flying off. In a pinch, though, they can also use Tail Glow and power up their attacks to hit deceptively hardl such a tactic takes a lot out of these Pokémon, however, and renders their taillights useless for a few hours. Volbeat take the condition of their ponds very seriously, as the reflections of their swarms’ lights on the water play a major role in their displays. If their ponds become filthy, swarms may attempt to migrate to new, cleaner ones--but only if the resident Illumise approve of the move.","Also see Illumise","Bug"," 2'04\" | 0.7 m"," 39.0 lbs | 17.7 kg"," Illuminate | Swarm |"," Prankster","Habitat","Habitat","

They will guide them into constructing complex geometric patterns in the sky with their taillights. The more intricate the design an Illumise can lead its Volbeat in creating, the more highly it is regarded among its peers. Some scientists dedicate their entire careers to studying these mesmerizing patterns, of which over 200 separate varieties have been recorded. It has been determined that their scent-producing glands are located at the base of their antennae; should these glands become damaged, the Illumise will lose control over their Volbeat swarms, which will then disperse in confused disarray. During mating season, Illumise mate with just one lucky Volbeat in their swarms, selected based on the brightness and size of its taillight. The other members of the swarm aren’t fazed by their rejections, however, and will simply wait it out for the next mating season to arrive the following year.","Also see Volbeat","Bug"," 2'00\" | 0.6 m"," 39.0 lbs | 17.7 kg"," Illuminate | Tinted Lens |"," Prankster","Habitat","Habitat","

"315","Roselia","315","Gardens, fields","Roselia are serene Pokémon, spending most of their time lounging in the sun. Despite their miniature size, however, they are more than capable of defending themselves. The three horns on their heads can inject a vicious toxin into those foolish enough to try to pick their flowers (which they are very protective of). They can also fire thorns containing a similar toxin as projectiles. Each of their hands can shoot a different toxin; one causes a searing pain that can last for hours, while the other incapacitates foes with an effect similar to paralysis. Those who manage to enrage these normally docile Pokémon may find themselves subject to both of these at once. Their flowers emit a calming fragrance that placates nearby aggressors. The compounds that create this scent are used in many varieties of relaxing perfumes. Healthier Roselia produce stronger aromas. Roselia will drink spring water that is rich in minerals; the cleaner the water, the more vivid their flowers become. Some Roselia are said to develop specially-colored flowers from rare minerals in this water.","Evolves from Budew with high happiness during the day​Evolves into Roserade with a Shiny Stone","Grass","/Poison"," 1'00\" | 0.3 m"," 4.4 lbs | 2.0 kg"," Natural Cure | Poison Point |"," Fairy | Grass"," Fairy | Grass","

They also have disproportionately large mouths, capable of extending to swallowing things as tall themselves (their stretchy skin and lack of internal skeletons aid them in this task). Gulpin have no teeth or esophagi, so any food they swallow goes directly into their cavernous stomachs. Their gastric acids are some of the strongest natural acids known, capable of dissolving scrap iron within seconds. Because of this characteristic, Gulpin are not very picky eaters, consuming nearly anything that they can swallow. As they digest their meals, gases begin to build up within their bodies, which they release in periodic belches. The fumes they exhale are putrid and overpowering, capable of knocking people out simply from their overwhelming stench. The feather-like protrusions that stick out from their heads are purely for show. During the mating season, Gulpin with longer feathers are viewed as more attractive mates.","Evolves into Swalot at Lvl 26","Poison"," 1'04\" | 0.4 m"," 22.7 lbs | 10.3 kg"," Liquid Ooze | Sticky Hold |"," Gluttony","Habitat","Habitat","

Simply touching them can cause dizziness and nausea, while extended contact can lead to paralysis, convulsions, and even death. Swalot may employ one of a few different methods when hunting. Firstly, they may rub themselves against targets to immobilize them and then swallow them alive and whole. They can also spray foes with their toxins directly ​from their pores. Additionally, they may vomit some of their own stomach acids (which can dissolve nearly anything other than their own stomach linings) onto prey, dissolving them into more a digestible goop. Finally, they can simply use Belch to incapacitate targets with toxic fumes. When Swalot “yawn,” they are in fact preparing to attack. They have poor vision and use their “whiskers” to feel around.

Known for their savagery, they have strong, sturdy jaws that can tear apart solid steel boat hulls in one bite. Indeed, schools of Carvanha are famous for sinking many river-going ships attempting to make it to the sea. Carvanha schools mark their territory distinctly, leaving bite marks on the stones surrounding their swathes of rivers. They will only attack ships, people, and Pokémon that enter their territories, but will do so viciously and relentlessly. Carvanha are driven into feeding frenzies upon smelling blood, recklessly attacking anything around them that moves-including other Carvanha. It should be noted that in the unfortunate event of being caught in a Carvanha feeding frenzy, pinching their mouths shut will prevent them from biting; though they can shut their mouths with great power, they cannot open them with nearly as strong of a force. Additionally, Carvanha are only aggressive when in large schools, particularly in groups of five or more. Lone Carvanha are very timid and meek, swimming away from danger rather than attacking. In the wild, Carvanha are known to compete viciously with Basculin for territory.","Evolves into Sharpedo at Lvl 30","Water","/","Dark"," 2'07\" | 0.8 m"," 45.9 lbs | 20.8 kg"," "," ","

Nicknamed the “bullies of the sea” (also “gangsters,” “bandits,” or “ruffians”), Sharpedo are notorious for attacking boats, submarines, and even divers who dare venture into their territories. Their jaws are strong enough to rip apart sheet metal and oil tankers. When their teeth fall off, new ones will sprout up almost immediately in their place. Their skin is unique in texture; rubbing in the direction of rear to mouth, it feels as rough as sandpaper and can cut skin simply by brushing past. In the opposite direction, though, it is as smooth as steel. This quality along with their hydrodynamic body shape allows them to reach speeds of up to 75 mph (120 km/h) by jetting water through their bodies. Though they can only do this for short periods of time, it is more than enough to ram holes into boats or slam into larger prey. Legend has it that there is a Sharpedo as large as a Wailord swimming somewhere in the waters near the Hoenn region, but this has yet to be proven. Superstitious sailors will fashion good luck charms out of Sharpedo horns under the belief that they may help keep them safe on the waves.","Evolves from Carvanha at Lvl 30​Can Mega Evolve into Mega Sharpedo","Water","/","Dark"," 5'11\" | 1.8 m"," 195.8 lbs | 88.8 kg"," "," ","

"320","Wailmer","320","Open ocean, beaches","Wailmer spend much of their time swimming in the open ocean in pods. On bright and sunny mornings, however, they may begin swimming towards the shoreline. They can survive for short periods of time outside of the water, taking full advantage of this by beaching themselves on the sand to play. By swallowing large amounts of seawater, Wailmer can use their buoyant bodies to bounce around on land. The more water they swallow, the higher they bounce. Due to their sizes, though, they may become hazards for other beach-goers when they bounce. They generally stay far enough away from crowded areas for this to not be an issue, though. Their nostrils are located above their eyes; for fun, they will startle fishermen by suddenly spouting water from them. Wailmer eat tons of plankton daily, filtering water through their sieve-like teeth (actually baleen). If they lose too much of their stored water, they will begin to dry out and become lethargic. Kind beach-goers will often take the time to dump buckets of water onto dry Wailmer to rejuvenate them. According to Alolan legend, pods of Wailmer like to beach themselves because they once were land-dwelling Pokémon--a fact that science in fact supports, though through evolution rather than the mystical transformation by the gods that Wailmer underwent in the myth.","Evolves into Wailord at Lvl 40","Water"," 6'07\" | 2.0 m"," 286.6 lbs | 130.0 kg"," Water Veil | Oblivious |"," "," Field | Water 2"," Field | Water 2","

This can also make them a nuisance for fishermen, who sometimes have to chase them off if they encroach too heavily on their catches. These social Pokémon protect their own; if one member of a pod is attacked by a predator like Sharpedo or Dhelmise, the others will come to its aid and surround the attacker. When hunting, Wailord pods will leap out of the water, landing back down with humongous splashes to disorient prey and make capturing them in single gulps easy. They will also use this tactic to confuse foes. Though they must surface to breathe air every once in a while, they can dive as far as 10,000 feet (3,048 meters) with a single breath. They are slow swimmers, which unfortunately makes them targets for many poachers who value them for their uniquely airy blubber. If attacked, Wailord will jet water at opponents using Water Spout to knock them away. In popular media, Wailord are known for their slow, graceful swimming. Tourists will pay money to embark on guided Wailord-watching expeditions. There is also a popular televised situational comedy starring a Wailord and a Skitty, with their startling size disparity and habitat preferences often getting them into unfortunate situations.","Evolves from Wailmer at Lvl 40","Water"," 47'07\" | 14.5 m"," 877.4 lbs | 398.0 kg"," Water Veil | Oblivious |"," "," Field | Water 2"," Field | Water 2","

However, they are also rather dim-witted, unable to sense pain in most parts of their bodies. Their humps are filled with molten magma reaching temperatures of 2,200°F (1,100°C). When it rains, their magma cools and thickens, making them slower and more lethargic. When Numel use Fire-type attacks, their humps shrink; if their backs completely flatten, then they have used up all of their magma and must replenish it (in the wild, they do so by drinking lava flowing out of volcanoes; trained can use magma substitutes for Slugma and Magcargo found in most Poké Marts). In volcanic areas during ancient times, humans often used Numel to carry heavy cargo up mountain trails. Such a trend still carries on in some rural settlements today, where Numel farms rent trained Numel to hiking tourists.

Each of their humps essentially functions as a miniature volcano. Every 10 years or so, these humps will erupt on their own, without Camerupt forcing them to. Why this occurs is still unknown, but researchers believe that it may have to do with the building pressure of gases trapped within their bodies. Camerupt are mostly aloof, ignoring anything that doesn’t go out of its way to provoke them. However, they will become uncontrollably angry if something strikes their faces, erupting magma out of their humps recklessly and charging blindly at anything that moves.

Torkoal communicate with using this sound, altering its pitch, duration, and volume to convey different messages. The four hexagonal indents in their shells are also speculated to be used in communication; when Torkoal burn coal, these indents glow with varying intensities depending on how much coal they are burning. The speed at which Torkoal expel smoke is indicative of their health, with healthy Torkoal spewing it out quickly and forcefully. ​When threatened, Torkoal will use the move Smokescreen by exhaling black soot out of their orifices. Then, while attackers are blinded by smoke, they will attempt to flee as quickly as they can (albeit, this isn’t very swiftly). Larger Torkoal require more coal to stay active, but can also withstand longer periods of time without any of it; they will eventually become unable to move and die without fuel, however.

Spoink use their tails as springs to bounce around. The shocks from their rhythmic bouncing force their hearts to pump blood through their bodies. Because of this, they can never stop bouncing without risking death. Spoink even will bounce in place when sleeping. Their favorite food is underground truffles. However, they are physically ill-suited for digging them out. Luckily for them, Spoink possess mild powers of manipulation, persuading other Pokémon to dig them for them in return for a share of the meal.

Curiously, styles of dancing imitating their manipulation dances have emerged in multiple regions worldwide. In the past, many believed that their suggestive powers originated in their dancing and that performing the dances would gift the dancers with similar powers. In modern times, their powers are believed to have more to do with the pearls that focus their abilities. Grumpig pearls are regarded as precious gems and are sold for very high prices on the black market (whether they maintain their powers is uncertain).

Rather than actively going out and hunting for food, Trapinch simply wait for unwary prey to stumble into their holes; the steep sides cause additional sand to fall onto anything that tries to escape, only dragging unfortunate victims further in, where Trapinch await with open jaws. Then, Trapinch will simply reconstruct their pits and wait for new victims to fall in. When faced with particularly evasive prey, they may use their lower jaws as shovels to fling sand at their targets and cause them to lose their footing. To sleep, Trapinch simply burrow underneath the sand of their nests. Their jaws are strong enough to crush boulders as they tunnel. They can survive for a whole week without water; in fact, they often have to, since they spend most of their time waiting in their pits. If trainers accidentally fall into a Trapinch pits, it should be noted that Trapinch have very heavy jaws; if their victims manage to tip their heads over, they will have great difficulty righting themselves up again on their own.

"337","Lunatone","337","Caves, meteor crash sites","Lunatone are found near the sites of meteor crashes. Many believe that they have extraterrestrial origins because of this, but studies on them have returned inconclusive. The first Lunatone was discovered in 1963, when a cluster of extraterrestrial objects fell in present-day Meteor Falls, Hoenn. They float using telekinetic powers, becoming active at night when the moon is bright. Their power appears to be connected with the lunar cycle, becoming strongest when the moon is full. It is during this time that Lunatone are most active and commonly seen. As the moon ebbs, so does their strength. When the new moon arrives, Lunatone lose all of their power and hide away until the moon waxes again. Their ominous, glowing red eyes can paralyze onlookers with fear. Staring into them for too long can put observers to sleep. During the day or a new moon, however, their eyes appear faded and dull. In battle, they can harness the moon’s power to use Moonblast. Lunatone may also bolster their defenses by using Cosmic Power.","Also see Solrock","Rock/","Psychic",""," 3'03\" | 1.0 m"," 370.4 lbs | 168.0 kg"," Mineral"," Mineral","

Solrock appear to be closely related to the sun; they are active during the day from sunrise to sunset, for example. The more sunlight they are exposed to, the stronger they become. When the sun is obscured by clouds, Solrock weaken greatly. On sunny days, groups of them will line up and face the sun to soak in rays of sunlight. In battle, Solrock will spin their bodies rapidly. As they do so, they release bright flashes of light like miniature suns. The faster they spin, the brighter the light they release. Eventually, Solrock will “run out” of light to emit, at which point they will have to recharge by basking in sunlight again. Solrock radiate intense heat as they spin, even when not releasing light. They can also harness the sun’s power in battle by using Solar Beam, or even use Cosmic Power as a more defensive option.","Also see Lunatone","Rock/","Psychic"," 3'11\" | 1.2 m"," 339.5 lbs | 154.0 kg"," Levitate"," Mineral"," Mineral","

Their bodies are covered in a slippery mucus. that prevents bacteria from infecting their vulnerable skin. Additionally, it makes it difficult for foes to grasp them, especially important because Barboach often live in shallow water where they can easily be spotted by aerial predators. If this film dries, they will become weak and lethargic. Some regions hold Barboach-catching contests where entrants must catch the slippery creatures with their hands. Barboach are usually submerged in mud, leaving only their whiskers poking out. Their whiskers are extremely sensitive, acting like radars to help them navigate murky waters. The barbs can also sense passing prey, and can detect smell and taste at the same resolution as the human tongue. Barboach are not very picky eaters and will consume nearly anything they find. They can be seen scavenging the remains of the meals of other Pokémon or eating rotting plant material if food is scarce. In some regions, because of their love for the substance, Barboach are said to have been created from dried mud.","Evolves into Whiscash at Lvl 30","","","Water/Ground",""," 1'04\" | 0.4 m"," Oblivious | Anticipation |"," Oblivious | Anticipation |","

At night, they emerge to eat whatever they can find, waiting patiently at the bottoms of their ponds; as long as it is alive, Whiscash will eat it (they will sometimes even consume inanimate objects), along with a healthy gulp of muck from beneath as well. They make their nests by carving out shallow bowls in mud. Whiscash have poor eyesight and instead use their highly sensitive whiskers to navigate their murky surroundings. They are so sensitive, in fact, that they can sense minute vibrations of the earth and alert Whiscash of earthquakes before they even occur. Due to their territoriality, they become very hostile when foes enter their land. When threatened, they will go berserk and thrash about wildly to generate earthquakes with radii of over 3 miles (5 kilometers). They will also generate smaller tremors to scare out potential prey from the silt. It is said seeing a leaping Whiscash is an omen of an impending quake. In popular myth, a huge, oceanic Whiscash is said to be responsible for the world’s tremors. To date, no Whiscash has ever been found in saltwater.","Evolves from Barboach at Lvl 30","Water/Ground"," 3'11\" | 0.9 m"," 52.0 lbs | 23.6 kg"," Oblivious | Anticipation |"," Hydration","Habitat","Habitat","

"341","Corphish","341","Lakes, ponds, rivers, streams","Corphish are widely known as an invasive species, proliferating in nearly any body of water they enter. Originally native to Hoenn, they experienced a surge in popularity as pets when the king of Kalos requested Corphish to populate his garden ponds in the 1700s. Escaped Corphish likely are the root of many invasive populations today. Able to tolerate even the dirtiest waters, they quickly spread; they can now be found in regions like Sinnoh, Unova, Kalos, and Alola in addition to their native region. Their introduction in Alola in particular has been traced back to a pair released by a Hoenn immigrant who could no longer care for them. When Corphish begin populating a pond, they will begin bullying out native residents using their sharp claws; only the hardiest species like Magikarp and Feebas can tolerate the continual harassment. When they pinch foes, they hold onto them for as long as possible. Corphish can eat virtually anything; this, in combination with their pollution tolerance, aggressiveness, quick reproductive rate, and general willpower to survive, has made them great dangers to biodiversity in many freshwater habitats. Many regions have put forward efforts to control Corphish populations, but their hardiness has made this a difficult task.","Evolves into Crawdaunt at Lvl 30","Water"," 2'00\" | 0.6 m"," 25.4 lbs | 11.5 kg"," Hyper Cutter | Shell Armor |"," Adaptability","Habitat","Habitat","

They enjoy challenging other Pokémon in combat, even foes that are much weaker than themselves; in fact, they seems to enjoy bullying smaller Pokémon even more than defeating larger ones. When Crawdaunt come across other Pokémon in their territories, they will toss them out of the water violently with their claws. They bear scars on their carapaces with pride, indicating how many fights they have been in. They will ram their whole bodies into foes who approach their nests. Crawdaunt are also difficult to raise, preferring to attack for fun instead of battle. They are only vulnerable after molting or losing a claw; they will bury themselves in the mud to hide during this time, becoming uncharacteristically wary of combat.

"343","Baltoy","343","Ruins","Baltoy were first discovered in an ancient desert ruin, buried in the tomb of a young king. Because of this, it is believed that Baltoy once coexisted with this ancient civilization of humans, possibly revered or worshipped by them. This is further supported by wall paintings found in nearby ruins depicting what appear to be spinning Baltoy. When Baltoy find other Baltoy, they will congregate together and begin crying in unison, drawing more Baltoy to the area. Why they do so is unknown, but some speculate it may have to do with some sort of ancient human ritual ingrained in their memories. They seem to have a particular affinity for congregating around buried tombs and graveyards. Baltoy have spectacular senses of balance, capable of spinning on their feet even while sleeping. At times, Baltoy may be found spinning on their heads instead of their feet. Why they do so is unknown, as spinning in this manner does not improve their locomotion. A few modern scientists have hypothesized that Baltoy in fact have extraterrestrial origins. Though the theory lacks much evidence, it has still managed to gain some traction in popular culture.","Evolves into Claydol at Lvl 36","Ground/Psychic"," 1'08\" | 0.5 m"," 47.2 lbs | 21.5 kg"," Levitate"," Mineral","Overview","Overview","

They can fire destructive beams out of the tips of their arms, capable of reducing stone structures to rubble. Claydol began mysteriously appearing nearby ancient desert ruins around the same time the first Baltoy was found. The ruins they hover around date back over 20,000 years, leading many to speculate that Claydol are at least as old. The most common story regarding their origins is that Claydol were originally mud and clay statues created by an ancient desert civilization in imitation of a visitor from the heavens, animated by some mysterious beam of light from space. As ridiculous as the theory sounds, scientists have been unable to come up with a better explanation for the baffling conundrum of their existence.

Lileep are sessile; in ancient times, they rooted themselves onto rocks on the sea floor and waved their tentacles around to capture prey. The two yellow rings on their bells are in fact false eyes; their real eyes are on the tops of their heads, where they intently scan the vicinity for prey. Lileep often hide within large swathes of seaweed, capturing unsuspecting prey swimming through and swallowing them whole. Their tentacles resemble undersea flowers of sorts, attracting victims with their bright coloration and mesmerizing undulations. Once a Lileep roots itself on a rock, it will remain there for the rest of its life, regardless of how strong the waves or currents get. They are believed to have gone extinct roughly 100,000,000 years ago due to the rapidly-cooling climate. As an ice age approached, water temperatures dropped and prey began migrating southwards to warmer seas. Lileep, being unable to move, went extinct as their primary food sources depleted.","Evolves into Cradily at Lvl 40","Rock","/","Grass",""," 3'03\" | 1.0 m"," Suction Cups | ​Storm Drain"," Suction Cups | ​Storm Drain","

Like Lileep, they have fake eye spots on their bells to deter predators, with their real eyes located on their “true” bodies (their insides are very soft, held in place by the firmer green flesh surrounding it). Cradily can uproot themselves and slowly crawl around. They often nest in shallow waters, rooting to rocks and using their bodies to weigh themselves down and prevent themselves from being washed away by rough waves and tides. When the tide goes down, they roam around beaches to dig up prey from the sand. They can also crawl on the sea floor, using their tentacles to ensnare passing prey. Because Cradily lack teeth, their instead secrete acid from their tentacles to dissolve prey externally before feeding. This acid also paralyzes entangled victims so they cannot escape in the meantime. When the weather grew cold during an ice age and their prey migrated south, Cradily were too slow to keep up and likely went extinct because of this.","Evolves from Lileep at Lvl 40","Rock","/","Grass",""," 4'11\" | 1.5 m"," Suction Cups | ​Storm Drain"," Suction Cups | ​Storm Drain","

It is believed to have existed concurrently with Lileep and Cradily roughly 100,000,000 years ago, even sharing the same habitat of warm ocean reefs. In a process that continues to baffle modern scientists, their “wings” appear to be feet modified for swimming; most other ancient Pokémon adapted aquatic appendages for land, rather than vice versa. Regardless of how they came to be, Anorith travel using these wings to keep aloft, undulating their bodies in an “S” shape to swim surprisingly quickly. To hunt, they hide themselves between rocks on the sea floor, darting out to capture passing prey between their claws. Their mouths are located on their undersides. Scientists still debate why Anorith went extinct, considering that it is was more than capable of following migrating prey. The most likely explanation is that over time, Anorith simply became outclassed by more specialized hunters, dying out from their inability to compete with other predators. In modern times, resurrected Anorith do not fare well if released into the sea because the composition of seawater has changed over the past several millenia.","Evolves into Armaldo at Lvl 40","Rock","Bug"," 2'04\" | 0.7 m"," 27.6 lbs | 12.5 kg"," Battle Armor | ​Swift Swim"," Water 3"," Water 3","

The smaller, feather-like wings were used for fine-tuning their direction while in the water. Armaldo stab prey with their claws, which are strong enough to punch through solid steel or stone. These claws are retractable, allowing them to streamline their shape while swimming. Their bodies are clad in tough, armor-like plates of chitin that protect them from most attacks. It is not entirely clear why Armaldo went extinct, given their ability to hunt and move around amphibiously. It is likely that their slow speed was the main culprit; though they were versatile in their habitat ranges, their prey likely evolved to become faster with time; other, quicker predators were able to keep up, but the slow Armaldo were not able to match them. Recent studies suggest that Armaldo may in fact be a direct ancestor of some modern terrestrial Bug-types.","Evolves from Anorith at Lvl 40","Rock","Bug"," 4'11\" | 1.5 m"," 150.4 lbs | 68.2 kg"," Battle Armor | ​Swift Swim"," Water 3"," Water 3","

"349","Feebas","349","Ponds, lakes, rivers, seas","Though they may look weak and feeble, Feebas are surprisingly hardy Pokémon. They can survive in weed-choked ponds, even ones with very little water left. However, this does not translate well into battle, where Feebas are unable to do much. This lack of ability in combat, combined with their disheveled and tattered appearances, makes Feebas unpopular choices for most trainers--though a few Feebas maniacs certainly exist. To compound this problem, though they can be very plentiful in many areas where other Pokémon cannot be found, they also have the tendency to cluster in large numbers in very specific locations; despite being weak and defenseless, congregating en masse reduces the chance of each individual of being preyed upon—strength in numbers, essentially. This behavior makes them difficult to locate. Once found, though, their dimness makes them easy catches (though they are rather fast). Because they look quite ragged and unappetizing, though, many predators don't even bother trying to seek them out, allowing them to remain plentiful in their refuges. Feebas live near the mud at the bottoms of lakes; they are notable for being able to tolerate both fresh and salt water and are currently being studied for their hardiness.","Evolves into Milotic through trade with a Prism Scale","Water"," 2'00\" | 0.6 m"," 16.3 lbs | 0.6 kg"," Swift Swim | Oblivious |"," Adaptability","Habitat","Habitat","

Their beautiful scales can appear as any color of the rainbow; their hue changes based on the angle at which they are seen. Known as Prism Scales, it was recently discovered that these scales can induce evolution in Feebas under certain conditions.

In sunny weather, they become hot, dry Fire-types that resemble the sun; in rain, they become wet, soft, and slippery Water-types that exude liquid when touched and look like rain clouds; in hail or snow, they become cold Ice-types with partially-frozen bodies at 23ºF (-5ºC) and appear as snow clouds. In temperate weather, they revert to their Normal-type forms. Their moods also depend somewhat on the weather. Castform tend to be happy if it is bright outside, gloomy if it is cloudy, and irritable if it is stormy, for example. They can harness the power of the atmosphere with Weather Ball, utilizing their variable typing. Recently, the Weather Institute has discovered that their molecules are very similar to water molecules, a fact that was overlooked during their creation. Their transformations seem to be involuntary and instead depend on how the weather affects the configuration of their molecules. A well-documented experiment placing Castform in freezers, showers, and heaters did not induce a form in any case, suggesting that these Pokémon are influenced by a variety of environmental conditions beyond merely temperature and wetness.","Sunny Form","Normal (","Fire"," in Sunny Form, ","Water"," in Rainy Form, "," in Snowy Form)"," in Snowy Form)","

Still, despite this shortcoming, their ability to blend in nearly seamlessly into their surroundings is immensely useful to them for both hunting and avoiding predators. They can essentially turn invisible at a moment’s notice, making detection extremely difficult for predators who rely primarily on their senses of sight. When hunting, Kecleon blend into foliage and wait patiently for prey to wander by. Then, they lash out their long, sticky tongues to capture victims. Kecleon also change color based on their moods and health; what hue signifies what emotion can vary between individuals, though darker shade tend to correspond to healthier individuals. Their true colors can be revealed by startling them, as they briefly drop their disguises when they lose focus. Devon Scopes manufactured by Hoenn’s Devon Corp. can also be used to spot hidden Kecleon. Humorously, trained Kecleon often feel neglected when unspotted for too long, and may retaliate by refusing to reveal themselves to their trainers altogether--which only exacerbates the issue.","​Pokémon and all associated names and characters are trademarked and © 1995-2019 Nintendo. All non-original images are provided by Bulbapedia, © 1995-2019 Nintendo.No copyright infringement intended.","Normal"," 3'03\" | 1.0 m"," 48.5 lbs | 22.0 kg"," Color Change |"," "," Field"," Field","

They only venture out when there is snow, spending most of the spring and summer inside caves (Alolan Snorunt are more tolerant of heat). They can easily withstand temperatures as low as -150°F (-100°C); they regulate their body heat by shivering, helping them cope with such cold environments. In fact, their diets consist entirely of snow and ice, which they happily munch on while wandering through snow-covered areas. In the fall, Snorunt can occasionally be seen hiding together under piles of fallen leaves. They are quite a few pieces of folklore attached to Snorunt. One legend suggests that seeing a wild Snorunt at midnight indicates heavy snow the following day. Another says that if a Snorunt visits a home, all the members of that household will be prosperous for many generations to come. Indeed, in northern regions, almost all children from well-off families will have encountered a Snorunt at some point in their childhood. Snorunt are rarely found outside of snowy areas; if they wander too far from ice, they may panic and use Hail in attempts to make their surroundings snowy.","Evolves into Glalie at Lvl 40 or Froslass with a Dawn Stone if female","Ice"," 2'04\" | 0.7 m"," 37.0 lbs | 16.8 kg"," Inner Focus | Ice Body | Moody"," Fairy | Mineral","Overview","Overview","

"362","Glalie","362","Icy caves and peaks","Glalie have bodies of solid rock, though it isn't particularly hard for stone. To remedy this, they absorb moisture from the air and cover themselves in icy armor that is tempered so that it won’t melt, even when exposed directly to fire. When threatened, they can bolster their armor by freezing more water from the atmosphere. This ability also has a myriad of other uses. When hunting, for example, Glalie will sneak up on prey and freeze the air around them, entrapping them in blocks of ice. Once their victims are frozen, Glalie then enjoy eating them leisurely. In a less macabre application, they can manipulate and freeze moisture in the air into nearly any shape they desire; this makes them immensely useful in ice sculpting, though chisels are often needed for details. Their bodies are constantly shrouded in shimmering mists of diamond-like ice crystals. As Glalie travel, they leave trails of these crystals behind in the air, which sparkle beautifully in the sunlight. Glalie also leave lines of frost behind them as they float around, coating the ground, trees, or whatever else is nearby in a thin layer of ice. According to folklore, Glalie are born when the souls of deceased hikers possess boulders.","Evolves from Snorunt at Lvl 40​Snorunt can also evolve into Froslass with a Dawn Stone if femaleCan Mega Evolve into Mega Glalie","Ice"," 4'11\" | 1.5 m"," 565.5 lbs | 256.5 kg"," Inner Focus | Ice Body | Moody"," Fairy | Mineral","Overview","Overview","

"363","Spheal","363","Polar seas, icy caves","Spheal are often found on ice floes, playing together in small groups. They move faster via rolling than waddling, thanks to their rotund shapes. Their spherical bodies, however, are ill-fitted for swimming; Spheal only enter water to cross to new ice floes, and fumble around clumsily as they attempt to reach solid ground. In warmer weather, when ice floes are scarce, Spheal will shelter themselves in icy caves until winter arrives and icebergs become more plentiful. Their thick, plush fur and insulating blubber keep them warm even as they roll around on ice or swim in polar waters. Spheal clap their flippers together to express happiness. When mealtime arrives, large groups of Spheal can become very noisy as they all clap at once cacophonously. When threatened, Spheal can defend themselves deceptively well by using Ice Ball; they coat their bodies in layers of ice and roll into opponents. As they rolls their icy coverings pick up more snow from the ground and grow in size, hitting harder and harder as they continue to roll.","Evolves into Sealeo at Lvl 32​Sealeo evolves into Walrein at Lvl 44","Ice/","Water"," 2'07\" | 0.8 m"," 87.1 lbs | 39.5 kg"," Thick Fat | Ice Body | Oblivious","Habitat","Habitat","

When not hunting, they rest in groups atop of floating ice floes. They use their flippers to break apart chunks of ice that get in their way. Their noses are highly sensitive, both to scents and to textures. When these Pokémon comes across unfamiliar objects, their first instinct is to balance and spin them on their noses. As they do so, they carefully examine their smells and textures to decide whether or not they like them. Sealeo are especially fond of round objects; they often play with Poké Balls, for example. Rather humorously, Sealeo can often be found balancing their rounder, younger relatives Spheal on their noses; most Spheal seem unshaken by this behavior, however, and often even enjoy the horseplay. Sealeo can learn new tricks very easily, particularly those involving the use of their noses. Because of this, they are very popular Pokémon in circuses other performing venues.","Evolves from Spheal at Lvl 32Evolves into Walrein at Lvl 44","Ice/","Water"," 3'07\" | 1.1 m"," 193.1 lbs | 87.6 kg"," Thick Fat | Ice Body | Oblivious","Habitat","Habitat","

They will fight ferociously with other Walrein over land, with all parties often emerging brutally injured and scarred. Only one Walrein will preside over an entire colony of Spheal and Sealeo. They are willing to defend their colonies with their lives. Their thick blubber keeps them insulated against the icy cold. Additionally, the blubber is also able to deflect attacks aimed at them. Their most prized possessions are their grand tusks. Capable of shattering ice blocks weighing up to 10 tons, Walrein use them to break through ice floes. In battle, one of their tusks may occasionally break off. Though they will eventually grow back, the loss of a tusk can be devastating to their status with others of their species. During mating season, for example, the Walrein with the longest tusks are viewed as the most attractive. Walrein with short or deformed tusks are treated as outcasts and shunned among other Walrein, as they appear unfit to lead their own colonies.","Spheal evolves into Sealeo at Lvl 32Evolves from Sealeo at Lvl 44","Ice/","Water"," 4'07\" | 1.4 m"," 332.0 lbs | 150.6 kg"," Thick Fat | Ice Body | Oblivious","Habitat","Habitat","

"366","Clamperl","366","Sea floors","Clamperl have nearly-impenetrable shells, capable of deflecting most attacks directed at them. As a side effect of this, their shells are often covered in nicks and gashes by the time they are ready for evolution. Their main bodies are the fleshy blue muscles within their shells; their “heads” are the pink pearls nestled within. The longer they live, the larger these pearls grow. Clamperl hunt small aquatic prey; they patiently wait for unwary prey to swim by before quickly clamping their shells shut around them. One can tell when they are approaching evolution because their bodies will begin to outgrow their shells, making it difficult for them to clamp their shells shut. Clamperl only create a single pearl during their lifetimes, the one that they use as “heads.” These pearls are lauded as being imbued by mysterious powers that focus psychic abilities when held. When Clamperl evolve, they release their pearls onto the ocean floor. These pearls often make their way to shore via currents, where wild Spoink gather and use them to focus their own psychic abilities. They are also incredibly valuable to collectors, who will pay ten times the price of Shellder pearls for them.","Evolves into Huntail through trade with a Deep Sea Tooth or Gorebyss through trade with a Deep Sea Scale","Water"," 1'04\" | 0.4 m"," 115.7 lbs | 52.5 kg"," Shell Armor | Rattled"," Water 1","Overview","Overview","

"367","Huntail","367","Ocean trenches and abysses","Huntail dwell in deep ocean waters, where little light ever penetrates. Despite this, their eyes are very keen, letting them see clearly even in the murky depths. Their sturdy spines allow them to survive the crushing pressure of the deep. Huntail utilize bioluminescence to capture prey. The spots on their bodies light up to attract food. They are not very strong swimmers, and instead use their fish-shaped tails to lure in prey. The “eyes” on their tails glow as they wave them back and forth, fooling victims into swimming closer. Then, they unhinge their jaws and swallow their victims whole. Huntail swim by wriggling their bodies like snakes. On occasion, one of their teeth may fall off as they feed. They eventually grow the fangs back, but the fallen teeth often end up on shore as Deep Sea Teeth. Huntail may occasionally be found near the surface of the water, but such sightings are extremely rare; the significant difference in pressure from their natural habitats is detrimental to their health, so surfacing Huntail are likely very ill and in need of immediate medical attention. It is said that a Huntail washing up on shore is an omen of bad things to come.","Evolves from Clamperl through trade with a Deep Sea Tooth​Clamperl can also evolve into Gorebyss through trade with a Deep Sea Scale","Water"," 5'07\" | 1.7 m"," 59.5 lbs | 27.0 kg"," Swift Swim | Water Veil"," Water 1","Overview","Overview","

However, they are capable of adjusting their internal pressure so that they can spend extended periods of time in sunny, shallow tropical reefs. Gorebyss sometimes feed on seaweed growing between rocks, but they are more well-known for their surprisingly cruel tendencies; they can pierce the flesh of prey with their siphon-like mouths and suck out their body fluids. The drained carcass then sinks to the ocean floor, where it provides valuable sustenance for benthic scavengers. Despite this unsettling feeding method, Gorebyss are lauded as beautiful and graceful swimmers. Watching them swim is intensely mesmerizing due to their impeccable form. In the springtime, their bodies turn a more vivid pink as the water temperature rises; their coloration gets brighter in warmer water, turning to an absolutely brilliant hue in tropical regions like Alola. As Gorebyss swim, they occasionally shed a few of their pink scales. These scales find their way to shore as Deep Sea Scales. Thanks to their sturdy bodies, Gorebyss are able to withstand powerful attacks that few would expect them to be able to.","Evolves from Clamperl through trade with a Deep Sea Scale​Clamperl can also evolve into Huntail through trade with a Deep Sea Tooth","Water"," 5'11\" | 1.8 m"," 49.8 lbs | 22.6 kg"," Swift Swim | Hydration"," Water 1","Overview","Overview","

"369","Relicanth","369","Deep ocean waters, underwater caves","Relicanth are an unbelievably ancient species, long believed to be extinct until one was accidentally discovered on a deep-sea voyage a few decades ago. Fossil records show that they have been around for at least 100,000,000 years (making them concurrent with the likes of Lileep and Anorith), and have miraculously remained essentially unchanged since then, as they have adapted to fit their ecological niche quite well. They lack teeth, instead filter-feeding on microscopic organisms. Their scales are as hard as rocks, with a texture similar to craggy boulders. Their bodies are dense and packed with fat, allowing them to survive the immense pressure of the deep. Relicanth have the odd tendency to “walk” on the sea floor by using their pectoral fins as “legs”. They are nocturnal Pokémon, spending most of the day in underwater caves where the water is cooler so that they expend less energy regulating their body heat. At night, they emerge to filter-feed. Though rather slow, Relicanth are more than capable of defending itself when threatened with the powerful Head Smash. Their scientific name, Latimeria anciens, comes from the name of the scientist who rediscovered it.","​Pokémon and all associated names and characters are trademarked and © 1995-2019 Nintendo. All non-original images are provided by Bulbapedia, © 1995-2019 Nintendo.No copyright infringement intended.","Water","/","Rock"," 3'03\" | 1.0 m"," 51.6 lbs | 23.4 kg"," Water 1 | Water 2"," Water 1 | Water 2","

During breeding season, the water appears a vivid pink as thousands of Luvdisc school together beneath the waves. They are famous for their heart-shaped bodies, spawning a variety of legends around them pertaining to love and affection. It is said, for example, that beachside couples who are fortunate enough to spot Luvdisc in the water will be blessed with eternal love. Some people gift their significant others Luvdisc to celebrate honeymoons and anniversaries. Luvdisc have a curious habit of congregating near couples out at sea, tailing them all the way back to shore. Heart Scales, coveted by collectors for their iridescent beauty, are shed by Luvdisc. A few centuries ago, these Pokémon underwent a brief but unfortunate period of overfishing when their scales were purported to guarantee one success in romantic endeavors. During mating season, pairs of Luvdisc can often be seen “kissing” as part of a complex mating ritual that bond them together for life. In a macabre mechanism of sexual selection, lone Luvdisc despairingly float near the surface, where they become easy prey for Pelipper.","​Pokémon and all associated names and characters are trademarked and © 1995-2019 Nintendo. All non-original images are provided by Bulbapedia, © 1995-2019 Nintendo.No copyright infringement intended.","Water"," 2'00\" | 0.6 m"," 19.2 lbs | 8.7 kg"," Swift Swim | Hydration"," Water 2","Overview","Overview","

"371","Bagon","371","Caverns, cliffs, canyons","Bagon can be found in caverns or near cliffs, canyons, and other areas with stark differences in elevation. This is because their favorite pastime is jumping headfirst off of ledges. They are motivated by a deeply instinctive desire to fly, more than they want to sleep or even eat. Because of this, Bagon spend most of their days futilely jumping off of cliffs in attempts to become airborne, only eating and sleeping when their bodies can no longer handle the exhaustion. Their heads have developed “helmets” as hard as tempered steel that protect them from being injured during their dives. Every few hundred jumps or so, they will take out their anger at not being able to fly on nearby boulders, which they will smash into pebbles with their hard heads. They are very powerful despite their size. In particular, their neck muscles are very well-developed, helping them smash their heads into foes. Recent studies show that this repeated bashing may actually be necessary to promote the growth of certain cells in their bodies that facilitate evolution. As this event approaches, Bagon will begin to eat much more than normal, storing energy in preparation for the big event.","Evolves into Shelgon at Lvl 30Shelgon evolves into Salamence at Lvl 50","","Dragon",""," 2'00\" | 0.6 m"," 92.8 lbs | 42.1 kg"," Dragon"," Dragon","

They rarely eat, relying on the energy they stored as Bagon prior to evolution. They toughen their own willpower and become hardier through this fasting as they prepare to evolve. Inside their shells, their cells are rapidly multiplying as they begin creating new bodies. Once Shelgon are ready for evolution, their shells simply peel right off as Salamence emerge from within. Shelgon are a very hardy species that can survive in most climates. They are resistant to both extreme cold and heat thanks to their insulating armor. However, they avoid deep water at all costs; their heavy shells render them unable to float and their stubby limbs make it impossible for them to swim.

Naturally, they take great advantage of this, spending most of their spare time simply soaring about in the air and not landing until they physically can no longer stay aloft. While flying, Salamence may express their joy by spouting flames out of their mouths. They are highly territorial, going on tremendous rampages when their territories are challenged. They can easily level swathes of forest using their viciously sharp claws and broiling flames. In ancient times, these Pokémon were known for razing entire villages; those who could defeat Salamence in their caves were lauded as heroes for defending their homes. They can fly very quickly, but only for short periods of time. Popular culture details that their great desire to fly caused their cells to mutate and their wings to sprout.

They generate magnetic forces that repel them from the earth’s natural poles, allowing them to float. All the cells in their bodies are magnetic, though they can control the strength of the magnetic forces they generate. They can communicate with each other over long distances by sending magnetic pulses. When close together, they can also use telepathy to converse. Because of this, Beldum in swarms will move together in perfect unison. They can sleep at any angle, even upside-down or sideways; they often anchor themselves to the faces of cliff when resting by using the claws on their rears. When threatened, Beldum will tackle foes head-on using Take Down; though this technique appears to be the only attack they can utilize in battle, their density and weight mean that their headbutts are usually more than enough to deter attackers. They will also use their magnetism to draw in and slash at metallic enemies, and will release a magnetic pulse if surrounded that can disrupt nearby electronics.","Evolves into Metang at Lvl 20Metang evolves into Metagross at Lvl 45","Steel","/","Psychic"," 2'00\" | 0.6 m"," 209.9 lbs | 95.2 kg"," Mineral"," Mineral","

They can fly around quickly, easily reaching speeds of over 60 mph (100 km/h); when they do so, they rotate their arms so that their claws face rearwards like thrusters, streamlining their silhouettes. These powerful claws can tear through thick iron sheets like silk. Their bodies are incredibly hard; crashing straight into jet planes wouldn’t scratch them. Their two separate brains do not make them more intelligent than Beldum, but do make them think twice as fast; Metang are very useful for solving complex equations or cracking passwords through brute force, as they can use both of their brains to test possible solutions in half the time. In battle, Metang have can wield a much wider variety of attacks their pre-evolutions, using moves like Metal Claw and Zen Headbutt to take down foes.

They use this ability to analyze situations in battle, factoring in aspects such as accuracy, probability, and even physics to mathematically determine the best possible course of action. Physically, they aren’t lacking, either, capable of pummeling foes down with the powerful Meteor Mash. Their iron-hard bodies can weather most attacks with ease. They use their heavy bodies and sharp claws to pin down prey, consuming them with the mouths on their undersides. By tucking in their four legs, Metagross can hover in the air via magnetic force. Though this is faster than walking, it is also more tiring. Like Metang, Metagross are immensely useful to scientists for calculating difficult equations--Metagross can even compute twice as quickly as Metang.

The Pokémon stopped the volcanic eruption and saved the forest. After this, Regigigas sealed itself away and turned itself into stone, sending its protectors away to a distant region; anyone who wished to awaken it would have to bring back its guardians as well. This legend, taken from the Snowpoint Temple in Sinnoh, then connects to the Regi myth of Hoenn; Regirock was one of three Pokémon sealed away for being too powerful, transformed into a column of stone. The rocks making up its body come from all over the world, giving it a patchy appearance. If Regirock is injured, it simply repairs itself with any nearby stone it can find, hence its varied composition.

Along with the other three Regis, Regigigas is said to have crafted Regice by hand, in this case using pure, tempered glacial ice. Regice’s body remains at a freezing temperature of -328°F (-200°C), cooling the air around it to a similar temperature. Regice can control this frigid air, using it to selectively freeze parts of its surroundings. Its body is so cold that it is said not to melt even when submerged in lava. The ice composing its body was curiously discovered to be identical to ice core samples taken from the South Pole, particularly the layers concurrent with the last major ice age. This has led to the theory that Regice, along with the other three Regis, was created some time during that period.

It is speculated that Registeel was created from the metals found in fallen meteorites, which Regigigas then tempered underground. Along with its brethren, Registeel is fabled to have stopped the eruption at modern Snowpoint City before being sent away to Hoenn, where it was locked away for being too powerful. It is said to have transformed into a pillar of iron as it waited. Registeel communicates by flashing the lights on its head in varying patterns.

Latias can communicate telepathically with others, but will only do so with individuals that have no intent to cause harm. Its body is covered in a glass-like down that curiously can bend in a way that refracts light and essentially makes Latias invisible. It can also use this ability to alter its appearance, often taking the form of a young human girl. Latias’s affinity for empathy allows it to use a strange ability known as “sight sharing;” it can allow others to see what it sees, and vice versa. It is capable of using the move Mist Ball in battle, a technique making use of its refractive down. It is said that Latias live in small herds, but no one knows how many exist (there may even be only one).

Many speculate that it feeds on dust, water vapor, or even meteorites, which are through to fuel a Mega Stone-like “mikado” organ in its body. Due to its habitat, Rayquaza is almost never seen by humans; even when it is, it is often mistaken for a comet soaring through the sky. This Pokémon was only recently discovered, when modern technology enabled humans to travel into space; strange behavior in air currents and cloud patterns led to its eventual discovery. In the Hoenn myth, it twice calmed Kyogre and Groudon during their titanic conflicts (once at the end of the Primal Age and again after a crashing meteor released natural energy that revitalized them), clearing the skies of both drought and storm before sending them off. It is said that should something ever happen to Rayquaza, both Kyogre and Groudon would rise and resume their battle, destroying all life on the earth.","Can Mega Evolve into Mega Rayquaza​Also see Groudon and Kyogre","Dragon","/Flying"," 23'00\" | 7.0 m"," 455.2 lbs | 206.5 kg"," Air Lock","Habitat","Habitat","

"385","Jirachi","385","Caves, ruins","Jirachi is said to slumber somewhere deep in the mountains, only awakening once every 1,000 years. Its awakening coincides with the appearance of the Millennium Comet in the skies above, waking when it can first be spotted and returning to sleep when the last portion of it disappears. This period appears to last for exactly one week. Once Jirachi wakes up, it is thought to grant any wishes written on each of its three tags; this likely means that it can at most grant 3 wishes each time it wakes. While Jirachi is asleep, it covers itself in a large, crystalline shell. It can fend off attackers without waking by using powerful moves like Doom Desire. Jirachi is also said to awaken if one sings to it with a “voice of purity.” Once awake, some believe that it can grant any number of “small” wishes (conjuring trinkets and food items, for instance) to those pure of heart (though large wishes can still only be granted via its tags). Before Jirachi returns to its slumber, the third eye on its chest will open up and begin to absorb energy from its surroundings. It then slowly uses this energy up it sleeps.","​Pokémon and all associated names and characters are trademarked and © 1995-2019 Nintendo. All non-original images are provided by Bulbapedia, © 1995-2019 Nintendo.No copyright infringement intended.","Steel/Psychic"," 1'00\" | 0.3 m"," 2.4 lbs | 1.1 kg"," Serene Grace"," Undiscovered","Overview","Overview","

As the meteorite was being examined in a laboratory, a laser hitting the virus mutated it into Deoxys. Deoxys sports a number of abilities based on its curious origins. It can regenerate parts of its body with ease, for example. It can also morph its helical hands into prehensile arms. Deoxys can create clones of itself to carry out tasks, though the clones are weaker and lack crystalline organs on their chests (believed to be their brains). This organ can also shoot lasers for some inexplicable reason. It has psychokinetic powers, letting it use moves like Psycho Boost. Deoxys has an odd connection to auroras; one appears each time it changes forms, for instance. It is said that it uses them to communicate with its clones or even to extraterrestrial beings. In Attack Forme, Deoxys’s offenses are greatly heightened at the cost of its defenses. In Defense Forme, its cells mutate to absorb most standard attacks.

As Very mild natured creatures, Turtwig are neither fussy nor egregious, making them popular choices among laid-back trainers. Turtwig rarely eat solid food (though they do indulge in Berries from time to time), gathering most of their energy via photosynthesis primarily through the leaves on their heads. The “shells” on their backs are actually layers of hardened soil. Turtwig must drink lots of clean water to keep their shells from becoming too dry and cracking. The shells of healthy Turtwig should feel moist to the touch, but not so waterlogged that they crumble when prodded. When Turtwig are thirsty, their leaves will wilt. Recently, researchers have discovered that their entire bodies can in fact undergo photosynthesis, allowing them to survive even if their leaves are damaged. Because of this, they are constantly enveloped in layers of clean oxygen. Thanks to their easygoing personalities, Turtwig have remained popular choices for trainers in Sinnoh for decades.","﻿Evolves into Grotle at Lvl 18Grotle evolves into Torterra at Lvl 32","Research Notes","Grass"," 1'04\" | 0.4 m"," 22.5 lbs | 10.2 kg"," Overgrow |","Shell Armor","Shell Armor","

They are heavily reliant on fresh water to keep their soil-based shells healthy; because of this, they will constantly search out new water sources in their forests. Each Grotle is said to have its own personal spring to reliably obtain water from. Grotle are benevolent Pokémon, often carrying tired, smaller Pokémon on their backs to their springs so they can rejuvenate themselves. Their bushes, which are rooted in their earthly shells, occasionally grow Berries or nuts. Avian Pokémon gladly perch on their backs to consume their fruit. Grotle don’t mind this, as they are easygoing Pokémon. During the daytime, Grotle will leave their shady forests for open fields and clearings. As they bathe in direct sunlight, the bushes on their backs photosynthesize energy for them to use. In cloudy weather, Grotle will forage for Berries in the forest as they wait for the skies to clear. It is said that Grotle have an innate ability to find clean water, making them popular choices for forest travelers.","﻿Evolves from Turtwig at Lvl 18Evolves into Torterra at Lvl 32","Research Notes","Grass"," 3'07\" | 1.1 m"," 213.8 lbs | 97.0 kg"," Overgrow |","Shell Armor","Shell Armor","

Torterra do not move around often, gathering most of their energy from photosynthesis via the trees and other plant life on their backs. Because of their sedentary nature, the environments on their backs often becomes the homes of smaller Pokémon who nest within the miniature ecosystems. Some Pokémon spend their entire lives on their backs, from birth to death. When groups of these Pokémon migrate, it looks like entire forests are moving. Some regions have myths detailing that the entire world in fact rests on the shell of a gigantic, immobile Torterra. Though typically docile, Torterra can retaliate powerfully when they or the inhabitants of their shells are threatened by using the devastating Wood Hammer. Thanks to their curious combination of peaceful demeanors and tremendous offensive and defensive capabilities in battle, Torterra have been and likely will remain reliable partners for Sinnoh trainers for years to come.","﻿Turtwig evolves into Grotle at Lvl 18Evolves from Grotle at Lvl 32","Research Notes","Grass","/Ground"," 7'03\" | 2.2 m"," 683.4 lbs | 310.0 kg"," "," ","

They are “balls of energy”, so to speak; they love to play around and have fun, even when in battle. They are very agile, capable of leaping across ravines and scaling up cliff faces in mountains. Chimchar are social Pokémon, almost always found with others of their kind leaping around on trees and boulders. The fires on their rears are fueled by gases within their bodies; as long as they can continue supplying gas, the flames won’t go out, even in rain. When Chimchar are sick, however, they have trouble producing enough gas to keep their fires burning; their flames will sputter and burn weakly as a result. Their fires will only go out when they are asleep, likely to prevent themselves from accidentally igniting brushfires while resting. Their playful natures also unfortunately carry into battle; they will often goof around and not take commands seriously. Despite this, their joyful attitudes and agility makes them popular choices as starters in the Sinnoh region.","﻿Evolves into Monferno at Lvl 14Monferno evolves into Infernape at Lvl 36","Research Notes","","Fire",""," 1'08\" | 0.5 m"," Blaze |"," Blaze |","

However, they have become much more perceptive of the situations they are in and have learned to handle themselves more seriously in battle. Monferno are adept fighters, using both their flames and fists to defeat opponents. They can take advantage of their environments to the fullest extent, jumping off of walls and ceilings to attack foes aerially from unexpected angles. By enlarging the flames on their tails, Monferno can make themselves appear bigger to intimidate attackers. They also use this technique for spacing, warding foes off by making their flames bigger or drawing them closer by feigning exhaustion and weakening their fires. In the wild, Monferno live in packs of roughly a dozen members each with rigid pecking orders. Individuals are ranked based on the sizes of their flames when fully lit and the brightness of the blue “masks” on their faces; Monferno with the largest flames and the brightest masks are ranked the highest.

They are capable of cloaking their limbs in flames to scorch foes with physical attacks. The crowns of fire on their heads burn more intensely as they become more heated in battle. These flames cannot be extinguished and are said to represent their undying, fiery spirits in combat. Outside of battle, Infernape retain the playful demeanors of their pre-evolutions. They will quickly assume more somber personas, however, when threatened, as their battling spirits overtake their bodies. They can assail opponents with powerful moves such as Flare Blitz and Close Combat in battle.

They will refuse to accept food or shelter given to them by others, including their trainers. Instead, they will adamantly find their own food and stubbornly sleep outside rather than indoors or within their Poké Balls. Piplup are far more adapted to aquatic than terrestrial life; they can dive for up to 10 minutes at a time without coming up for air. On land, they are rather clumsy, falling flat on their faces often. However, these tumbles don’t hurt their pride, and they will simply continue walking with their heads held high (literally). Piplup are covered in thick down that insulates them against their chilly northern environments. They almost always keep their chests puffed up as a display of pride. Piplup are difficult to train, as they are too proud to take orders from trainers, and it takes much effort to bond with such prideful Pokémon.

They nimbly chase down prey underwater before bringing their meals back to the surface. When not swimming, Prinplup can be found resting on icebergs and ice floes. In the water, they use their hard wings to break apart ice as they swim. It is believed that their coloration makes them harder to spot in the water, allowing them to ambush prey. From below, their light blue feathers blend in with sunlit waters, the white spots breaking up their outlines. From above, the darker blue shades match that of deep sea waters. When two Prinplup meet, they will engage in displays of dominance to assert control over disputed territory.

While each member retains its own individuality and sense of self-worth, they have learned that teamwork in hunting yields far superior results when compared to solitary attempts. The Empoleon with the largest horns on their heads are the leaders of the groups. Empoleon can swim as fast as a jet boat, using their steel-hard wings to slice through ice floes. They are too proud to involve themselves in petty disputes, instead appearing aloof in most conflicts; however, they will viciously attack anyone that hurts their pride with the powerful Hydro Pump or devastating slashes with their wings.

Though naturally found in forests and mountains, their hardy natures have also made them common sights above towns and cities as well. Starly fly in large flocks, with larger groups known to blot out the sun as they migrate through populated areas. Alone, Starly are rather unremarkable Pokémon; in flocks, however, groups of them can beat their wings in unison to whip up windstorms. Their small wings are strong in comparison to the rest of their bodies, enabling them to fly for long distances. There appears to be a limit on how large flocks of Starly can be, though researchers are not sure exactly what this number is. After a certain size, Starly will begin bickering and scatter in different directions, splitting off into separate flocks. The Pokémon have very strident cries; their cacophonous singing can cause large disturbances in urban areas. Though primarily insectivorous, Starly will also feed on fruits and nuts from time to time.","﻿Evolves into Staravia at Lvl 14Staravia evolves into Staraptor at Lvl 34","Research Notes","Normal","/Flying"," 1'00\" | 0.3 m"," 4.4 lbs | 2.0 kg"," "," ","

Staravia flocks stick together, with members being able to recognize each other on sight. They are territorial, staking out swathes of forest and defending their land from others. Should two flocks encounter each other, they will begin to bicker and engage in fierce aerial fights over disputed territory. The battles only end once all members of one of the flocks have been knocked out of the sky. Staravia feed mostly on insects. While Starly tend to go after slow, grounded prey like Wurmple, though, Staravia can seize aerial insects in mid-flight. They occasionally indulge themselves in fruits and nuts found within their forest habitats. Lone Staravia can easily be recognized by their shrill, harsh cries.

Though their swimming isn’t stellar, it still is respectable for non-Water-types. Perhaps their most important trait, however, is their industriousness. Bidoof are exceptionally hard workers, laboring from dawn to dusk as they build and repair nests on the riverside. Even when finished with this task, they will gnaw down logs for their evolutions Bibarel to use in their dams, still intent on helping out. It is no surprise, given this, that diligent workers are “as busy as Bidoof.” While Bidoof work, they focus all of their attention on their tasks, ignoring everything else around them. This has given them reputations for being unaware of things happening to them. Bidoof routinely whittle their teeth by gnawing on logs and rocks.

Bibarel make their nests by damming up rivers with logs and mud. They spend their days cutting down new trees to patch up holes in their dams while making sure that they will not overflow. This rigorous inspection process is highly effective; within the last decade, there have been fewer overflows in Bibarel dams than their have in human ones. Because of this, communities who live near or in former riverbeds greatly appreciate Bibarel populations, holding festivals in honor of these diligent Pokémon. Bibarel are sensitive to small changes in water currents, allowing them to sense flash floods before they occur.

Though their antennae are mostly stiff, Kricketot can adjust them slightly near the tips. By subtly curling and uncurling their antennae, Kricketot can alter the lengths of their exposed sections, thereby changing the pitches they make when they clang together. Altering the pitch and the rhythm of their clattering enables Kricketot to send complex messages to their peers. During the mating season, male Kricketot will compete with each other to compose beautiful melodies in order to seduce mates. As their mating season coincides with the beginning of autumn, many people associate Kricketot songs with the arrival of fall.

Some villages hold Kricketune concerts in the autumn, where their wildly variable melodies are rated against one another. In battle, their musical capabilities manifest as the attack Bug Buzz. They use their sharp arms to slash foes that come too close, though they are also known to direct “symphonies” of Kricketot and Kricketune using their arms as well.

They rely primarily on Luxio to bring back food, though they will attempt to chase down smaller prey from time to time to hone their skills. Shinx are often seen playing around, chasing each other around in fields and transferring electricity to each other through small shocks. This play helps train their hunting and electrical skills. If Shinx wander too far from home, they will use electricity to make their fur glow in order to alert their families of their whereabouts. Though they can harness electricity to fire off attacks like Spark, they are rather inexperienced at doing so, often injuring themselves in the process.

"406","Budew","406","Gardens, fields","Budew are found alongside clean water sources; they obtain most of their energy from the sun and water around them. Their buds remain closed throughout the winter as they endure the cold weather. Once the temperature rises in the spring, they will open their buds to scatter pollen. This pollen is in fact mildly toxic; it can trigger allergic reactions in many people and Pokémon, inducing harsh sneezing and runny noses. Budew rely primarily on their toxic pollen to discourage predators; they can also use Worry Seed to induce anxiety in foes via hallucinogenic plant seeds. Access to cleaner water seems to be correlated with more toxic pollen. Though they have historically been used as indicators of spring, recent studies have shown that Budew have begun opening their buds earlier and earlier in the season for the past few decades. Scientists believe that this trend is due to rising global temperatures, as Budew appear to open their buds in response to the climate rather than the time of year. Budew are keeping their buds open for longer periods of time because of the warmer weather, a nuisance for many people and Pokémon due to their pollen’s allergy-inducing effects.","Evolves into Roselia with high happiness during the dayRoselia evolves into Roserade with a Shiny Stone","Grass","/Poison"," 0'08\" | 0.2 m"," 2.6 lbs | 1.2 kg"," Natural Cure | Poison Point |"," Undiscovered"," Undiscovered","

Cranidos also tackle prey headfirst to take them down. They are omnivorous—when not hunting, they can often be found eating ferns and other low-growing plants. They also forage the Berries knocked out of the trees and shrubs they destroy while charging. Cranidos live in herds of 15 to 20 members, consisting both of Cranidos and their evolutions Rampardos. While not the smartest Pokémon these herds find strength in numbers, using their heads to fend off attackers like Aerodactyl from all directions. While able to attain high speeds, Cranidos require lots of room in order to accelerate properly. In cramped areas, they become vulnerable due to their inability to headbutt at full speed.

Their skulls are nearly a foot (0.3 m) thick, enabling them to withstand nearly any cranial blow. Consequently, however, this leaves little room for brain growth; as a result, these Pokémon are not very intelligent (their brains are even smaller that those of Cranidos). They will charge at anything they perceive to be threats. This occasionally even includes inanimate objects like boulders and trees; one modern incident involves a just-revived Rampardos pulverizing a skyscraper. Rampardos charge recklessly through forests when pursuing pursuing prey, leaving trails of fallen trees behind. Rampardos will ram heads together to compete for dominance until one gives; their thick skulls ensures that this process is a very arduous and time-consuming ritual. Archaeological evidence shows that some ancient cultures in fact unearthed Rampardos skulls and used them as helmets in combat. Though popular culture often portrays Rampardos as having gone extinct due to their low intellect, most scientists agree that they died out during an ice age that killed off much of the currently existing life at the time; a cooling climate destroyed most of the tropical plants that they relied upon for survival.","Evolves from Cranidos at Lvl 30","Rock"," 5'03\" | 1.6 m"," 226.0 lbs | 102.5 kg"," Mold Breaker | ​Sheer Force"," Monster","Habitat","Habitat","

"410","Shieldon","410","Prehistoric forests and woodlands","Scientists have successfully resurrected Shieldon from Armor Fossils found in hardened clay. These fossils are in fact remnants of their sturdy face plates; so far, no part of their softer torsos have been discovered in the fossil record. They lived approximately 100,000,000 years ago, making them concurrent with Lileep, Anorith, Cranidos, Tirtouga, and Tyrunt (some scientists also contest that Amaura also were alive during this time, though fossil record examinations have returned inconclusive). Their faces plates are very hard and are their main form of defense against attackers. They live in forests and woodlands, feeding on Berries and grasses in sunlit clearings. Their hard faces make them difficult targets for most predators, who generally avoid them due to their impervious armor (even their fossils are usually unscathed). However, smarter predators likely noted that they were very vulnerable from behind and exploited that fact. Scientists have recently postulated that Shieldon used leaves and bark to shine their faces, using the glare of sunlight to disorient foes. They likely went extinct during an ice age that killed off most of the plants that they required for food.","Evolves into Bastiodon at Lvl 30","Rock","/","Steel"," 1'08\" | 0.5 m"," 125.7 lbs | 57.0 kg"," Monster"," Monster","

They are virtually invulnerable to frontal attacks, as their steel-hard faces can withstand immense damage. Though their rears and sides are not nearly as strong, they still are relatively tough compared to other species. Bastiodon live in herds of 30 or so members. They raise their young until adulthood. When their herds are threatened, Bastiodon will line up side by side and barricade their offspring; these impregnable walls easily defend Shieldon from most predators. This defense, however, is notably weak to aerial attacks. Because their fossils are often found together, it is believed Bastiodon frequently clashed with Rampardos. Their facial bones are so hard and oddly shaped that scientists once thought they were sort of horn or spike until the first Bastiodon was successfully resurrected. Despite their imposing size, Bastiodon are docile creatures. They spend most of their time traveling with their herds in search of Berries and grasses. They are thought to have died out due to an ice age; the cooling climate wiped out many plants, and their sluggishness and herd reliance made remaining lone Bastiodon easy targets for predators.","Evolves from Shieldon at Lvl 30","Rock","/","Steel"," 4'03\" | 1.3 m"," 329.6 lbs | 149.5 kg"," Monster"," Monster","

They are very susceptible to the weather, so they will scramble to cover themselves if exposed. Their cloaks keep them insulated in cold winds; in warmer weather, they shed the outer layers of their cloaks to keep from overheating. Burmy seem to always find something to cover themselves in, no matter how barren their surroundings. In battle, their cloaks often shed off, forcing them to construct new ones out of nearby materials, using their silk to bind things goether. In forests, they will often be found in leaves and twigs. Near rivers, they will veil themselves in sand and pebbles. In cities, they scavenge refuse and metal scraps to make cloaks. Burmy have been recorded using other materials, as they are surprisingly resourceful when it comes to cloaking themselves; feathers, flower petals, and even discarded insect parts have all been used to make their covers.","Sandy Cloak","Research Notes","Bug"," 0'08\" | 0.2 m"," 7.5 lbs | 3.4 kg"," Shed Skin |"," Bug"," Bug","

The variety of different cloaks Burmy use also transfers over to Wormadam. Like Burmy, most Wormadam are covered in either leaves and other plant materials, sand and gravel, or trash and metal scraps. However, these are hardly the only types of coverings found within the species. A Wormadam’s covering affects what attacks it can use in battle. Plant Cloak Wormadam can use leaves to execute Razor Leaf; Sandy Cloak Wormadam can utilize pebbles in Rock Blast; Steel Cloak Wormadam can manipulate metal scraps to use Mirror Shot. As Burmy alter the thickness of their cloaks to regulate their temperatures, Wormadam that evolve on cold days also tend to have thicker cloaks.","Sandy Cloak","Research Notes"," Bug/Grass if Plant Cloak, Bug/Ground if Sandy Cloak, Bug/Steel if Trash Cloak"," 0'08\" | 0.2 m"," 7.5 lbs | 3.4 kg"," Shed Skin |"," Bug"," Bug","

Mothim are nocturnal Pokémon, flitting about forests in search of floral honey. They have no stationary nests and are constantly on the move in search of food. Mothim rest wherever there is shelter, but do not return twice to the same place. Though their primary source of nutrition is honey, they are not well-adapted to obtain it themselves. Instead, they search for Combee hives around forests, sneakily stealing honey from them. This task is more difficult than it sounds, considering that Combee hives are actually made up of watchful Combee. It is thought that Mothim cloak themselves in a scent similar to that of Combee to avoid detection as they fill up on honey. Because they are active at night, when Combee tend to rely more on smell than sight to detect intruders, they can generally slip in unnoticed. This isn’t a guarantee, however, and it isn’t uncommon to see unlucky Mothim being attacked by huge swarms of Combee at night.","﻿Evolves from Burmy at Lvl 20 if maleCan also evolve into Wormadam at Lvl 20 if female","Research Notes"," Bug/Flying"," 2'11\" | 0.9 m"," 51.4 lbs | 23.3 kg"," Swarm |"," Bug"," Bug","

Combee spend the entire day flitting from flower to flower, collecting nectar. They turns this nectar into honey and take it back to Vespiquen. Combee eat just enough to survive, giving all of the surplus to their queens; each head has a slightly different nectar preference. They are diurnal; at night, Combee colonies rest by stacking their bodies together to form hives protecting the queen. Their hexagonal bodies allow no space for intruders to slip through when they stack together. About a third of the Combee in a hive will be awake at any given time, keeping watch over their colony. Combee will attack any potential threats, not hesitating to give their lives to protect their queens. Combee are entirely subservient to their queens’ orders; should the queens go missing, their colonies will fly about worriedly in search of them, not eating or resting until they are found.

Though capable of making honey, they rarely do so, relying on their Combee to bring back food for them. The six-celled undersides of their abdomens serve as nests for Combee grubs, which they (or rather, their workers) will protect at all costs. Conversely, the grubs will also protect their mothers with their lives. Much of the honey Vespiquen colonies collect goes towards feeding these offspring. There is only one Vespiquen in a hive; should another female Combee evolve, it will immediately be exiled by the reigning queen to form a new colony. The primary job of a Vespiquen is to birth and protect new Combee. When their colonies falter, Vespiquen can produce pheromones to command their grubs to do their bidding; they can use Attack Order to wear down foes, Defend Order to strengthen their own defenses, or Heal Order to replenish energy. Individuals with stronger pheromones can command a larger number of grubs more effectively. Vespiquen will repay outsiders who help defend their hives from attackers graciously with generous amounts of honey.

Their cheek pouches are responsible for their electricity, producing and distributing charge throughout their bodies. They are often seen rubbing cheek pouches together in an attempt to share their stored electricity. When endangered, they can fire bolts of electricity from their tails. Pachirisu eat nuts and Berries. They have a unique way of ​protecting their collected food; they save the fur they shed throughout the day, fashioning it into electrified furballs. When they stash food in tree hollows or the eaves of houses, they also throw in some of these puffs. If intruders attempt to steal food and touch a furball, they will instead get a nasty shock. When Pachirisu sleep, they curl their tails around to use as pillows. They are agile Pokémon that can of maneuver through tree branches with ease.","​Pokémon and all associated names and characters are trademarked and © 1995-2019 Nintendo. All non-original images are provided by Bulbapedia, © 1995-2019 Nintendo.No copyright infringement intended.","Research Notes","Electric"," 1'04\" | 0.4 m"," 8.6 lbs | 3.9 kg"," Run Away | Pickup |","Volt Absorb","Volt Absorb","

When inflated, they let Buizel rest with their heads above water, allowing them to sleep without fear of drowning (Buizel can hold their breaths for long periods of time, but must still surface to breathe). They also inflate their sacs to keep their heads afloat as they scan for prey. When Buizel dive, they deflate their sacs so they won’t rise back to the surface. They swim by spinning their two tails around like propellers. This method enables them to swim very quickly and cut through weeds that would normally slow them down. Their are primarily piscine, though they will also feed on bivalves as well. Young Buizel are very playful; they can  often seen splashing together in the water. They outgrow this behavior as they age, but still remain very friendly.

They deflate their flotation sacs to dive and use their twin tails to propel themselves. Scientists believe that Floatzel were once terrestrial Pokémon that adapted to aquatic life in order to catch underwater prey. This theory is supported by the fact that they can move around perfectly well on land, though they prefer to be in the water. Floatzel are often found around fishing ports, where they are seen as both nuisances and aids. On one hand, they sometimes snatch prey straight from the hooks of anglers. On the other, they can be helpful Pokémon, known to rescue drowning people and Pokémon by inflating their raft-like flotation sacs and carrying them to shore on their backs.  Generally, most anglers leave Floatzel alone because of this.","​﻿Evolves from Buizel at Lvl 26","Research Notes"," Water"," 3'07\" | 1.1 m"," 73.9 lbs | 33.5 kg"," Swift Swim |","Water Veil","Water Veil","

However, as they grow, the two heads compete for dominance, as they cannot photosynthesize enough nutrients to support them both. Eventually, one wins out, and the other withers away into a vestigial ball. The remaining heads then use their siblings to supplement their growth; the smaller heads are sweet and packed with nutrients, making them very popular treats for avian Pokémon like Starly. Though Cherubi can survive without their second heads, their growth will be severely stunted without the extra nutrients; thus, they protect these heads very fiercely, dashing away from would-be predators with surprising speed. If they don’t get enough sunlight, their vivid red coloration will dull, though it will intensify as they approach evolution. Once Cherubi have drained all of the nutrients they can from their second heads, they will bud and the heads will wither away; Cherubi are ready for evolution at this time. They are often seen on tree branches on warm, sunny days.

In this form, Cherrim are very active and excitable, basking fully in the sun’s rays by facing all of their petals towards it. They uses this precious time under the sun to photosynthesize as much energy as they can, since they are unable to do so in its other form. Cherrim also becomes stronger under the sunlight thanks to this extra energy. They can take down foes much larger than themselves by using powerful attacks like Solar Beam during this time. They can store large amounts of sugars in their bodies, which they use to endure long periods in the Overcast Form. In the Sunshine Form, they appear eternally joyful, while in Overcast Form they seem constantly gloomy.

"422","Shellos","422","Ocean shorelines, tidepools, tropical reefs","Shellos are unique in that they and Gastrodon have two variants, a pink West Sea form and a blue East Sea form. Scientists believe that they are currently undergoing allopatric speciation, a process in which geographic isolation causes two populations to evolve into separate species. It is theorized that the rise of Mt. Coronet in Sinnoh divided Shellos into two sides, each of which then began adapting to their new habitats while being cut off from those on the other side of the peak. Research shows that Shellos in more fertile waters are more vibrant in color; this suggests that their colorations may be influenced by diet, climate, or water temperature. It is theorized that pink West Sea Shellos are associated with warmer waters, and blue East Sea Shellos are associated with cooler waters. Though the two variants can still currently breed as one species, scientists believe that this may not be case in the future, when the two forms may not even recognize each other as related. Shellos can extend their necks very far to reach algae and plankton in difficult places. When squeezed, they will ooze a slippery purple fluid analogous to mammalian sweat. This substance makes it difficult for predators to grasp them so they can flee. They can similarly exude a sticky, but harmless purple goo to slow attackers. Shellos also have remarkable regenerative qualities, and researchers are currently studying their cellular properties in order to discover the biological mechanism behind this.","East Sea","Research Notes","Water"," 1'00\" | 0.3 m"," 13.9 lbs | 6.3 kg"," Sticky Hold | Storm Drain |","Sand Force","Sand Force","

Scientists believe that Gastrodon once had shells like their relatives Cloyster based on DNA evidence. They likely lost their shells to adapt to habitats where the needed calcium was scarce, though they still maintain a thin but hard plate vestigial beneath their skin. Like Shellos, Gastrodon ooze a slick purple fluid when hurt to make themselves slippery. This substance is also very bitter and renders their meat nearly inedible. They have superb regenerative skills and can grow back torn-off parts of their bodies. They are pliable because they lack skeletal systems, letting them into squeeze into tight spaces.

They use their tails to deftly peel fruit and shuck nuts; rinds and shells often litter the ground below trees where Ambipom colonies dwell. They also use their tails to swing from branch to branch, and are capable of suspending themselves from branches using their tails as they eat or play. They can sometimes be seen “holding hands” as they link their tails together in rings. This gesture is a sign of peace and friendship amongst a colony. They communicate by holding tails with each other and making different gestures with them. In battle, Ambipom nimbly manipulate their two tails to attack foes with moves like Double Hit; many opponents find it very difficult to dodge both of their consecutive attacks.

Drifblim float in large groups across clear skies; during the daytime, they are often drowsy and lethargic, aloof to the weather and environment around them. They become more active at dusk, however. Mysteriously, entire groups of Drifblim seem to simply disappear when observed; no one knows where they go or how they vanish so suddenly, though according to folklore they are in fact traveling across the boundary to the spirit realm.

"434","Stunky","434","Forests, woodlands","Stunky are famous for being able to spray a noxious liquid from their rear ends. The smell is so horrid that Pokémon (and people) will refuse to go near anyone or anything that has been sprayed. In the past, people used Stunky fluids in place of modern Repels to keep wild Pokémon away, at the cost of smelling horrendous until the smell wore off. Once sprayed, it can take a full 24 hours for the stench to dissipate; the odor can be detected from up to 1.25 miles (2 kilometers) away. Stunky spray their fluid only as a defense mechanism; they can only shoot about a half-dozen times before having to recharge their scent glands, a process that can take up to a week. To make up for this, they will first give off a variety of warning signals to scare foes off without shooting; they will hiss, stamp their feet, and then finally raise their tails before spraying. Stunky will aim for the face, and can spray from up to 16 feet (5 meters) away. After being doused once, most foes learn to recognize the warnings and flee before getting doused. Oddly, Stunky seem to be unharmed by Combee swarms, walking right through them unfazed when searching for Honey.","﻿Evolves into Skuntank at Lvl 34","Research Notes","/"," 1'04\" | 0.4 m"," 42.3 lbs | 19.2 kg"," Stench | Aftermath |","Keen Eye","Keen Eye","

"435","Skuntank","435","Forests, woodlands","Unlike their pre-evolutions, Skuntank have scent glands on the tips of their tails rather than the bases. This enables them to aim at foes much better, since they can actually see where they are shooting. Skuntank can spray their noxious fluids from a distance of over 160 feet (50 meters). Unlike Stunky, however, the smell doesn’t wear off after a day or so; instead, it only worsens the longer the liquid is allowed to fester on it target. The exact odor varies based on the Skuntank's diet. In older times, crushed Tamato Berries were the most popular remedy for Skuntank stench; while effective, the berries are also extraordinarily spicy and irritating to the skin and eyes. Modern Poké Marts usually carry Skuntank deodorant in areas where the Pokémon are found. As a side effect of their forward-oriented tails, Skuntank cannot see upwards very well, and are thus very susceptible to aerial attacks. The fluid produced by their scent glands is highly flammable; Skuntank can ignite the spurts of liquid that they spray in order to use the move Flamethrower in battle, much to the surprise of many opponents. Skuntank dig their nests into flat ground, marking the surrounding area to warn intruders of their presence.","﻿Evolves from Stunky at Lvl 34","Research Notes","Dark/Poison"," 3'03\" | 1.0 m"," 83.8 lbs | 38.0 kg"," Stench | Aftermath |","Keen Eye","Keen Eye","

Archaeologists have discovered bronze tools shaped like Bronzor buried in ancient Sinnohian tombs; no one is quite sure what the connection is, but some believe that ancient societies thought that Bronzor had some kind of mystical power and tried to replicate it through their implements. The herb-shaped pattern on their backs, it was said, is what held their power. Researchers speculate that the plant-like design indicate that Bronzor had some connection with harvests and fertility. Others believe that in the past, they reflected like mirrors, their mysterious powers letting onlookers gaze into the past. It is said that a shined Bronzor will always reflect the truth, though the Pokémon dislike being polished. Bafflingly, when scientists attempted to take an X-ray of a Bronzor to examine its body structure, the image came out blank. Alternative research attempting to solve the many mysteries surrounding them has also turned up inconclusive. In popular culture, many believe that Bronzor cannot be harmed by fire. This is untrue, though some Bronzor do seem to resist flames somewhat.","﻿Evolves into Bronzong at Lvl 33","Research Notes","/"," 1'08\" | 0.5 m"," 133.4 lbs | 19.2 kg"," Levitate | Heatproof |","Heavy Metal","Heavy Metal","

It was buried deep beneath the surface, along with various other ancient artifacts (including Bronzor-shaped implements). Upon further examination, scientists concluded that it had been “asleep” for about 2,000 years. Historians believe that Bronzong were once revered as “bringers of plentiful harvests;” ancient civilizations thought that by ringing their gong-like bells, Bronzong could open portals to other dimensions and summon rain clouds. People would ​leave out offerings and complete ritualistic dances in hopes of appeasing these Pokémon during poor weather. In battle, Bronzong appear to be able to utilize this ability through the move Rain Dance. Like Bronzor, some Bronzong appear to demonstrate an odd resistance to fire. Bronzong can undergo long periods of dormancy. When in this state, their eyes turn white, they stop floating, and they become immobile.

"438","Bonsly","438","Forests, mountains","Bonsly thrive in arid environments, as their bodies cannot tolerate much moisture. However, they stand out starkly against dull backgrounds, so they tend to camouflage with trees in wooded areas (albeit away from streams). They sometimes wander into parks for similar reasons; one may occasionally see Bonsly fleeing from gardens when sprinkler systems turn on. Bonsly are often found “crying;” in fact, they are not upset, but rather regulating their moisture levels by excreting excess fluids out of their eyes. They in fact exude two types of fluids this way. The first is salty and similar in composition to human sweat. The other is much more astringent, and is used as a bittering agent in some cuisines. The more humid their surroundings, the more they will weep. In battle, this skill also goads enemies into letting their guards down. Bonsly are relatively skilled at mimicking trees, capable of remaining still for long periods of time. They dig small holes in the ground and bury themselves halfway, posing as small saplings. Like Sudowoodo, however, attempting to water them will cause them to uproot and scamper away. When threatened, Bonsly will try to flee, but may throw themselves at foes as a last resort. Due to their weight, this can be a very painful maneuver.

They are notable for relying heavily on humans, performing in front of audiences in exchange for food. They are can be mimics, potentially able to perfect copying the facial expressions and body movements of people and Pokémon. By doing so, they are also able to gain insight into their emotions; Mime Jr. may take advantage of this by focusing on more benevolent, compassionate spirits during their performances in hopes of earning more food. However, they make mistakes often, which will break the illusion. If attacked, they will mimic foes to confuse them, fleeing before they have a chance to react. If attackers are unfazed by their displays, they can also erect invisible barriers like their evolutions to keep them away. In battle, their ability to imitate opponents allows them to use moves like Mimic and Copycat against foes. One may occasionally find Mime Jr. scavenging through dumpsters in search of food; these Pokémon are known to raid trash bins when they fail to earn enough through performing. When Mime Jr. successfully enrapture a crowd through skilled mimicking, they may become so elated that they forget they were putting on an act to begin with, and continuing mimicking their subjects long after the end of their performances.

They are most commonly found, however, with white, smooth, oval-shaped rocks in their pouches; they love round, white objects in general, and will carry them around in their pouches in imitation of their evolutions. The more the stones resemble eggs, the more valuable they are to them. Pebbles perfectly shaped and colored like eggs are known as Oval Stones; these are necessary to facilitate their evolutions into Chansey. They will hoard multiple of such objects if given the opportunity, sometimes becoming so heavy that they can no longer move. Taking a stone from a Happiny will upset it greatly and cause it to throw a tantrum, however--even if the weight of the stone is preventing it from walking properly. Happiny are very conscious about the curls of hair on their heads and will visit bodies of water to clean and adjust them as needed. Despite their sizes, Happiny are deceptively strong, capable of lifting heavy objects much larger than themselves. They have a quirky tendency to wander right between the feet of larger people and Pokémon, causing them to stumble. When Happiny make new friends, they will give them their stones as signs of trust; refusing the stones will greatly anger them, as doing so is a sign of disrespect to Happiny.","Evolves into Chansey when leveled while holding an Oval StoneChansey evolves into Blissey with high happiness","Normal"," 2'00\" | 0.6 m"," 53.8 lbs | 24.4 kg"," Natural Cure | Serene Grace |"," Friend Guard"," Undiscovered"," Undiscovered","

Chatot use this ability to avoid predators and fool prey; by mimicking their targets, they can pretend to be members of the same species and thus avoid detection. Chatot have great memories and can remember any sound they hear. They add these noises to their repertoires, which they can pull out of to construct and sing patchwork melodies. They swing their tails back and forth like metronomes keep time. If many Chatot gather together, they will learn and repeat whatever the first one says until they all are saying the same thing. In battle, they can use Chatter to both deafen and confuse foes. These intelligent Pokémon can learn by observation and experience; for example, they may scare foes away by copying the cries of their predators, or draw prey closer by producing corresponding mating calls.","​Pokémon and all associated names and characters are trademarked and © 1995-2019 Nintendo. All non-original images are provided by Bulbapedia, © 1995-2019 Nintendo.No copyright infringement intended.","Research Notes","Normal","/Flying"," 1'08\" | 0.5 m"," 4.2 lbs | 1.9 kg"," "," ","

The Odd Keystone can be seen at the bases of their bodies, with their “faces” rushing out of fissures on their sides. The keystones are said to prevent any of the spirits from causing misfortune ever again; should they ever be released, they would wreak havoc on the world and its inhabitants. While Spiritomb can extend their faces short distances from their keystones, they ultimately are tethered to them wherever they go. This doesn’t stop them, however, from taking out their anger at being imprisoned on anything near them. The circular areas around their keystones are almost always devoid of any life whatsoever.

Long ago, they used to dwell in tropical areas, but they eventually adapted to farther (though still sweltering) latitudes. They are now found in caverns heated by geothermal activity and sun-baked badlands with little rainfall. Gible builds nests by digging small holes horizontally into the sides of cave walls. They wait for prey to pass by before instinctually pouncing onto and then biting them with their powerful jaws. Their jaws are spectacularly strong for their sizes; as a consequence of this, however, they will sometimes injure themselves or chip their teeth from the sheer force of their own biting. These injuries rarely bother them, as they have a high threshold for pain. Though solitary, Gible are not territorial; they play-fight with other Gible and will huddle together in cold weather to stay warm. Their dorsal fins are strong enough to support adult men. When rubbed one way, their skin feels as smooth as rubber, but when rubbed the other way, it feels as rough as sandpaper. They are not very nimble, as their stubby limbs make them rather clumsy when walking; this is likely why they are ambush predators.","﻿Evolves into Gabite at Lvl 24Gabite evolves into Garchomp at Lvl 48","Research Notes","Dragon/Ground"," 2'04\" | 0.7 m"," 45.2 lbs | 20.5 kg"," Sand Veil |","Rough Skin","Rough Skin","

They will dig into cave walls in search of jewels (and Carbink), hoarding them in large piles in their nests. Gabite nests are constantly targeted by thieves due to the immense value of the jewels they hold. However, their hostility make infiltrating their nests a very difficult task. They will remain motionless for hours at a time keeping an eye on their hoards. Research shows that only Sableye, thanks to their stealthiness, can successfully and consistently sneak in and out of Gabite nests to snatch and eat gems; the victimized Gabite will give ferocious and relentless chase to them if spotted, however. Gabite scales are thought to have medicinal properties. Some people believe that grinding the scales and then consuming the resulting powder will cure any illness. Though illegal to sell, the difficulty of obtaining these scales make them very valuable on the black market in many regions.

In flight, the scales are oriented in such a way that they reduce drag. When rubbed in the opposite direction, on the other hand, their skin is rough enough to leave minor cuts. Garchomp are very aggressive and territorial, not hesitating to attack intruders with the powerful Dragon Claw. Travelers that must pass through their territory should bring along a few Yache Berries as a precautionary measure; Garchomp can be calmed by the Berries for short periods of time, possibly long enough for trainers to escape unharmed. Their head growths help them detect heat signatures to hunt down distant prey; they are known to dive into flocks of bird Pokémon and swallow them whole.

In fact, a Munchlax sharing its possibly-rotten stored food with someone is a sure sign of trust.

They wade through sand with most of their bodies submerged, only leaving their eyes poking above the surface. They can travel in this manner just as efficiently as other Pokémon would walking. When Hippopotas wade through sand, they walk with their mouths open and their nostrils shut, surfacing every so often to breathe. They essentially filter-feed this way, catching prey hiding in the sand and then expelling the grains out from their pores; because of this, they are constantly cloaked in veils of swirling sand. The cloaks help keep germs away and also make it more difficult for predators to spot them.

Pods do not seem to develop close bonds, however, and individuals tend to act on their own during day-to-day activities. Curiously, these ferocious creatures have a mutualistic relationship with tiny Dwebble; Dwebble help dislodge stones that get stuck in the pores of Hippowdon, and then can use the stones to make their shells.

They can go up to a year without food and can similarly survive for long periods of time without water. Skorupi that dwell in wetter environments can sometimes be found perched on stones bathed in direct sunlight, drying and warming their bodies. In deserts, they may burrow into the sand to stay cool during the sweltering daytime. It was recently discovered that Skorupi glow a striking electric blue when exposed to ultraviolet light. What purpose this serves is as of yet unknown, but some speculate that it may have to do with being able to detect others of their kind in the darkness; it is possible that Skorupi can see ultraviolet light, though further research must be done to confirm this speculation.","﻿Evolves into Drapion at Lvl 40","Research Notes","/"," 2'07\" | 0.8 m"," 26.5 lbs | 12.0 kg"," Battle Armor | Sniper |","Keen Eye","Keen Eye","

They take advantage of these moments to jab enemies with their poisonous fingers, which are toxic enough to kill smaller Pokémon upon contact. Croagunk can also spray poison straight out of their fingertips. Despite the poison’s toxicity, it is in fact an important ingredient in many folk remedies for lower back pain.

Victims approach expecting fruit or nectar, but instead are met with their jaws, which can shut closed in the blink of an eye. Once Carnivine manage to chomp down on victims, it can take a whole day for them to digest their prey, depending on its size. They can open their jaws 180º, acting like landing pads of sorts for aerial prey. They tend to dwell in areas with soil that is acidic and nutrient-poor; scientists hypothesize that they evolved to be carnivorous in order to cope with this.

This has earned them the nickname, “The Beautifly of the Sea.” They may leap out of the water when swimming, though this makes them easy targets for aerial predators. In some areas, freshwater populations of Finneon have been discovered. Some postulate that these Finneon may eventually evolve into an entirely separate species, though at this time this is not yet the case.","﻿Evolves into Lumineon at Lvl 31","Research Notes","Water"," 1'04\" | 0.4 m"," 15.4 lbs | 7.0 kg"," Swift Swim | Storm Drain |","Water Veil","Water Veil","

They are now able to produce their own bioluminescence and do not have to rely on the sun to gather energy. Lumineon flash light patterns on their four tail fins to attract prey; deep sea explorers have described the sight of schools of Lumineon flashing in the abyss to be akin to skies full of stars. This light also attracts predators, though; to avoid detection, they “walk” on the sea floor by using their pelvic fins as “legs,” sneaking beneath most attackers. In the deep, Lumineon’s main competitors for food are Lanturn, who are also bioluminescent hunters. The electrical powers of Lanturn put Lumineon at a disadvantage, so the latter will generally avoid confrontation with them. Curiously, perhaps due to their Beautifly-like wings, Lumineon can use a few Bug-type moves like Silver Wind in battle. They court mates by completing intricate dances involving flashing lights and flapping fins with their partners before mating.","﻿Evolves from Finneon at Lvl 31","Research Notes","Water"," 3'11\" | 1.2 m"," 52.9 lbs | 24.0 kg"," Swift Swim | Storm Drain |","Water Veil","Water Veil","

"458","Mantyke","458","Sunlit open ocean","Mantyke are very active, friendly Pokémon. They are most commonly found swimming besides or even within schools of Remoraid, skimming the surface of the water like jet skis. The patterns on their backs differ from region to region; due to their curious, playful natures, they will often approach ships to examine them, allowing passengers to glimpse their patterns. In fact, Mantyke-watching tours are common in some regions, with tourists paying money to observe them frolicking with schools of Remoraid. In some regions, swimming with them is also a popular activity for visitors. These Pokémon use their antennae to detect changes in water currents. As filter feeders, they follow these currents to find areas abundant in plankton. Once a Mantyke grow large enough, a Remoraid will attach itself to the undersides of one of its wings. It is only when this occurs that Mantyke can evolve; how this happens is as of yet unknown, though some believe that Remoraid secrete an enzyme that signals for evolution; Mantine are far less vulnerable to predators due to their size, so evolving their hosts would greatly benefit attached Remoraid. In colder regions such as Galar, these Pokémon become noticeably more sluggish in their behavior.","﻿Evolves into Mantine when leveled up with Remoraid in the party","Research Notes","Water","/Flying"," 3'03\" | 1.0 m"," 143.3 lbs | 65.0 kg"," Water Veil"," Water Veil","

"459","Snover","459","Boreal forests, snowy mountain peaks","Snover generally live far away from humans, high up on snowy mountain peaks or deep in cold boreal forests. They are very inquisitive of people, however, and will approach human travelers with great curiosity. Large numbers of them will congregate around human footprints, attempting to discern where they came from. Snover migrate with the seasons; in the winter, they make their way down chilly mountain slopes, as the cooler weather enables them to dwell at lower altitudes. It is during this time where human contact is most likely. Once the weather warms again in the spring, they trek back up to their mountain peaks. Their bodies also grow edible white fruits along the borders of the white and brown areas of their torsos in the spring, described to taste like frozen candy; they are a favorite of Galarian Darumaka. In battle, Snover can summon blizzards that obscure the vision of foes with fog-like flurries of snow. Once their opponents are blinded, they will launch balls of ice at them before they have a chance to retaliate. In particularly harsh weather, these Pokémon will root themselves deep beneath the soil to weather strong winds as well as absorb nutrients and warm water from below, regulating their temperatures.","﻿Evolves into Abomasnow at Lvl 40","Research Notes","/"," 3'03\" | 1.0 m"," 111.3 lbs | 50.5 kg"," Snow Warning |","Soundproof","Soundproof","

For a long time, they were thought to be myths, going by names like “abominable snowmen,” “yetis,” and, most recently, “Ice Monsters.” Based on recent findings, Abomasnow likely only appear when snow flowers in their habitat bloom, for reasons unknown. Once the last petal falls, these Pokémon retreat back to some undiscovered location, not appearing again until the next bloom. Abomasnow can whip up terrible blizzards that make it virtually impossible to see; this is likely how they keep themselves hidden. They live exclusively on mountains perpetually covered in snow; whether Abomasnow choose to dwell in snowy areas or make the area they live in snowy is debatable. These Pokémon are surprisingly quiet, making little to no noise during their everyday lives. No clear photos of these Pokémon in the wild exist so far, due to the heavy snow that constantly surrounds them. It is said that though elusive, these Pokémon will appear to protect endangered Snover with their raging blizzards and hammer-like arms.","﻿Evolves from Snover at Lvl 40​Can Mega Evolve into Mega Abomasnow","Research Notes","/"," 7'03\" | 2.2 m"," 298.7 lbs | 135.5 kg"," Snow Warning |","Soundproof","Soundproof","

They are devious and intelligent hunters, capable of devising and executing complex plans with their allies to take down foes much larger than themselves; they have even been recording hunting giant Mamoswine. They never bicker over splitting catches. To communicate, Weavile scratch markings into the frost covering trees and boulders, signaling when, where, and how to attack. Over 500 distinct markings as known. They also use these scratches to mark the boundaries of their domains. Weavile will work together to surround foes from all sides before closing in on their quarries. One Weavile may surprise the intended prey and pin it down to expose a vulnerable area while the others then strike in unison. Their main assets are their stunning agility and their razor-sharp claws, which are cold enough to inflict frostbite with their scratches. They attack foes with moves like Night Slash before they have a chance to react. Weavile also have excellent vision, letting them see even in strong blizzards. In battle, one of their claws may occasionally break off. These claws will grow back in time, though it may take up to a month to do so. The broken claws, known as Razor Claws, can be used to facilitate the evolutions of Sneasel.","Evolves from Sneasel when leveled up at night while holding a Razor Claw","Ice","/","Dark"," 3'07\" | 1.1 m"," 75.0 lbs | 34.0 kg"," Pickpocket"," Pickpocket","

Their three magnetic apparatuses (known as “units”) generate their own magnetic fields, which Magnezone can harness in attacks like Magnet Rise and Magnetic Flux. Sometimes, when two Magnezone come together, their magnetism will be so strong that neither will be able to move; it takes an external force to separate the two. Though rare in the wild, Magnezone can be territorial; they prefer to use magnetism to repel foes rather than attack them outright. Their magnetic forces are strong enough to lift an adult human strapped into a metal harness. Strangely, Magneton can currently only evolve into Magnezone in natural magnetic fields; scientific attempts to trigger evolution through artificially generated ones have all failed. Because of their shape, many mistake floating Magnezone for UFOs. These creatures do seem to be receiving and transmitting unknown signals with their antennae, however; they also emit radar signals from these antennae to monitor their territory, honing in and blasting intruders with beams of energy.","Evolves from Magnemite at Lvl 30Evolves from Magneton when leveled up in an area of magnetic activity","Electric","/","Steel"," 3'11\" | 1.2 m"," 396.8 lbs | 180.0 kg"," Analytic"," Analytic","

It appears to be a cocktail of many different, complex substances. The drool also contains a compound that causes numbness upon contact; this sensation does not fade on its own and requires medical attention to cure. The numbing substance appears to have a dulling effect on nerves under the skin, leading to the loss of feeling in affected areas. Their tongues are extremely long; they capture prey by constricting victims ​with their tongues like ropes as their saliva begins to dissolve and paralyze them. The current record-holding Lickilicky has a tongue that just barely extends over 82 feet (25 m). Their first instinct when they come across something unfamiliar is to lick it, as they associate and remembers things based on their textures and tastes. Consequently, drawing too close to Lickilicky may lead to becoming drenched in saliva. Their tongues are in fact quite dextrous, and are used to pick up small objects in place of their clumsier hands. Their mouths are very spacious, as they have enough room for their rolled-up tongues to fit within. Additionally, they have wells in their mouths to hold and store excess saliva.","Evolves from Lickitung when leveled while knowing Rollout","Normal"," 5'07\" | 1.7 m"," 308.6 lbs | 140.0 kg"," Own Tempo | Oblivious |"," Cloud Nine"," Monster"," Monster","

They sometimes make their way into artificial quarries to use the mined stone in battle. They can shove rocks into the holes in their hands; by quickly tightening and expanding their arm muscles, they can launch out these rocks like missiles. This is how they use devastating moves like Rock Wrecker to overpower opponents. Sometimes, they may launch Geodude or Roggenrola camouflaging as boulders, mistaking them for real rocks. Their durable carapaces are capable of withstanding volcanic eruptions. In battle, they will often wait for the foe to strike first, letting the attacks bounce harmlessly off of their bodies before counterattacking with their drills. Rhyperior also use these drills to dig through mountains and cliffs. They can then use the rubble as more ammo for their attacks. If threatened without any rocks available, they are still more than capable of defending themselves. Rhyperior can use their powerful drills to use Horn Drill, for instance, to take down foes. They can also swing their club-like tails at opponents when threatened; their immense weight often makes such blows crippling, if not outright fatal.","﻿Evolves from Rhyhorn at Lvl 42Evolves from Rhydon through trade with a Protector","Ground/Rock"," 7'10\" | 2.4 m"," 623.5 lbs | 282.8 kg"," Lightning Rod | Solid Rock  |"," Reckless"," Monster | Field"," Monster | Field","

They patiently wait for prey to wander by before ensnaring them with their long vines. These vines are surprisingly genetically similar to kelp. They grow at an amazing rate; during the warm springtime, the vines grow so quickly that it becomes impossible to see the eyes or feet of these Pokémon. Their arms also appear to be modified bunches of vines. They are capable of extending to twice their normal size, as much of their length is actually stored within the tangles of vines covering up the rest of the Pokémon’s bodies. Tangrowth rarely need to move, as they can bind and carry things they needs directly to them. Their vines have spectacular regenerative properties. Should predators bite off one of their arms, for example, Tangrowth would be able to grow them back quickly with no noticeable differences. In fact, they may even break off strands of their own, wriggling vines to distract foes as they flee; the vines will simply regrow later.","Evolves from Tangela when leveled while knowing Ancient Power","Grass"," 6'07\" | 2.0 m"," 283.5 lbs | 128.6 kg"," Chlorophyll | Leaf Guard |"," Regenerator"," Grass"," Grass","

"466","Electivire","466","Power plants, fields","Electivire tend to be short-tempered, aggressive Pokémon. They also often act brashly without consequences; they are known to charge headfirst into the attacks of foes while attempting to land blows of their own. Electivire fry opponents to a crisp by touching their two tails to them; doing so completes the circuit between the tails, causing 20,000 volts of electricity to surge through their foes. They can also grab their own tails to charge up their fists and deliver electrifying punches. As they attack, blue sparks may be seen sparking through their two horns.  Electivire are very rare Pokémon in the wild, as their evolutions require a tremendous and sudden surge of electrical energy. This normally can only be achieved through the use of Electirizers to store the necessary energy. Lightning strikes have been known to trigger evolution in Electabuzz, however; additionally, some Electabuzz feeding at power plants have been recorded to siphon enough electricity to evolve, generally at the cost of compromising the power grids in the local areas. Conversely, a single Electivire can also produce enough electricity to power a city if harnessed properly.

Evolution from Magmar normally requires the tremendous heat energy packed within Magmarizers, though natural evolutions involving eruptions have also been recorded. Magmortar are exclusively found deep within active volcanic craters capable of producing the immense heat they need; a single pair of mates will call a whole crater its own. To defend themselves, Magmortar can launch fireballs reaching temperatures of 3,600°F (2,000°C) from their cannon-like arms. When they do so, the sheer, blistering heat makes them briefly glow a whitish hue; they may even begin to melt their own arms when attacking (though magma will heal them). As this incinerates the opponent to a crisp, however, they rarely use this when hunting prey. Even their breaths are very hot, audibly sizzling when they exhale. These breaths can sear meat within seconds and have been known to start forest fires in drier areas. Despite their potential dangers, Magmortar are not a very aggressive species, likely due to having few threats in their volcanic homes; they generally will not attack unless provoked. In some older factories, Magmortar are still used to process raw metals.","Magby evolves into Magmar at Lvl 30Evolves from Magmar through trade with an Magmarizer","Fire"," 5'03\" | 1.6 m"," 149.9 lbs | 68.0 kg"," Flame Body |"," Vital Spirit"," Human-Like"," Human-Like","

These Pokémon are highly intelligent and very in tune to the emotions of others. They are capable of recognizing the facial expressions and social cues of people and Pokémon alike, and will react to them accordingly. Little is known about how they mate or raise young in the wild, due to their elusiveness. Most wild Togepi are produced by Togetic. However, from studies of the species in captivity, it is likely that Togekiss mate for life and raise their offspring until they evolve and can leave the nest on their own. Both parents are thought to spend equal amounts of time raising their children. In the past few decades or so, sightings of wild Togekiss have become even less frequent than they have been in the past.

For example, they can rapidly beat their wings to create shock waves strong enough to dislodge trees; such blasts can easily cause internal injuries in surrounding life. They are also skilled at using their powerful jaws to tear apart foes in mid-flight. In battle, these tactics manifest as moves like Sonic Boom and Bug Bite. Yanmega are strong enough to carry adult humans into the air. They use the wings on their tails to keep balanced while flying.

Because of this, Leafeon are always cloaked in pure, fresh air. They can often be seen taking naps in sunlit clearings near clear streams, storing energy for the rest of the day. When the weather gets cloudy, Leafeon may consume Berries to tide themselves over until better weather, but they cannot survive entirely without the sun. They are pacifists that avoid confrontation at all costs. Though they can sharpen their tails and strike back with moves like Leaf Blade, they rarely do so except in dire situations or to protect their friends. Still, the cutting edges of their leaves are sharp enough to slice a tree in half. Leafeon can become ill from trips into polluted cities, as they normally are surrounded by clean air. Similarly, they cannot tolerate prolonged deprivation from sunlight. Because of this, most Leafeon trainers tend to dwell in or near rural communities or forests. Young Leafeon are said to smell like fresh grass, while older ones smell like fallen leaves.

They can then tackle or fire these needles at foes. They can drop their body temperature as low as -75°F (-60°C). Glaceon can freeze the surrounding moisture by cooling their bodies, creating beautiful flurries of suspended ice crystals. The flurries sparkle like diamonds in the sunlight. They use the glittering mist to cloak themselves from attackers, letting them flee while their foes are distracted. Alternatively, they can also freeze air moisture into larger pellets to shoot at enemies. Unlike most Pokémon that live in cold areas, their fur is not very thick. In fact, their bodies are often colder than the surrounding air, which is what lets them to freeze water vapor by absorbing ambient heat. In battle, Glaceon can launch the powerful Blizzard to freeze foes.

Scientists already knew that Mamoswine could hibernate for long periods of time and withstand subzero temperatures (thanks to their thick fur and insulating blubber), but the frozen specimen was a testament to their hardiness. Their tusks are made of pure ice, fortunately making the already-rare Pokémon undesirable to poachers. In colder climates, these tusks grow even larger and more impressive.

They can then use this information to determine where metal is most abundant and begin making their gradual ways to such areas. Probopass can also use these units to pester attackers and drive them away; since they can control each of their Mini-Noses individually, they can harass foes from three directions at once (four, if one includes the Probopass themselves) to make up for their own sluggishness.

"479","Rotom","479","Urban areas","Rotom are mischievous Pokémon that enjoy playing pranks on others. They have the unique ability to possess electronic devices and use them as they please; oftentimes, this means causing them to malfunction or act unexpectedly to bewilder users. Their bodies are composed almost entirely of plasma, giving them their electrical abilities. Recent research has led to a promising discovery; their ability to possess electrical appliances could possibly help power a unique motor that would work far more efficiently than any design that currently exists. Indeed, there has been much progress in the development of new and improved Rotom-efficient appliances. In battle, while their Electric-typings remain constant throughout all of their forms, their other type can be influenced by the machine they are possessing. While trained Rotom can possess electronics and leave them entirely unharmed, wild ones tend to short out the circuits of devices they enter. They appear to have affinities for old televisions; they will briefly flash their maniacally grinning faces for just a split second before returning to standard programming to frighten watchers. ","Heat Form","Research Notes"," Electric/Ghost (Electric/Fire if Heat Form, Electric/Water if Wash Form,  Electric/Ice if Frost Form, Electric/Flying if Fan Form, Electric/Grass if Mow Form)"," 1'00\" | 0.3 m"," 0.7 lbs | 0.3 kg"," Levitate","Habitat","Habitat","

"480","Uxie","480","Museums, libraries, schools","The rich mythology of the Sinnoh region has ingrained the three lake guardians—Uxie, Mesprit, and Azelf—with the success of humanity as a species. Uxie is known as “The Being of Knowledge” and is said to have been created by Arceus to gift humans with intellect; its creation was also the birth of knowledge as a concept. It was this that enabled humans to solve problems and improve their lives. Uxie is believed to reside in Sinnoh’s Acuity Cavern, though it is thought to venture out to places where people come to learn—schools and libraries, for example. As Uxie gifted humans with knowledge, it can also take it away; Uxie will open its eyes when threatened to wipe the memories of those who gaze into them. It is also able to teleport itself and others and as leave its physical body temporarily as a spirit. Legend has it that if one manages to capture and extract the jewels of the lake guardians and link them, the resulting Red Chain will be able to control any being in the world, commanding its thoughts, emotions, and actions.","​A lake guardian, alongside Mesprit and Azelf","Psychic"," 1'00\" | 0.3 m"," 0.7 lbs | 0.3 kg"," Levitate"," Undiscovered","Overview","Overview","

It is said that when Arceus created Mesprit, the concept of emotions was also born. Mesprit gifted humans with the ability to feel, and as such is known as “The Being of Emotion.” It rests in or around Verity Cavern in Sinnoh; it is said that a person experiencing passionate emotions may see its spirit shimmering on the surface of Verity Lake. It also is thought to make its way to places where humans tend to ​express their feelings most opening, joyful (like at festivals) or sad (like at memorials). People say that anyone who dares touch Mesprit will be robbed of all emotions and left unable to feel anything at all. It is thought that the jewels on Mesprit’s body can be combined with its siblings’ into the Red Chain, which can control any being in existence. Only the most evil-hearted being in the world, however, would be able to commit such a vile act.","​A lake guardian, alongside Uxie and Azelf","Psychic"," 1'00\" | 0.3 m"," 0.7 lbs | 0.3 kg"," Levitate"," Undiscovered","Overview","Overview","

It may also venture out into isolated areas that would take travelers tremendous determination to reach: mountain peaks, remote islands, and dangerous cliffs, for example. This is because Azelf is “The Being of Willpower,” created by Arceus along with the concept of determination. It gifted humans with the strength to endure hardships and weather pain. Like its siblings, it is able to teleport itself and others as well as temporarily leave its body as a spirit. Those who dare to try to harm Azelf will find themselves unable to move, having lost all willpower to do anything at all. In Sinnoh mythology, the three lake guardians were all born from the same egg. Extracting and linking Azelf’s gems with the other guardians’ is said create the Red Chain; the object is reviled in legends for going against everything Pokémon training stands for. By robbing the victim of its ability to make its own decisions, the Red Chain would destroy a critical bond dating back centuries.","​A lake guardian, alongside Uxie and Mesprit","Psychic"," 1'00\" | 0.3 m"," 0.7 lbs | 0.3 kg"," Levitate"," Undiscovered","Overview","Overview","

This Pokémon is worshipped as an ancient deity in Sinnoh. It is believed to have the power to stop, start, slow down, and speed up time. Additionally, it is said to be able to freely travel temporally. Dialga is believed to dwell in a dimension separate from this world, and is ​thought to be capable of interdimensional travel. It is said to be constantly fighting with Palkia in this alternate dimension for control of the entire physical world. Sinnoh legend states that catastrophic consequences would follow if Dialga ever entered this world; the only way to subdue this Pokémon once it is angered is to enlist the help of the lake guardians; only a being with great knowledge, emotion, and willpower would be able to quell this rampaging beast.","​Also see Palkia and Giratina","Steel/Dragon"," 17'09\" | 5.4 m"," 1505.8 lbs | 683.0 kg"," Pressure | Telepathy"," Undiscovered","Overview","Overview","

This allows it to travel anywhere in an instant, including through dimensions. According to Sinnoh legend, space becomes more stable with every breath that Palkia takes. In fact, the region’s folklore states that space was only created once Palkia was born. Palkia is thought to reside in a separate dimension, along with its counterpart Dialga. It is believed to be in constant conflict with Dialga for control over both space and time, and thus the physical world as a whole. It is said that in its quest to defeat Dialga, Palkia may make its way into this realm, where it will wreak tremendous havoc. The only way to calm the enraged Pokémon would be to request the aid of the three lake guardians, as it would take a being that possesses great knowledge, willpower, and emotion to undertake such a daunting task.","​Also see Dialga and Giratina","Water/Dragon"," 13'09\" | 4.9 m"," 740.8 lbs | 336.0 kg"," Pressure | Telepathy"," Undiscovered","Overview","Overview","

Its body is made of hard steel; however, the immense temperature of its surroundings has deformed parts of its body and completely melted others. Heatran’s blood is constantly boiling from the heat of its environment, only contributing to its own melting; its blood is almost as hot as the magma around it. This Pokémon’s insides are so hot that when it opens its mouth, an orange glow can be seen emanating from within. Its cross-shaped feet are adept at digging into rocks, enabling it to scale vertical walls and even travel upside-down on cave ceilings. It is said that Heatran can only be controlled by a being wielding its Magma Stone, a rock with a molten core found within the very volcano in which this Pokémon resides. Removing the stone from its proper place, however, would cause Heatran to go berserk and cause its volcano to erupt. It is said to be able to trap foes who anger it or threaten its volcano in maelstroms of lava by using Magma Storm.","​Pokémon and all associated names and characters are trademarked and © 1995-2019 Nintendo. All non-original images are provided by Bulbapedia, © 1995-2019 Nintendo.No copyright infringement intended.","Fire/Steel"," 5'07\" | 1.7 m"," 948.0 lbs | 430.0 kg"," Flash Fire | Flame Body"," Undiscovered","Overview","Overview","

The three beings were entirely subservient to Regigigas and would obey its commands above all else. Along with its servants, Regigigas stopped a volcanic eruption in the area now known as Snowpoint City, Sinnoh. After that, it began a centuries-long slumber deep within Snowpoint Temple, sending its servants to a distant region (Hoenn). It is said that anyone seeking to awaken this Pokémon would need to bring its three guardians to it first. Regigigas is believed to be tremendously durable, capable of traveling through practically any terrain and withstanding temperatures both as low as -328°F (-200°C) and as high as 2,400°F (1,300°C).

This dimension is referred to as the Distortion (or Reverse, in some texts) World. Giratina is said to take a different, freer form in this dimension, known as its Origin Forme. The stronger gravity of our world is thought to place confines on Giratina, forcing it to transform into a more restricted form known as its Altered Forme; an artifact known as the Griseous Orb is said to allow it to retain its Origin Forme in this world. Giratina appears to have a connection with death, often seen in visions by people visiting cemeteries. It also is believed to be able to use reflective objects as portals between dimensions. Though rarely mentioned in legends, the few myths that do refer to it describe it as spending eternity gazing enviously into this world and its inhabitants.","Origin Forme","Ghost/Dragon"," 14'09\" | 4.5 m"," 1653.5 lbs | 750.0 kg"," Pressure | Telepathy (Altered Forme) || Levitate (Origin Forme)"," Undiscovered","Overview","Overview","

As it floats, the crescents on its body release a shimmering, star-like powder that trails behind it like a glittering veil. These particles reflect the light of the moon most strikingly, particularly that of the crescent moon. Cresselia is often seen as a counterpart—a rival, even—to Darkrai; while Darkrai has the ability to cause nightmares and embodies the new moon, Cresselia is able to dispel bad dreams and replace them with happier ones, and also symbolizes the crescent moon. In fact, holding one of this Pokémon’s feathers while dozing off is said to guarantee a blissful sleep filled with sweet dreams. Shed Cresselia feathers, also known as Lunar Wings, are thought to be the only way to wake up those put to sleep by Darkrai, save for the appearance of Cresselia itself.","​Also see Darkrai","Psychic"," 4'11\" | 1.5 m"," 188.7 lbs | 85.6 kg"," Levitate"," Undiscovered","Overview","Overview","

The bulbs on their heads are flotation sacs that keep them from sinking; they can deflate them when they wish to dive below. In warmer weather, groups of Phione may be found drifting together on the same currents. Despite exerting very little control while traveling, they have uncanny senses of direction that ensure they will always know how to find their way back home; indeed, during mating season, they will return to the places they were born to mate and lay their eggs. Whether or not Phione should be considered legendaries is a topic of dispute, even among top researchers. On one hand, they are related to the legendary Pokémon Manaphy and are generally considered legendaries among Sinnoh residents, the region where they are the most popular. On the other, they are not particularly rare or strong like other legendaries and can breed to produce other Phione; no other legendary can do so.","Also see Manaphy","Research Notes","Water"," 1'04\" | 0.4 m"," 6.8 lbs | 3.1 kg"," Hydration"," Water 1 | Fairy"," Water 1 | Fairy","

Polluted water can make it very ill, so it only swims in clean, remote areas. Manaphy has the unique ability to bond with any living being, enabling it to understand the emotions of those around it with ease. By using Heart Swap, it can also switch the minds of any two individuals. Manaphy is said to seek out feuding companions and use its powers to swap their minds. It seeks to solve conflicts by forcing opponents to see issues from their foes’ perspectives. Like Phione, Manaphy remembers its birthplace and will return to it to give birth (consequently, all Phione will migrate to the same spot as well). Manaphy is also uniqeuly the only known legendary that is able to breed; the eggs it produces hatch into Phione, though, rather than other Manaphy, so most still consider it a legendary Pokémon.","​Also see Phione","Water"," 1'00\" | 0.3 m"," 6.8 lbs | 1.4 kg"," Hydration"," Water 1 | Fairy","Overview","Overview","

Those put to sleep by Darkrai are said to experience endless torment through their worst fears; seeing a mysterious, shadowy figure is a common theme among victims—many believe this figure to be Darkrai itself. Darkrai appears to be attracted to nightmares, and may in fact feed off of them. It has the ability to turn into a shadow and travel silently through the night. Its body is intangible and changeable; many sightings of this Pokémon describe long, spindly legs extending from its body. The light of the moon is said to scare this Pokémon away. Lunar Wings are thought to be the only way to wake Darkrai’s victims. Some believe that Darkrai only causes nightmares as a defense mechanism, and that it is not truly evil.

Shaymin is able to neutralize toxins in the air and cause barren wastelands to turn into lush gardens overnight. In Sinnoh mythology, the settlement of Floaroma Town was once barren and inhospitable. One day, a young man who lived in the area expressed his gratitude for simply being alive despite the bleakness around him. Suddenly, the land bloomed into a field of beautiful flowers, turning Floaroma Town into what it is today. Shaymin has an affinity for beautiful Gracidea Flowers; the blooms’ pollen can turn Shaymin into its Sky Forme and grant it with the power of flight.

Legend has it that a selfish trainer once attempted to trap Victini on the secluded Liberty Island near ​Unova in hopes of guaranteeing his own perpetual success. The trainer, however, never won a battle for the rest of his life, because a victory must be earned to be true. Some believe Victini still returns to Liberty Island to this day.

Snivy will always keep their heads held up high. They are known to refuse orders they consider “unbecoming” or “unworthy;” in fact, Snivy may even persuade other Pokémon to complete tasks they do not want to finish for them. Despite their haughty personalities, however, Snivy are also very calm and intelligent. Though they dislike combat, they will stay collected when attacked and always think before acting. Though their arms are usable, Snivy are more adept at using vines to handle objects. The leaves on their tails photosynthesize energy, making Snivy faster in bright sunlight.

Servine consider themselves “above” eating like most Pokémon do; as a result, even trained ones may refuse food in favor of basking in sunlight to photosynthesize. Though they can stand bipedally, Servine usually move around by slithering on their bellies. They defend themselves from foes with surprising agility, slithering swiftly between the legs of enemies to disorient them before lashing out with their vines.

Serperior consider most opponents unworthy of their time, and as a result will often ignore or only halfheartedly retaliate against weaker foes. When confronted with opponents that prove to be their equals, however, they will let their true power show. Their glares are said to freeze weaker foes dead in their tracks. Though both their arms and legs have withered away from lack of ​use, Serperior are still very swift Pokémon. They use their entire bodies to photosynthesize and create energy for their attacks, amplifying this energy internally when faced with stronger foes. In battle, they can confound foes with moves like Leaf Tornado should they feel they are worth the effort.

When they find some, they roast them with fire before consuming them. Tepig can be deceptively nimble when necessary, capable of leaping away of incoming attacks. They shoot fireballs out of their nostrils to deter foes. When ill, however, they will begin spewing black smoke instead. Though initially shy, Tepig are quick to warm up to new things and are very easily excited (foreshadowing the personalities of Pignite and Emboar). They have been known to burn Berries by snorting too much fire when roasting them due to enthusiasm.

Their movements also become sharper and more agile as their flames intensify. Pignite are also skilled fighters, particularly when it comes to wrestling. They are close-range brawlers; though capable of shooting flames from a distance, they prefer to attack foes using their limbs or even their whole bodies. When Pignite begin to feel hungry, their internal fires will weaken from lack of fuel. Consequently, they will become sluggish and their attacks will weaken. Letting a Pignite’s fire completely die out is extremely dangerous for the Pokémon, possibly even fatal. Because of this, Pignite trainers are advised to always carry around fat-rich snacks in case their Pokémon begin to feel famished.","﻿Evolves from Tepig at Lvl 17Evolves into Emboar at Lvl 36","Research Notes","Fire/Fighting"," 3'03\" | 1.0 m"," 122.4 lbs | 55.5 kg"," Blaze |","Thick Fat","Thick Fat","

Oshawott fight primarily using the shells on their bellies, often called “scalchops.” These implements can be detached at will, and can be reattached in a much like suction cups. Oshawott are born with scalchops attached; simple shells found on beaches will not suffice as substitutes. Scalchops consist primarily of a combination of chitin and calcium carbonate—their composition is nearly identical to that of an Oshawott’s claws (which are normally retracted). Scalchops are as sharp as blades; they are used to slash at foes and keep them at bay. Oshawott also use scalchops to slice open hard Berries when eating and thick vines when traveling. Because they rely on their scalchops so heavily, Oshawott will guard them with their lives.

They can use Razor Shell in battle to a similar effect. Their skilled fighting techniques have garnered them much respect ​in their coastal habitats; a single glare or roar from a Samurott is often enough to scare off enemies.

"504","Patrat","504","Prairies, fields, savannas, deserts","Patrat live in large groups known as “mobs” (or, in some areas, “manors”). They dig complex networks of underground tunnels with many openings to the surface, allowing them to covertly travel nearly anywhere without being exposed to aboveground predators. Each opening of these network will always have a Patrat standing on guard, no matter what time it is. Guard Patrat are intensely alert, sometimes not blinking for minutes. In their attentiveness, however, most Patrat tend to ignore looking behind themselves, and thus are vulnerable to attacks from the rear. Their great peripheral vision makes them quick to notice foes coming from the sides, however. Patrat will become anxious when even a single hole is left unguarded, and will refuse to leave their tunnels until an “all-clear” signal is given by every one of the guards. They wave their tails to communicate with others. They are able to store food in their cheek pouches to bring back to their nests; members of a mob will store their food communally in one large pile.","﻿Evolves into Watchog at Lvl 20","Research Notes","Normal"," 1'08\" | 0.5 m"," 25.6 lbs | 11.6 kg"," Run Away | Keen Eye |","Analytic","Analytic","

These Pokémon can go for days without sleep and can remain standing completely still for similar periods of time.  Watchog are constantly on the lookout for danger. Members of a clan will arrange themselves so that they can see approaching foes from every angle. When Watchog spot trouble, their tails will stand straight on end and the fluorescent bands on their body along with their eyes will glow, both alerting their allies and unnerving approaching enemies; the initial flash of light has been known to temporarily blind attackers. Their friends will scramble back into their tunnels and shovel as many seeds as they can in their cheek pouches (like Patrat, Watchog keep their food in a communal pile underground), surfacing back up to shoot kernels at the foes.

Lillipup use their long facial hairs to detect subtle changes in air currents and help them detect approaching foes. These Pokémon will fearlessly stand their ground when confronted. However, they quickly assess situations to determine risk and are smart enough to back down from foes that are too strong. Lillipup are very loyal and are quick to defend their trainers and allies. Though their senses of smell are above average, they rely moreso on their fur to learn about their environments. In wet weather, their fur becomes matted and begins to clump, severely hindering their abilities to analyze their surroundings. It is important to keep Lillipup dry in order to avoid this; such a task may be difficult, however, as they also enjoy swimming and jumping into puddles. Trainers with Lillipup are advised to carry around towels to keep their Pokémon dry. Lillipup do not bark, making them well suited to trainers living in small apartments.","﻿Evolves into Herdier at Lvl 16Herdier evolves into Stoutland at Lvl 32","Research Notes","Normal"," 1'04\" | 0.4 m"," 9.0 lbs | 4.1 kg"," Vital Spirit | Pickup |","Run Away","Run Away","

In the past, Herdier aided hunters in pursuing prey, cutting off fleeing game and helping drag carcasses back to villages. They are extremely loyal Pokémon, perhaps even to a fault; Herdier will always obey their trainers’ commands, even if doing so would put them in danger. They are very wary of strangers, however. Today, Herdier remain common sights in both rural and urban areas.On farms, they help herd and defend livestock, while in cities, they are often kept as pets and hailed for their loyalty. Herdier are believed to have even helped people raise other Pokémon in older times, leading many to believe that the practice of raising Herdier was a precursor to modern-day Pokémon training. Recently, cave paintings depicting Herdier and humans working together have been discovered in Unova. The dark cape-like fur on their backs is tough and hard; Herdier will shelter smaller Pokémon under these capes to protect them from harm. This fur gets both longer and harder as Herdier grow older.","﻿Evolves from Lillipup at Lvl 16Evolves into Stoutland at Lvl 32","Research Notes","Normal"," 2'11\" | 0.9 m"," 32.4 lbs | 14.7 kg"," Intimidate | Sand Rush |","Scrappy","Scrappy","

In particular, they are often associated with mountain villages, where they are most often found (Stoutland evolving from Herdier are also seen in urban areas, though their thick coats generally mean that they can only thrive in cooler climates). In past decades, travelers to remote mountain villages had reported that every household kept a Stoutland of their own. Their shaggy fur is excellent at retaining heat, allowing them to travel across snow and ice with ease; they are also adapted to cross rugged, rocky terrain. They are very wise and compassionate; in fact, Stoutland are often employed as hiking guides for mountain travelers thanks to their resistance to the cold and affinity for people. They are also known to lead rescue missions during blizzards to find stranded hikers. When they find lost travelers, they will wrap their long fur around them keep them warm. Their fur is so efficient at retaining heat that it is said a person stranded overnight in the snow during the dead of winter would be perfectly fine as long as he or she was wrapped tightly in it. Some parents even trust these gentle Pokémon to watch over their children.","﻿Lillipup evolves into Herdier at Lvl 16Evolves from Herdier at Lvl 32","Research Notes","Normal"," 3'11\" | 1.2 m"," 134.5 lbs | 61.0 kg"," Intimidate | Sand Rush |","Scrappy","Scrappy","

When compassionate passersby stoop down to help, they will quickly steal their jewelry, wallets, or other valuable items before dashing away. Even when caught, Purrloin have the inexplicable ability to put on ruses of cuteness and cause victims to forgive them without trouble. Many believe Purrloin only steal for fun; unlike Pokémon like Meowth or Murkrow, Purrloin do not hoard what they thieve, and instead toss them away once sufficiently far from their owners. Though they normally stand on four legs, they are also facultative bipeds, much to the surprise of many of their foes. When threatened, Purrloin will act cutely in hopes of tricking their opponent into letting their guards down. Then, they will unsheathe their sharp claws and attack viciously with quick, successive slashes. Despite their negative reputation, however, many people still find Purrloin adorable, making them common pets in many cities.

They are known for their beautiful fur, graceful movements, and stealthy hunting. They will always approach prey from behind; their paws are padded with special fur that silences their footsteps. Once Liepard draw close enough, they will use their powerful hind legs to pounce on victims, who often never even see them coming. These Pokémon are nocturnal and have keen eyesight even in the dark to help them see small prey. The spots on their bodies break up their outlines in shady patches of grass, further disguising them. Liepard are adept at climbing trees, spending most of their days resting lazily on branches. Because their fur is so prized for its beauty, it fetches a high price on the black market, where it is sold for use in the fashion industry. Liepard hunting has been outlawed in much of the world, though poaching still remains rampant. How this will affect the species’s numbers remains to be seen. In the wild, Liepard compete with Thievul for territory.","﻿Evolves from Purrloin at Lvl 20","Research Notes","Dark"," 3'07\" | 1.1 m"," 82.7 lbs | 37.5 kg"," Limber | Unburden |","Prankster","Prankster","

They are friendly Pokémon that often approach strangers; many of them sometimes congregate around travelers. They spend much of their time up in the treetops, though they will wander around the forest floor in search of their favorite food--Berries. Pansage are skilled in locating Berries and are very knowledgeable about their various effects. They are known to share Berries with injured Pokémon and humans, curing ailments like poisoning, paralysis, and burns with the different Berries they have foraged. they will also lead hungry travelers to Berry bushes and thickets where they can find food. The leaves in the small tufts on their heads contain a potent combination of various aromatic compounds that is highly effective at relieving stress and weariness. Pansage may offer one of their leaves to tired travelers after showing them Berry bushes, revitalizing them and allowing them to continue their journeys with renewed vigor.","﻿Evolves into Simisage with a Leaf StoneAlso see Pansear and ​Panpour","Research Notes","Grass"," 2'00\" | 0.6 m"," 23.1 lbs | 10.5 kg"," Gluttony |","Overgrow","Overgrow","

They fearlessly approach those who enter their territories. Though they often harass trespassers by throwing Berries or screeching loudly, they will not attack unless enraged. However, they are erratic and can be set off by seemingly nothing at all; conversely, some travelers have reported that trying to attack Simisage only resulted in the Pokémon becoming amiable and offering food and gifts. They are also prone to sudden mood swings, being cheerful and enthusiastic at one moment and then irate and aggressive the next. Simisage attack by swinging their thorny tails at opponents like clubs. They are also capable of using moves like Seed Bomb. The leaves on their heads are very bitter, but they also contain tremendous amounts of caffeine. People have used these leaves in traditional energy drinks for centuries, steeping them in hot water to extract the caffeine. The bitterness is said to be an acquired taste, however.","﻿Evolves from Pansage with a Leaf StoneAlso see Simisear and Simipour","Research Notes","Grass"," 3'07\" | 1.1 m"," 67.2 lb | 30.5 kg"," Gluttony |","Overgrow","Overgrow","

Unlike some other volcano-dwelling Fire-type Pokémon, however, Pansear do not only restrict themselves to active or dormant volcanoes; they can also be found on or near the calderas of extinct ones as well, despite their lack of magma. This ability makes extinct volcanoes “hot spots,” so to speak, for Pansear colonies; as other species of Pokémon emigrate to new volcanoes once their current ones die out, Pansear in these areas can take over the abandoned territories and repopulate them. Pansear internally combust their food (mostly Berries) to provide themselves with energy. They are highly intelligent, capable of solving logic puzzles as fast as an average child. They mainly store heat in the tufts of fur on their heads, which can reach temperatures of up to 600°F (300°C). They often cook gathered Berries before consuming them, and are known to skewer them on twigs and roast them over their heads as they search for more food.","﻿Evolves into Simisear with a Leaf StoneAlso see Pansage and Panpour","Research Notes","Fire"," 2'00\" | 0.6 m"," 24.3 lbs | 11.0 kg"," Gluttony |","Blaze","Blaze","

They will often approach foreigners entering their territories, holding out handfuls of Berries as peace offerings. Simisear are heavily reliant on sugar to fuel their internal flames; without it, they will become dull and unresponsive. As a result, they tend to consume only the sweetest types of Berries, such as Pecha and Mago Berries. Though generally rare where they live, Simisear are particularly fond of Custap Berries, due to their overwhelming sweetness. In artificial settings, Simisear have been shown to be intelligent enough to grow and harvest their own Berries if provided with the necessary tools and instructions. However, they appear to only be willing to farm their own food if no other options are available; they will let their crops wither as soon as a more available food source appears. Simisear are also fond of candy because of the high sugar content of such treats.  When threatened, Simisear can shake their heads and tails to release clouds of fiery embers that shroud and burn foes.","﻿Evolves from Pansear with a Fire StoneAlso see Simisage and Simipour","Research Notes","Fire"," 3'03\" | 1.0 m"," 61.7 lbs | 28.0 kg"," Gluttony |","Blaze","Blaze","

Despite being adept swimmers, they spend most of their time on land foraging for Berries. Panpour can store water in the tufts of fur on their heads, allowing them to travel long distances while staying hydrated.  Flexible, hose-like structures run down their backs and through their tails, enabling them to shoot water out of their tails at varying pressures to defend themselves from enemies. In addition to storing water, these tufts also infuse the water they store with nutrients and minerals Panpour obtain from their food. This makes Panpour water very nutritious, particularly for plants. Though Panpour cannot plant their own sources of food (as they seem unable to make the connection between seeds and plants), they are smart enough to learn how to water plants in order to encourage their growth. Plants watered by Panpour grow exceptionally large thanks to the fortified water Panpour spray. In hot weather, Panpour may spray themselves in order to cool down.","﻿Evolves into Simipour with a Water StoneAlso see Pansage and Pansear","Research Notes","Water"," 2'00\" | 0.6 m"," 29.8 lbs | 13.5 kg"," Gluttony |","Torrent","Torrent","

Simipour are very mellow Pokémon that rarely become aggressive towards others. They are often found dwelling near clean, freshwater lakes where they can easily refill their tufts. Like Panpour, Simipour are known to water nearby plants (particularly their food sources, Berry trees) in order to foster their growth. Simipour are very closely related to the similar Simisage and Simisear, sharing physical characteristics as well as Berry-exclusive diets. It is thought that the three species evolved from a single, recent common ancestor that adapted to various different habitats; acrobatic Simisage can harvest Berries growing at high altitudes, hardy Simisear can dwell in extinct volcanic areas even after most other Pokémon have left, and semiaquatic Simipour can support their own food sources near most bodies of fresh water.","﻿Evolves from Panpour with a Water StoneAlso see Simisage and Simisear","Research Notes","Water"," 3'03\" | 1.0 m"," 63.9 lbs | 29.0 kg"," Gluttony |"," Field"," Field","

They rest in abandoned buildings during the day, cloaking themselves in soporific Dream Mist as protection. At night, they wander about houses in search of sleeping individuals, siphoning their dreams into the holes on their snouts. Their floral patterns light up as they feed. This process is entirely harmless, though these individuals will wake up unable to remember exactly what they dreamt of. Once Munna consume what they can of the dreams, they then process the remaining substance into Dream Mist, a sleep-inducing fog that they use to protect themselves from predators. If the dreams they consumed were pleasant, then the Dream Mist will be bright pink in color and dissipate fairly quickly once released. Munna that siphon nightmares, however, will expel thick, grayish-purple or black mist and will likely become ill. Munna will aid those suffering from bad dreams by shrouding them in Dream Mist; inhalation of the mist will replace bad dreams with whatever dreams the Munna had consumed before. ","﻿Evolves into Musharna with a Moon Stone","Research Notes","Psychic"," 2'00\" | 0.6 m"," 51.3 lbs | 23.3 kg"," Forewarn | Synchronize |","Telepathy","Telepathy","

Like Munna, Musharna consume the dreams of people and Pokemon through the holes on their forehead. However, their Dream Mist is far more powerful and concentrated than that of Munna. Gazing closely at their Dream Mist will reveal fragments of the dreams the Musharna had consumed. Depending on the dreams eaten, their mists can take a variety colors, though pink is the most common. Dark, sooty Dream Mist is said to be especially dangerous. When threatened, Musharna can manipulate their Dream Mist to create physical manifestations of the objects, people, and Pokemon within the dreams they had eaten. The figures created are often indistinguishable from real ones. Because of this, Musharna Dream Mist is very valuable on the black market. The illicit capture of Musharna to exploit their mist has become a problem recently, so the species is now protected in most regions. ","﻿Evolves from Munna with a Moon Stone","Research Notes","Psychic"," 3'07\" | 1.1 m"," 133.4 lbs | 60.5 kg"," Forewarn | Synchronize |","Telepathy","Telepathy","

In many areas, they have even become accustomed to being fed breadcrumbs by passerby. Though very loyal and compliant to their trainers, Pidove are not very intelligent. They will always obey commands, but have trouble remembering exactly what they were told to do for more than a few minutes. Pidove has been known to fly off to fetch items only to return less than a minute later empty-handed, having forgotten what they were searching for. In spite of their forgetfulness, Pidove have the uncanny ability to always find their way back to their nests, no matter how far or long they have flown. It is believed that these Pokémon can retain visual details far better than aural information, allowing them to navigate home unerringly despite not being able to remember spoken commands for extended periods of time.","﻿Evolves into Tranquill at Lvl 21​Tranquill evolves into Unfezant at Lvl 32","Research Notes","Normal/Flying"," 1'00\" | 0.3 m"," 4.6 lbs | 2.1 kg"," Big Pecks | Super Luck |","Rivalry","Rivalry","

While their pre-evolutions are known for their noisy coos, Tranquill rarely make much sound at all, except for a peculiar cross between a coo and a cluck during mating season. Even when trained, Tranquill prefer solitude over company. If given the chance, they will spend most of their time alone in quiet places. However, they are fiercely loyal to their trainers; they are always able to find their way back to them even if they have travelled considerably far since the last time they were together. Their uncanny senses of direction make them a popular partner for delivery workers. Tranquill are better at walking than most other avian Pokémon, and are capable of sprinting across flat terrain for short distances.

While female Unfezant are drably colored in black, gray, and brown, males are adorned with bright pink “masks” and vivid green splotches on their undersides. During mating season, females tend to choose mates with the brightest-colored masks and the longest tassels; consequently male Unfezant will fight viciously to become the most “desirable”, tearing off parts of their opponents’ tassels or sullying their masks with dirt and debris. Male Unfezant will also swing their heads wildly in order to both threaten opponents and attract mates, as the action makes their tassels appear longer. These adornments are cumbersome for flight, so females tend to be better long-distance fliers than males. Stronger wings allow males to fly faster over short distances, however. Both genders are equally adept at running, perhaps even more so than flying. Like Pidove and Tranquill, Unfezant are fiercely loyal to their trainers, refusing to become close with anyone (including potential mates, unless explicitly given permission) other than them. Female Unfezant tend to take longer to warm up to strangers, while males are more outgoing from the start.

"522","Blitzle","522","Plains, savannas","Blitzle can be found in small herds of roughly two dozen members on dry plains and savannas. They are especially common during thunderstorms, when large numbers of them congregate out in the open to absorb discharged electricity. The tips of the manes on their heads act as lightning rods, directing lightning to themselves and storing it for later use. Blitzle flash their manes with varying frequencies, rhythms, and intensities to communicate with others. When threatened, they can discharge large amounts of electricity at once in bright flashes of light, giving them time to dash away while foes are blinded. Blitzle have no way of generating their own electricity, however, so they rely largely on the weather to charge up. Because of this, Blitzle rarely use their electricity for anything other than communication unless the situation is absolutely dire. Scientists believe that their black bodies and white stripes help them avoid predators—when many Blitzle stand in a group, it becomes difficult to distinguish one from another due to their blending patterns.","﻿Evolves into Zebstrika at Lvl 27","Research Notes","Electric"," 2'07\" | 0.8 m"," 65.7 lbs | 25.9 kg"," Lightning Rod | Motor Drive |","Sap Sipper","Sap Sipper","

Zebstrika are easily angered and will charge at full gallop at anything they perceive as threats. Once a single Zebstrika in a herd charges, the rest of the herd charges as well, leading to a stampede within a matter of seconds. As Zebstrika run, their manes begin discharging bolts of electricity in all directions, stunning everything nearby. The sound of a Zebstrika galloping at full speed is akin to a thunder clap, while a herd of them makes the ground reverberate as if a tremendous storm is approaching. Zebstrika, like their pre-evolutions, communicate by flashing their manes in a variety of patterns, though their stripes can now light up and flash as well.

"524","Roggenrola","524","Mountains, subterranean caves","Roggenrola were discovered relatively recently when an earthquake fissure revealed a cave where many of them were congregated. They require immense pressure in order to develop properly, so they are almost exclusively found deep within the earth. The crushing pressure of the underground allows them to develop dense bodies as hard as steel, with mysterious “energy cores” that—obviously—seem to provide them with energy. Their bodies are made up of compressed sediment dated to be hundreds of years old. Occasionally, older Roggenrola may make their way to deep caves closer to the surface, perhaps out of curiosity. They must return back into the earth, though, as their cores require pressure to run. The holes on their bodies are not eyes, but actually ears. They allow Roggenrola to hear sounds that reverberate in the rocks around them, alerting them to potential dangers like running water, which can cool their cores and erode their bodies; a long soak can even leave them soft and vulnerable for weeks. They follow sounds intently, toppling over from surprise if they stop abruptly. These ears also connect to and vent their energy cores, and these Pokémon will get quite angry if these orifices are messed with. Roggenrola seem to enjoy comparing body hardness with Pokémon like Carbink.","﻿Evolves into Boldore at Lvl 25Boldore evolves into Gigalith through trade","Research Notes","Rock"," 1'04\" | 0.4 m"," 39.7 lbs | 18.0 kg"," Sturdy |","Sand Force","Sand Force","

Boldore still spend most of their time deep below, but they can now spend extended periods of time in caves near the surface thanks to improved core stability. The orange crystals jutting from their bodies are in fact hardened growths of their cores, which sometimes leak from cracks in their forms when they store too much energy. These outgrowths are signs of healthy Boldore, as they signal a surplus of energy. A single crystal holds enough energy to fuel 100 trucks; for this reason, they are quite valuable in the energy industry. These orange growths are also harder than diamond. Boldore cannot turn, so they scuttle back and forth or left and right. They use their ears to detect echoes and vibrations around them. Unlike Roggenrola, Boldore use their ears to find rather than avoid water; since their radioactive cores are now much stronger, they are also more prone to overheating. For this reason, Boldore must occasionally drink water cool themselves down to prevent potential meltdowns, though they still dislike getting their exteriors wet. Though Boldore are not yet specifically protected by any official legislation, increased pressure on Boldore populations due to their energy-rich crystals has led to many conservation efforts arising in multiple regions. These Pokémon are easily spooked and will charge straight forwards towards unfamiliar sounds. ​When a Boldore's crystals begin to glow, it is preparing to launch an energy attack.","﻿Evolves from Roggenrola at Lvl 25Evolves into Gigalith through trade","Research Notes","Rock"," 2'11\" | 0.9 m"," 224.9 lbs | 102.0 kg"," Sturdy | Weak Armor |","Sand Force","Sand Force","

Though they spend most of their time deep underground, Gigalith will make their way to the surface to bask in the sun’s rays. The crystals on their bodies can convert sunlight into energy in their radioactive cores, allowing them to effectively survive off of nothing but the sun. Studies of how they store, release, and convert light energy have given way to commodities such as phosphorescent paint and clothing. Gigalith can also fire stored light from their mouths in devastating balls of energy capable of leveling mountains. They are often used in construction to demolish buildings. If they do not sunbathe for too long, however, they become unable to attack. Despite their destructive potential, Gigalith are peaceful Pokémon, as their nigh-indestructible bodies keep them safe without the need to retaliate. Additionally, when Gigalith fire off particularly powerful attacks, they in fact crack their bodies with thousands of tiny fissures from the recoil, and must hide themselves away until they recover. Scientists are currently researching their radioactive cores, particularly on how they can retain such power will little, if any, ill effects.

Woobat roost by attaching their noses to the walls of caves, using their nostrils as suction cups. When they fly away, they leave behind distinctive heart-shaped marks on walls. Some people believe that having a Woobat land on one’s body and leave a mark on the skin is a sign of good fortune, especially for one’s romantic life. Woobat are friendly Pokémon, and curious ones as well. Many of them can be seen flitting around spelunkers that enter their caverns, probing the travelers with their sound waves and noses.

Releasing such strong sound pulses tires them out quickly, however, rendering them temporarily unable to fly. By shaking their tails vigorously, they can further increase the power of their waves. Despite their destructive potential, however, Swoobat rarely ever need to resort to using such attacks. They are very friendly Pokémon that are almost always found in pairs. Recently, researchers have discovered that the ultrasonic waves emitted by idle male Swoobat while courting (which they are almost always in the process of doing) have a positive effect on the moods of both people and Pokémon. In battle, Swoobat are known to use their innocent demeanors to their advantages, using their suction cup-like noses to attack foes with Heart Stamp while their guards are lowered.","﻿Evolves from Woobat with high happiness","Research Notes","Psychic/Flying"," 2'11\" | 0.9 m"," 23.1 lbs | 10.5 kg"," Unaware | Klutz |","Simple","Simple","

They spend most of their time in underground caves and tunnels, primarily surfacing to supplement their diets with fruits and plant matter (they usually consume insects and other small invertebrates found in the dirt). Despite being mostly solitary, Drilbur tend to be very friendly towards other Pokémon and humans. They sometimes develop mutualistic relationships with people in suburban and rural areas, plowing backyard gardens and orchards in exchange for fruits and Berries. However, unruly Drilbur can easily damage entire fields of crops by tearing carelessly through plant roots, so trained individuals are heavily preferred for agricultural purposes. Drilbur burrow by clasping their claws together over their heads and rotating about at high speeds like drills. They can spin as fast as 30 mph (50 km/h) in this manner, nearly as speedy as an average car on a city road. Drilbur build their nests underground, constructing many tunnels passing through them for travel and ventilation. They leaves distinctive mounds of dirt on the surface directly above their nests to help them find their way back home.","﻿Evolves into Excadrill at Lvl 31","Research Notes","Ground"," 1'00\" | 0.3 m"," 18.7 lbs | 8.5 kg"," Sand Rush | Sand Force |","Mold Breaker","Mold Breaker","

Individuals have been found living more than 300 feet (91 meters) below the earth’s surface. By straightening out their bodies and clasping their claws and blades together in cone-like shapes, they can spin around rapidly to dig through the earth like drills at speeds reaching 90 mph (145 km/h); their burrowing is powerful enough to cut through iron plates. Excadrill intentionally construct maze-like tunnel networks that only they can navigate. Prey that stumble into their tunnels become lost in the labyrinths, allowing Excadrill to easily capture and drag them back to their nest in the hearts of these mazes. The burrowing of these Pokémon is beneficial for crop growth, as they till soil far more efficiently than most human processes.

By touching the feelers on their ears to objects, these Pokémon can pick up even the smallest sound waves; because of this, Audino are common sights in hospitals and Pokémon Centers, where they are trained to use their feelers as stethoscopes to detect irregularities in the heartbeats of patients. Their hearing is so advanced that they can also use their feelers to assess other aspects of an individual’s health, including blood pressure, breathing, and digestion. Some Pokémon breeders and daycare centers also employ Audino to assess Pokémon eggs and determine when they will most likely hatch. Even without using their feelers, their hearing is still superb, being as sensitive as many artificial radars. Audino are rarely seen in the wild, as they are shy Pokémon that retreat and hide when they hear someone approaching—considering their extraordinary aural abilities, this means that they almost always are hiding from potential enemies.","Can Mega Evolve into Mega Audino","Research Notes","Normal"," 3'07\" | 1.1 m"," 68.3 lbs | 31.0 kg"," Healer | Regenerator |","Klutz","Klutz","

In the wild, Timburr are usually found in forests and wooded mountains. They use their strength to break down trees into more manageable planks and logs, which they in turn use to construct temporary shelters. Timburr are constantly looking for ways to improve the strength and stability of their homes. Every morning, they tear down the homes they built the day before to salvage materials for constructing new shelters, experimenting with different techniques and designs. This often leads to the creation of very strange-looking shelters, some of which are stable and some of which are not. It is said that these Pokémon enjoy building so much that they throw tantrums when unexpected rain halts their projects for the day. When Timburr are capable of lifting whole logs three times their size without having to splinter them into smaller pieces, they are close to evolution. Wild Timburr are known to visit human cities to examine the architecture of urban buildings; they will later attempt to imitate the designs they see in their own structures.","﻿Evolves into Gurdurr at Lvl 25Gurdurr evolves into Conkeldurr through trade","Research Notes","Fighting"," 2'00\" | 0.6 m"," 27.6 lbs | 12.5 kg"," Guts | Sheer Force |","Iron Fist","Iron Fist","

Like Timburr, Gurdurr are often seen near construction sites helping workers build; in fact, they seem to prefer working alongside humans to working alone, possibly because of the plentiful resources they gain access to by doing so. These Pokémon are often seen carrying steel beams as signs of strength, though they will carry just about anything heavy to display their power. When not building, Gurdurr will hold their beams over their heads in order to work on their strength and endurance. Their bodies are so sturdy that it is said a group of pro wrestlers pushing on them would not even make them budge. When tearing down buildings, Gurdurr will swing their heavy beams to pulverize them, often rendering the remains unsalvageable in the process. They are generally more suited at destruction rather than construction, though they perform their demolitions with skill and pride. Groups of Gurdurr and Machoke can sometimes be seen comparing their muscles with each other; \"losers\" will drop out of future comparisons in favor of additional training.","﻿Evolves from Timburr at Lvl 25Evolves into Conkeldurr through trade","Research Notes","Fighting"," 3'11\" | 1.2 m"," 88.2 lbs | 40.0 kg"," Guts | Sheer Force |","Iron Fist","Iron Fist","

It is believed that Conkeldurr learned how to make concrete long ago in order to construct stronger structures, and taught the skill to humans about 2,000 years ago. Even today, an average Conkeldurr can mix a stronger concrete from natural materials than modern commercial brands. Their upper bodies are so massive that they have trouble staying upright, relying on their concrete pillars to stand up. Despite this, Conkeldurr are incredibly powerful and sturdy. In addition to their strength, they are also very knowledgeable in the fields of building and architecture. These Pokémon are employed at construction sites not to build, but rather to supervise and assess the stability and integrity of structures. In combat, instead of relying on brute force to overpower opponents, Conkeldurr spin their pillars at high speeds and smash them into opponents; the centrifugal force of the pillars enables them to strike with immense power. Conkeldurr can also swing their pillars about freely to attack, though doing so may occasionally cause them to lose balance. In dire situations, they will throw their pillars aside to pummel their foes with their fists, though they have great difficulty remaining upright while doing so.","﻿Timburr evolves into Gurdurr at Lvl 25Evolves from Gurdurr through trade","Research Notes","Fighting"," 4'07\" | 1.4 m"," 191.8 lbs | 87.0 kg"," Guts | Sheer Force |","Iron Fist","Iron Fist","

"535","Tympole","535","Ponds, wetlands","Tympole live in large groups known as “circles.” The growths on either side of their heads can vibrate quickly in order to produce ultrasonic waves. These waves, though imperceptible to humans, are how Tympole communicate with one another. When threatened, a Tympole will emit a distinctive pattern and frequency of sound that only other Tympole can hear; once the rest of the circle hears the warning, they will all begin to produce the same sound. The circle will then, as a group, adjust the frequency of the sound waves they are emitting until they become audible at an earsplitting pitch to attackers. In battle, this tactic manifests as the move Round. Curiously if a single Tympole is isolated and put under stress, it will emit an initial warning sound as usual, but will not attempt to stun the opponent with a subsequent deafening pitch, instead only holding the first note. This seems to indicate that Tympole will not attack until their warning calls are “confirmed” by allies, which occurs when other Tympole replicate the starting pitch. Resonating ripples on the surface of a pond are a sure sign of a Tympole circle singing below.","﻿Evolves into Palpitoad at Lvl 17Palpitoad evolves into Seismitoad at Lvl 36","Research Notes","Water"," 1'08\" | 0.5 m"," 9.9 lbs | 4.5 kg"," Swift Swim | Hydration |","Water Absorb","Water Absorb","

They cannot stray far from the water’s edge, however, as they must keep their skin moist in order to breathe properly (as they essentially breathes through their thin skin). Because they lack arms, Palpitoad rely primarily on their tails for balance. They use their long, sticky tongues to catch flying insects in midair; their saliva contains a substance that paralyzes prey on contact. By vibrating the bumps around their bodies, they can create small tremors on land or ripples in water; this helps scare out prey for them to catch. In the evening during mating season, groups of Palpitoad are often found perched on rocks near the shore. They can be heard executing complex rhythms as a part of their mating rituals by vibrating their circular growths in various patterns. At the end of these songs, the individuals that created the most beautiful rhythms are the most likely to be chosen as mates. Palpitoad with larger bumps can produce a greater range of pitches, thus giving them an advantage in song composition.

By vibrating the circular growths around their bodies, Seismitoad can create earthquakes while on land and large waves while in the water. Additionally, by vibrating the bumps on their hands, they can deliver powerful punches that send shockwaves through the bodies of foes. Such attacks have the ability to pulverize boulders. Even when idle, Seismitoad generate minute, barely-palpable vibrations beneath them that can cause dizziness and nausea in those nearby. In some regions, trained Seismitoad work as masseuses for the elderly, using their vibrating lumps to work out muscle soreness. The bumps on their heads can also shoot out a paralyzing substance; research shows that the compound is a more potent version of that found Palpitoad’s numbing saliva. Because their bodies are also coated in a thin layer of the same substance, touching a Seismitoad’s skin will also induce a similar effect; people sometimes use this compound in mild doses as a hallucinogen.","﻿Tympole evolves into Palpitoad at Lvl 17Evolves from Palpitoad at Lvl 36","Research Notes","Water/Ground"," 4'07\" | 1.5 m"," 136.7 lbs | 62.0 kg"," Swift Swim | Poison Touch |","Water Absorb","Water Absorb","

Throh can tighten their belts to become sturdier and stronger. As they train, they search for more resilient vines that can withstand their strength; A Throh will gauge another’s power based on the toughness of its belt, which grows darker over time as it absorbs its owner's sweat. Their primary method of defending themselves is to grab hold of threats and throw them as far away as possible. If enemies are too far away to grasp, these Pokémon are also known to chuck heavy objects like logs and boulders at them from a distance to scare them away. In battle, Throh can pull off rare Fighting-type techniques such as Storm Throw in order to overpower foes. They will usually wait for their opponents to try and attack them first before retaliating with defensive counterattacks.

People living near the feet of mountains often report hearing distant thumping sounds in the middle of the night; oftentimes, they are the sounds of Sawk training their chops and kicks on tree trunks and boulders.

When Sewaddle are born, their mother Leavanny tailor their first outfits in order to keep them warm and protected. As Sewaddle grow, they periodically shed their clothing and sews new sets on their own, though their mothers will aid in proportioning and tailoring their outfits. The leafy hoods surrounding their heads make it difficult for predators to detect them. When they sense danger, they will wrap their hoods around themselves to hide from threats. The hoods also serve as emergency food sources for them if they become hungry; many Sewaddle have holes in their hoods for this reason, having nibbled at them while famished.

Unlike some other mid-stage Bug-type Pokémon like Metapod, Cascoon, and Spewpa, Swadloon are restless—they are almost always on the move. As Swadloon travel, they feed on dead leaves beneath them on forest floors. In their natural ecosystems, Swadloon often serve integral roles as decomposers, turning dead plant matter into nutrients that nurture new trees and plants.

This is likely because the feeling of such cloth mimics that of the other Cottonee. If attacked, Cottonee will shoot out puffs of cotton from their bodies. These puffs act as decoys to confuse predators, giving them time escape. In larger quantities, these puffs also irritate the eyes and noses of attackers as well as hinder their movement. The puffs can be harvested and stuffed into pillows, or turned into fabric for clothing. Cottonee can also regrow it quickly, making it an abundant resource in woodland areas. These Pokémon cannot float well in the rain, as their bodies become too heavy to be carried by the wind when waterlogged. Consequently, when groups of Cottonee sense approaching storms, they will all attempt to cluster under large trees—oftentimes all together under the same one—in order to stay dry.

Due to their specific needs regarding soil fertility and plant life, however, the conversion of their natural habitats into farmland has also had devastating effects on their numbers. Many regions now protect the richly-soiled areas that wild Petilil call home in efforts to preserve the rapidly-declining species. The leaves on their heads serve as their sole method of defense; when attacked, Petilil will flee and shed these leaves as decoys for predators to eat instead, as they will grow back within a day. Petilil that shed frequently tend to be plumper. These leaves are exceptionally bitter, so most foes that taste them will learn to avoid attacking them in the future.

Regardless of color, Basculin are particularly hostile Pokémon that will attack anything foreign in their waters, earning them the names \"thugs of the lake.\" Schools of Basculin are almost always made up of individuals of the same form (with a few, rare exceptions), and will viciously attack schools of the other color with their strong jaws. Consequently, most bodies of water where Basculin dwell will have an overwhelming majority of one form, with most individuals of the opposite color having been killed off. They are also generally hostile to other species, albeit not to the same degree as to rival Basculin (and even-more hostile Carvanha). Still, they usually are aggressive enough to drive off all Pokémon other than Corphish and Crawdaunt. Basculin appear to differentiate threats from allies by color; red Basculin will attack anything blue, while blue ones will attack anything red.

At night, however, when temperatures drop drastically, these Pokémon rely on the heat retained in the sand from the daytime to stay warm. Sandile also have dark membranes over their eyes; not only do they protect them from blowing sand, but they also shield their eyes from the intense light of the desert sun, absorbing its ultraviolet rays.

"552","Krokorok","552","Deserts","When Sandile evolve into Krokorok, they seek out groups of five to seven members for aid in hunting and protection. These groups are led by females, who delegate hunting to males. They are nocturnal predators, though they are known to wander about during the day as well if they have not eaten for a while. As reptiles, though, they despise the cold, and will bury deep into the desert sand (where the day's heat is retained) on particularly chilly nights instead of hunting. The black membranes covering their eyes develop a new function upon evolution; not only do they protect them from sandstorms and light (though because they are rarely active in the day this is hardly ever a factor), but they also grant Krokorok with infrared vision. This makes them superb hunters, even in the darkness of desert nights, as they can detect prey by their infrared signatures rather than by sight alone. Using their heat-sensitive eyes to locate unwary victims, packs can easily surround and corner their prey before their targets even notice. They will bury extra food in the sand as an emergency cache in case they fail to hunt down a meal in the future. Because their masks vaguely resemble those of criminals, Krokorok are often portrayed as malicious in popular culture. In reality, though, Krokorok are not particularly sinister Pokémon despite how they are often depicted.","﻿Evolves from Sandile at Lvl 29Evolves into Krookodile at Lvl 40","Ground/Dark"," 3'03\" | 1.0 m"," 73.6 lbs | 33.4 kg"," Intimidate | Moxie |"," "," Field"," Field","

"553","Krookodile","553","Deserts"," Krookodile have specialized black membranes over their eyes that shield them from sun and sand and grant them with infrared vision. In addition to these features, however, these membranes now also allow Krookodile to zoom in and out on objects up to 30 miles (50 km) away as if they was looking through pairs of binoculars, allowing them to see amazingly far into the distance. These Pokémon are known to be very aggressive and territorial; unlike Krokorok, Krookodile are solitary hunters that are active both during the day and at night. They can swim through sand as if it was water and sneak up on their victims. Then, they jump out and crunch their prey with their powerful jaws, which are strong enough to crush automobiles. Krookodile have a instinctively bite down on anything moving in front of them, no matter what size or shape. Once they chomp down on something, they will not let go until their victim appears unconscious; they will twist their heads violently to tear prey in half. Because of this, the best course of action when confronted by a Krookodile is to remain totally still, as these Pokémon tend to ignore things that are not in motion. It has recently been discovered that some Krookodile will in fact pair up with a lone Flygon when hunting; the Flygon will create a sandstorm to provide the Krookodile with cover, allowing the Krookodile ambushes the prey more effectively. The two then split the catch evenly.","Sandile evolves into Krokorok at Lvl 29Evolves from Krokorok at Lvl 40","Research Notes","Ground/Dark"," 4'11\" | 1.5 m"," 212.3 lbs | 96.3 kg"," Intimidate | Moxie |","Anger Point","Anger Point","

When Darumaka sleep, their internal fires cool down (relatively, as they still can reach temperatures of 1,100°F, or 600°C) and they withdraw their limbs into their bodies, rocking back and forth slightly in this state. They sleep in upright positions, with the majority of their masses located near their bottoms. This makes them nearly impossible to knock over, no matter how hard they are pushed or pulled. Oddly, sleeping Darumaka were once found congregating near the ruins of an ancient desert civilization, having been asleep for an unknown amount of time. Upon awakening, the creatures appeared dazed for a while, but were otherwise completely healthy. Because of their high internal body temperatures, their droppings are very hot. Nomads used to hold Darumaka dung in their pockets to keep warm during cold desert nights.

In this form, known as Zen Mode, Darmanitan become far more bulky and durable, though they are also rendered completely immobile as a result. Zen Mode Darmanitan are adept at meditation; they don’t need to eat or drink. However, their physical attacks are far weaker than when in Standard Mode; leading them to rely on their durability and mental strength to defeat foes. Many Zen Mode Darmanitan have been found buried in ancient desert ruins, dated to be as old as the structures themselves.

They can survive on remarkably little water for Grass-type Pokémon, letting them to tolerate the aridity of barren deserts. Though they are capable of moving, Maractus remain rooted in place for the majority of the day in order to conserve as much energy as possible. They are a diurnal species that cease all movement once the sun sets. The spikes growing out of their bodies help deter predators from attacking them; however, their large size makes it easy for smaller, more agile creatures (like young avian Pokémon) to avoid their thorns and feast on their seeds. To deter this, Maractus rhythmically shake their partly-hollow bodies to rattle about the dry seeds stored within. This creates maraca-like sounds that startle such Pokémon away. The upbeat, rhythmic sounds of groups of Maractus “dancing” is thought to have heavily influenced the music of native desert cultures. When it rains, Maractus will gorge themselves on water to last until the next distant rainfall. Once a year, Maractus will all scatter their seeds at once, serving as a vital (if fleeting) food source in barren deserts.","​Pokémon and all associated names and characters are trademarked and © 1995-2019 Nintendo. All non-original images are provided by Bulbapedia, © 1995-2019 Nintendo.No copyright infringement intended.","Research Notes","Grass"," 3'03\" | 1.0 m"," 61.7 lbs | 28.0 kg"," Water Absorb | Chlorophyll |","Storm Drain","Storm Drain","

"557","Dwebble","557","Caves, deserts","When first born, Dwebble have no shells on their thin and fragile bodies. Their first instinct is to scramble about in search of adequate rocks, which they meticulously inspect for imperfections and weaknesses. When Dwebble find ideal stones, they will secrete a highly corrosive acid from their mouths onto the rocks, dissolving holes large enough for their bodies to fit into; they often make enemies of Geodude, Roggenrola, and Rolycoly by trying to dissolve them by mistake. Dwebble rely on their rocky shells for protection from predators, tucking themselves into them when threatened. Their hooklike tails latch onto crags within their rocks, making it difficult to dislodge their shells without great force. If their rocks break, Dwebble will become very agitated and not sleep or eat until they find new shells. In captivity, they have been known to use materials other than stone in order to construct their shells, including brick, asphalt, and concrete. However, most Dwebble prefer using rocks regardless of what other substances are closer or more abundant, perhaps because of the differing weights and densities of the materials. In deserts, shell-less Dwebble often make their homes in the pores of Hippowdon, cleaning out stuck rocks while searching for new abodes.","﻿Evolves into Crustle at Lvl 34","Research Notes","","Bug/Rock"," 1'00\" | 0.3 m"," 32.0 lbs | 14.5 kg"," "," ","

Crustle are able to survive for long periods of time without water, which is often scarce in their arid habitats. In fact, they dislike direct contact with the substance, retreating beneath their shells during even light rains. To fashion their shells, Crustle will carve blocks of dirt and stone from the solid earth directly beneath their feet. They are highly territorial and will compete with nearby Crustle for control of choice swathes of land. When fighting for territory, Crustle will attempt to shatter the shells of their opponents. Competitors with broken shells relinquish all of their land; they also become timid and weak, as they are unable to defend themselves until they can build new shells. Because Crustle carve their shells from the ground within their domains, Crustle from different areas will often sport rocks with differently-colored strata. Crustle appear to be able to distinguish foreign and native visitors from each other based on these alternately-colored layers.

Their most notable feature is the baggy skin around their waists; as Scraggy grow, they periodically shed their skins, as many other reptilian Pokémon do. Scraggy, however, do not discard their old skins. Instead, they allow them to hang around their waists. The intense heat of the desert sun dries the skins so that they are elastic, leather-like, and surprisingly resilient. When threatened, Scraggy will pull their skins up over their heads to protect themselves. Scraggy with baggier skin garner more respect amongst their peers. It is thought that Scraggy evolve once their skin has been stretched to its maximum limit. Though often seen playing with their fellow gang members in the wild, Scraggy can be very aggressive towards strangers. They will stare down foes that make eye contact with them, following by charging headfirst. Violent fights can break out when two Scraggy gangs come across each other.

If the leader with the smaller crest does not defer to the other, the two gangs will brawl viciously. Scrafty fight with powerful kicks strong enough to shatter concrete, though they appear deceivingly uninterested while brawling. As they kick, they pull their baggy skins over themselves to shield their bodies from harm; they can also cover their heads with skin “hoods.” Scrafty can also spit an acidic liquid from their mouths—actually regurgitated stomach acids—to deter foes. Though these Pokémon are notorious for their aggressiveness and territoriality, recent studies have revealed that Scrafty are in fact very protective of their fellow gang members, as well as of their family and of their territory.

They will attack objects blocking their patrol paths, attempting to blast holes into them for them to pass through. Based on texts found in the buried Relic Castle underneath the Desert Resort, some archaeologists have hypothesized that Sigilyph used to guard this ancient city that once stood in the desert, and are to this day following the same paths (or perhaps teaching their offspring to do so, as exactly how Sigilyph breed is still unclear) around the fallen city. Others believed they may have served as emissaries of the city's true guardians, performing miscellaneous tasks around the perimeter. Sigilyph possess psychic powers that they use against those that approach them, perhaps as a reflexive attempt to defend their old cities. Recently, a giant geoglyph depicting Sigilyph was found in the Desert Resort; what significance it holds is still unknown.","​Pokémon and all associated names and characters are trademarked and © 1995-2019 Nintendo. All non-original images are provided by Bulbapedia, © 1995-2019 Nintendo.No copyright infringement intended.","Research Notes","Psychic/Flying"," 4'07\" | 1.4 m"," 30.9 lbs | 14.0 kg"," Wonder Skin | Magic Guard |","Tinted Lens","Tinted Lens","

It is likely that this murmuring is the reason why historic archaeologists excavating burial grounds often reported “voices” emanating from the walls. Yamask always carry their golden masks with them at all times, and will become very stressed if they go missing. These Pokémon will often stare at their masks and begin to cry or mourn longingly for unknown reasons.

To travel, they extend their ethereal limbs and crawl quadrupedally; they are capable of transversing vertical walls and even ceilings in this manner. Popular legend states that Cofagrigus live in tombs to punish grave robbers that attempt to steal burial structures. They are said to wait and pose as solid gold coffins until robbers approach, at which point they grab them with their ghostly arms, open up their bodies, and trap them within, turning them into mummies. Some believe that these Pokémon once used to be ancient kings, whose spirits have forgotten that they were human. In reality, while these Pokémon are not yet fully understood, Cofagrigus have never been seen opening their bodies, let alone trapping people inside. The myth was likely fabricated to deter tourists from sneaking into and disturbing ruins.

Why fossils are found so frequently from this time period is unknown, but scientists hypothesize that some sort of massive storm or other disaster may have caused a mass extinction at the end of this era, wiping out many species and disturbing large amounts of sediment that quickly buried and fossilized their remains. Tirtouga can withstand intense pressure and can dive half a mile (0.8 kilometers) beneath the water’s surface. Though slow and clumsy on land, they nevertheless could beach themselves onto shores in order to capture unsuspecting prey. Indeed, some studies suggest that a sizable portion of their meals came from terrestrial prey.

Carracosta also have very strong jaws, which they use to chew up rocks, shells, bones, and metal ore. They periodically consume these materials in order to strengthen their thick shells, which can withstand bullets fired from point-blank range. It is believed that these Pokémon preyed primarily upon relatives of Omanyte and Omastar, deriving much of the calcium for their own shells from their meals. When Carracosta were first revived in modern times, scientists were unaware of their unusual diets and did not supply them with sufficient iron for their shells. Consequently, they chewed through steel beams supporting the research facility. Like Tirtouga, Carracosta went extinct because of competition from other Pokémon.

Many scientists even thought that Plume Fossils were merely hoaxes, perhaps the fossilized footprints of Pokémon mistaken for feathers. With DNA testing and the subsequent revival of Archen themselves, however, their existence was finally, undoubtedly, proven. Today, Archen are widely believed to be the ancestors of all modern bird Pokémon. They dwell in the treetops of warm jungles; despite their wing-like arms, however, Archen are unable to fly. Instead, they hop from branch to branch to get around. They are known to be very cowardly; though aggressive at first, they will quickly retreat when threatened.

Archeops are far faster on land than in the air, reaching speeds of up to 25 mph (40 km/h). Unfortunately, they are still very clumsy terrestrially, as their numerous feathers and heavy, wing-like arms make it difficult for them to stay balanced. Archeops compensate for their lack of agility with their high intelligence and ability to cooperate in flocks. Groups of Archeops will work together to surround and take down prey or gather fruit; they are able to innovate unique strategies in order to do so. Because of their clumsiness, though, any prey that do manage to outsmart them are almost guaranteed to escape. This likely was downfall of these Pokémon; though smart and cooperative, their ungainly movements made it difficult for them compete as faster, more agile predators evolved. A recent excavation revealed a  Helix-like fossil with Archeops bite marks on it, suggesting that not only did Archeops likely hunt relatives of Omanyte while extant, but also that these Pokémon frequented coastal environments to find food as well. Because Archeops feathers are so delicate, it takes a seasoned professional in order to properly restore their fossils; many Plume Fossils have accidentally been destroyed by shoddy work.","﻿Evolves from Archen at Lvl 37","Rock/Flying"," 4'07\" | 1.4 m"," 70.5 lbs | 32.0 kg"," Defeatist"," Flying | Water 3","Habitat","Habitat","

Groups of Gothita are known to congregate around and fixate upon the same spot in the air, leading some researchers to suggest that these Pokémon may be able to see and talk to things that no other beings can. No scientific studies have successfully proven this theory, however. The bow-like feelers that adorn their heads amplify their psychic powers. If these feelers are disturbed while Gothita are examining something, they will lose their concentration and snap out of their trances.","﻿Evolves into Gothorita at Lvl 32Gothorita evolves into Gothitelle at Lvl 41","Research Notes","","Psychic"," 1'04\" | 0.4 m"," 12.8 lbs | 5.8 kg"," Human-Like"," Human-Like","

Gothorita are nocturnal and are said to derive their psychic powers from starlight and constellations. These Pokémon will arrange stones to match the positions of the stars overhead and then levitate them in the air for unknown reasons. Many legends say this practice is a ritual that grants Gothorita the power to hypnotize and control the minds of unwary people and Pokémon nearby. Gothorita are believed to lead people away from their homes and into forests in this manner, wiping their memories along the way. Some legends even tell stories of how lonely Gothorita will hypnotize young children while they lay asleep on starry nights, manipulating them to play with the Gothorita as “friends.” For this reason, Gothorita in some areas are known as \"witches of the night.\" Despite these haunting tales, there is no scientific evidence that these Pokémon engage in such activities, and it is likely that these wild stories were simply spawned by their odd, inexplicable behaviors.","﻿Evolves from Gothita at Lvl 32Evolves into Gothitelle at Lvl 41","Research Notes","","Psychic"," 2'04\" | 0.7 m"," 39.7 lbs | 18.0 kg"," Human-Like"," Human-Like","

They can emit intense psychic powers capable of momentarily distorting space thousands of light-years away. These Pokémon are amazingly adept at reading star charts and examining the night sky, observing the positions and movements of celestial bodies in order to predict the future. Because of their foresight, people in ancient times used to consult Gothitelle for advice, predictions, and warnings. Many pieces of ancient literature around the world allude to translated prophecies given by these Pokémon. Gothitelle are also capable of showing cryptic images of their predictions to onlookers by projecting them onto the empty space surrounding them. They can predict the lifespans of other living creatures, including those of themselves, their friends, and their trainers. As a result, despite their great power, Gothitelle are often seen sad or crying because of what they know is ultimately inevitable for both themselves and their loved ones. It is said that if one ever manages to glimpse their true fate through a Gothitelle, one would go mad from the revelation.","﻿Gothita evolves into Gothorita at Lvl 32Evolves from Gothorita at Lvl 41","Psychic"," 4'11\" | 1.5 m"," 97.0 lbs | 44.0 kg"," Frisk | Competitive | Shadow Tag"," Human-Like","Habitat","Habitat","

They are enormous single-celled organisms that have developed specialized organelles analogous to the more complex organs of multicellular Pokémon. Their cell membranes enclose their green, gelatinous cytoplasm; the two substances guard Solosis from a staggering range of conditions, allowing them to survive virtually anywhere. Their membranes shield them from radiation and harsh weather, while their cytoplasm regulates their temperature and internal pressure. Because of these properties, Solosis cytoplasm is currently being researched for use in volcanic and benthic submersibles. Similarly, scientists are trying to replicate their membranes for applications in space travel. However, extreme blunt force is capable of tearing the membranes and allowing some fluid to leak out. Solosis have highly-developed, spiral-shaped organelles on the left sides of their heads that function like brains. They allows Solosis to wield moderate psychic powers and also enable them to communicate telepathically with others of their kind.","﻿Evolves into Duosion at Lvl 32Duosion evolves into Reuniclus at Lvl 41","Research Notes","","Psychic"," 1'00\" | 0.3 m"," 2.2 lbs | 1.0 kg"," Amorphous"," Amorphous","

They undergo mitosis to divide in two, but stop halfway; this leaves two sets of organelles in their bodies, but only a single cell membrane to contain them. Duosion are still technically a single cell, but because of their arrested development, they sometimes seem to act as two separate beings. This is because they quite literally have two separate “brains” (really the spiral-shaped organelles they had as Solosis, which have migrated into their heads from outside prior to mitosis). The two structures often act independently from one another, forcing Duosion to attempt to execute both actions simultaneously. This usually renders their movements jerky and erratic. Occasionally, both of their brain-like organelles will have the same thought, often due to experiencing a shared threat or initiating an innate reflex. The psychic powers of Duosion are strongest when this occurs--able to reach over half a mile (0.8 kilometers) away--as both organelles are able to act in unison rather than independently in order to focus their abilities.","﻿Evolves from Solosis at Lvl 32Evolves into Reuniclus at Lvl 41","Research Notes","","Psychic"," 2'00\" | 0.6 m"," 17.6 lbs | 8.0 kg"," Amorphous"," Amorphous","

The brain-like organelles they had as Solosis and Duosion have developed into networks similar to the nervous systems of multicellular beings. By connecting hands with other Reuniclus, these Pokémon can also connect their organelle networks and greatly amplify their psychic powers. Their pseudo-nervous systems enable them to manipulate their membranes and cytoplasm like quasi-muscular systems; they can grasp objects with their “hands” that, with the aid of psychic power, are strong enough to crush boulders. In fact, they seem to prefer fighting in this pseudo-physical way, with reinforced punches, rather than relying solely on psychokinesis. Reuniclus are capable of regenerating torn cell membranes and lost cytoplasm over time; however, damage to their nuclear membranes or their contents, as well as the organelles floating in their “arms,” is almost always permanent. Their cytoplasm is designed to cushion these vital structures. A popular urban legend states that drinking a Reuniclus's cytoplasm will grant one great wisdom. However, this legend is patently false, as the fluid is in fact highly toxic to most creatures if ingested; a famous ancient philosopher is said to have died attempting this very act.","Solosis evolves into Duosion at Lvl 32Evolves from Duosion at Lvl 41","Psychic"," 3'03\" | 1.0 m"," 44.3 lbs | 20.1 kg"," Overcoat | Magic Guard | Regenerator"," Amorphous","Habitat","Habitat","

Ducklett are excellent divers. They will spend long periods of time completely submerged as they search for food. Ducklett are poor fliers, however, so they rarely take to the air, even when endangered. If attacked in the water, Ducklett will splash about wildly to distract opponents as they escape. The splashing also alerts their mothers and siblings of approaching danger. Ducklett store water in flexible sacs within their bodies; on land, they can then spray this stored water from specialized feathers on their wings at the eyes of foes, briefly obscuring their vision as they frantically waddle away. Their distressed quacking will signal to their siblings to aid them in spraying more water as well, potentially blinding threats from all possible angles.","﻿Evolves into Swanna at Lvl 35","Research Notes","","Water/Flying"," 1'08\" | 0.5 m"," 12.1 lbs | 5.5 kg"," Water 1 | Flying"," Water 1 | Flying","

In Unova folklore, children are told that they arose from icicles that were bathed in the morning sun but wished with all of their might that they would not melt. However, their bodies do not truly resemble icicles, as they have ovoid heads covered by slush. This slush is very sensitive to heat and will melt almost immediately once the ambient air temperature rises above freezing point. Touching the slush with a finger will cause it to melt at the point of contact, exposing the icy heads that they cover. To keep their slush from melting, Vanillite will sleep buried within piles of snow. It is unclear what purpose this slush serves, however. Their breaths can reach a freezing -58°F (-50°C), keeping them cloaked in frosty air; they are sometimes sent out for mere seconds in warm areas to lower temperatures. Any longer than this, however, and their icy bodies will slowly begin to shrink. Their breaths can also freeze water in the air to form snow. Casteliacones, which are sold in Castelia City, Unova, are a popular regional version of soft-serve ice cream that superficially resemble Vanillite. The design was chosen because of how Vanillite are associated with cold weather.","﻿Evolves into Vanillish at Lvl 35Vanillish evolves into Vanilluxe at Lvl 47","Research Notes","","Ice"," 1'04\" | 0.4 m"," 12.6 lbs | 5.7 kg"," Mineral"," Mineral","

Vanillish can freeze water in the air into icy mist that can blind and even freeze foes solid in this manner. They drink water from glacial streams and store it within their bodies, simultaneously expelling and freezing it from pores in their bodies to freeze enemies solid before headbutting and shattering them. Vanillish cannot tolerate temperatures even slightly above the freezing point of water, as the slush covering their heads would melt and leave their icy cores exposed. Because of this, they are naturally confined to frozen peaks and glaciers. Despite this, they are very popular in the tropics due to their air-chilling abilities; trainers in regions like Alola must treat their Vanillish periodically with insulating spray to keep them cold; such individuals also tend to be smaller than those found in polar areas. Though once widespread during a past ice age, areas suitable for Vanillish and their relatives shrank and became isolated from each other during a warming period, separated by bands of warmer temperatures that they could not cross. Today, they can only be found in the icy parts of the southern hemisphere and a select few other chilly areas. Vanillish are surprisingly kind Pokémon; they dislike violence and prefer to immobilize attackers just long enough for them to flee without harming them any further.","﻿Evolves from Vanillite at Lvl 35Evolves into Vanilluxe at Lvl 47","Research Notes","","Ice"," 3'07\" | 1.1 m"," 90.4 lbs | 41.0 kg","Ice Body | Snow Cloak | ​Weak Armor","Ice Body | Snow Cloak | ​Weak Armor","

For example, their heads will experience the same emotions at the same time; they may, however, express the emotions differently with their facial expressions and behaviors. They can survive with only one head, however. It was once believed that Vanilluxe formed when two Vanllish, partially melted from the day's heat, stuck together and refroze together during the night. Vanilluxe drinks large quantities of glacial water to store within  their bodies. When both heads feel threatened , Vanilluxe will freeze and violently release their stored water as snow clouds or blizzards. This attack is indiscriminate and can freeze both friend and foe. The pipe-like structures growing out of their left heads constantly emit icy mist that shrouds them, keeping the ambient air sufficiently cold to prevent their slush from melting and concealing them from attackers. This icy mist eventually settles to create piles of snow, making these Pokémon incredibly popular amongst snowboarders and skiers. When Vanilluxe stop producing this mist, it is a sign that they are thirsty need more water to freeze and release.","﻿Vanillite evolves into Vanillish at Lvl 35Evolves from Vanillish at Lvl 47","Ice"," 4'03\" | 1.3 m"," 126.8 lbs | 57.5 kg"," ","Ice Body | Snow Warning | ​Weak Armor"," Mineral"," Mineral","

Deerling are most famous for their ability to change color in accordance with the seasons. These Pokémon are pink in the spring (to blend in with budding flowers), green in the summer (to camouflage with verdant vegetation), orange in the fall (to match autumn leaves), and brown in the winter (to hide against bare trees).Their scents also change to match that of the vegetation of each season, in order to further conceal themselves from predators. Their fur’s hue is also affected by temperature and humidity. When near the equator, where seasons are less pronounced than in temperate areas, Deerling may only change color slightly or even not at all.

These plants obtain nutrients from the vegetation Sawsbuck eat, and in turn provide them with camouflage to hide in the surrounding environments. In the spring, the flowers budding on their antlers match those growing around them. In the summer and autumn, vivid leaves grow and change color to let Sawsbuck blend in with the trees of the forest. Finally, in the winter, white moss grows over their antlers and fur to allow them to conceal themselves in snow. Sawsbuck herds are led by the individuals with the largest antlers and most beautiful plants growing on them. These Pokémon migrate to different areas each season; because of this, people often refer to them as the “harbingers of spring,” because they return to their initial habitats once spring comes around again.

Though rather clumsy on the ground, Emolga are agile both in the trees and in the air. To avoid predators, Emolga will leap from one tree branch and glide to another while attempting to shock them from above in hopes of knocking them to the ground. Their aerial agility allows them to escape from the vast majority of terrestrial predators, though unfavorable weather conditions and storms may hinder their abilities. Emolga nest in the nooks of tree branches or the hollows of tree trunks in holes made by Pikipek. These Pokémon will collect nuts and Berries and store them near their nests in preparation for winter. Emolga will defend their nests very fiercely with electric shocks; this keeps most avian Pokémon away from their otherwise-vulnerable food caches. When thunderstorms arrive, whole populations Emolga will take flight, sometimes amassing in large enough numbers to blot out the sky.","​Pokémon and all associated names and characters are trademarked and © 1995-2019 Nintendo. All non-original images are provided by Bulbapedia, © 1995-2019 Nintendo.No copyright infringement intended.","Electric/Flying"," 1'04\" | 0.4 m"," 11.0 lbs | 5.0 kg"," Static | Motor Drive"," Field","Habitat","Habitat","

This acid rarely has a lasting impact on larger foes, however (unless it makes contact with the eyes or other vulnerable locations), so Karrablast often choose to hide in trees or grasses instead to avoid detection. These Pokémon feed on soft-bodied mollusks, dissolving their vulnerable insides with acid while leaving their shells intact. They spend much of their time searching for Shelmet to facilitate their evolutions. When they find them, Karrablast will use their horns to pry the Shelmet out of their shells, which they steal for themselves. With some sort of electrical stimulus, such as a trade, both Pokémon can then evolve. In the wild, competition for Shelmet can be fierce between Karrablast, who will invade each other’s territories and spar with rivals for Shelmet.

Though very slow in practice, Escavalier have been known to reach surprisingly high speeds by charging to gain momentum and then leaping so that they “fly” at foes, piercing even the toughest armor with their lances. Because of how much time and space Escavalier need to charge up, however, they rarely are able to execute this technique in battle. Escavalier have a reputation for being brave and courageous Pokémon. They will not give up in fights until they are defeated, no matter how bleak the odds appear to be.

A recent, promising hypothesis regarding the cap pattern postulates that while the design is unconvincing from close range, it is sufficient for deterring avian Pokémon—one of their major groups of predators—flying above. In addition to this questionable camouflage, Foongus also have the ability to release poisonous spores to defend themselves from foes.

In the damp, dark areas where Amoonguss dwell, low light levels make such camouflage even less effective, as the red coloration of the caps are dulled and made even less recognizable. Rather than providing a survival advantage, their cap designs appear to be remnants of their pre-evolutions’ survival tactic; because Amoonguss can protect themselves in other ways, their Poké Ball patterns have survived as well despite contributing little to their survival. Like Foongus, Amoonguss are capable of spreading poisonous, incapacitating spores in the air around them.

They float slowly, but silently and stealthily in the ocean currents. Victims almost never notice these Pokémon approaching until it is too late. To capture prey, Frillish wrap their ribbon-like tentacles around their victims, paralyzing them with an incapacitating poison injected by the near-invisible spines lining these appendages. Females tend to have slightly longer spines. Then, Frillish drag their prey down into the ocean depths and back to their lairs, where victims succumb to the crushing pressure of the water above and drown. Because of their eerie natures and vaguely humanoid appearances, some believe that Frillish are actually the reincarnated souls of sailors lost at sea, or perhaps the residents of an ancient sunken city.

In fact, their body compositions are almost exactly identical to the composition of seawater. Many seafaring legends warn of Jellicent swarms, cautioning that no ship or crew has ever entered a Jellicent habitat and returned. Indeed, Jellicent do seem to have an unusual affinity for human ships; between these Pokémon and Dragalge, nearly all cases of “vanishing” vessels are accounted for. They tend to be found more frequently near cruise ships and tankers full of passengers. Jellicent feed on life force, leaving victims as empty husks that sink down into the ocean depths. They even seem to congregate at the ocean's surface on nights of the full moon, when ships are most plentiful. Their crowns are thought to grow larger the more life force they consume. It is said that on the ocean floor lies a Jellicent castle made of sunken shipwrecks.

Alomomola enjoy “sunbathing,” lying down horizontally just beneath the surface. They are covered in mucoid membranes that are famous for their healing properties. These altruistic Pokémon will bring injured creatures they find close to them and envelop them in their membranes while in their “sunbathing” positions before carrying them back to shore like rafts. Many ocean Pokémon congregate near them because of this. There has been at least one reported case of an Alomomola carrying a drowning human child to safety in this manner. Scientists believe that this altruistic behavior may have evolved to help Alomomola defend themselves from nearby predators; though slow, these Pokémon stand a better chance against predators when partnered with newly-healed allies. Unfortunately, because of their special membranes, Alomomola have become targets for oceanic poachers in recent years. Perhaps due to their healing membranes, Alomomola are oddly immune to many common poisons, including that of marine Pokémon like Frillish and Tentacool. Alomomola in fact primarily prey on these species, which most other Pokémon avoid due to their incapacitating toxins. These Pokémon were, and still are, a favorite amongst long-distance sailors, helping treat injuries while out at sea and away from professional medical care.","​Pokémon and all associated names and characters are trademarked and © 1995-2019 Nintendo. All non-original images are provided by Bulbapedia, © 1995-2019 Nintendo.No copyright infringement intended.","Water"," 3'11\" | 1.2 m"," 69.7 lbs | 31.6 kg"," Healer | Hydration |"," Regenerator","Habitat","Habitat","

Joltik store this electricity in small pouches within their bodies; they can release it to stun opponents when threatened. Joltik cannot generate electricity, so they require hosts charge. The relationship between a Joltik and its host is usually mutualistic; the Joltik feeds on generated static electricity while defending the host from predators with stunning shocks. Joltik attached to Electric-type Pokémon, however, can be problematic, as they will begin to drain the internal electricity of their hosts alongside the static electricity they naturally generate. In cities, Joltik have been observed feeding from power outlets or directly from generators, occasionally causing minor blackouts.

Galvantula use these webs to immobilize prey when hunting as well as to slow down attackers pursuing them. They will lay down stunning webs near the nests of avian Pokémon to catch chicks that are still poor at flying. As a secondary measure, these Pokémon have very strong mandibles and are capable of pinning down struggling foes until they succumb to paralysis in their silk prisons. Additionally, they can even fire charged bristles from their abdomens to paralyze fleeing prey, leaving them stunned for up to three days. After taking down prey, Galvantula will then proceed to consume their meals over the course of a few days. Despite their menacing appearances, Galvantula are not aggressive Pokémon.

These heavy Pokémon can be found stuck to the walls and ceilings of caves, absorbing minerals through their spikes. When they have finished draining one location of nutrients, they will roll (on walls) or drop down (from ceilings) to new locations—hikers must constantly be aware of what is above them, since Ferroseed can and will drop without any notice; in Chargestone Cave of the Unova region, injuries from falling Ferroseed actually are the most common cause of harm. Though unintentionally dangerous, Ferroseed are acutally rather docile Pokémon. They won’t attack unless attacked first, and even when faced an aggressor, the most a Ferroseed will do is release a burst of spikes being rolling away to safety.

To hunt, these creatures hang idly from the tops of caves, waiting for unsuspecting victims to pass underneath. When they come along, Ferrothorn fire barrages of spikes to subdue them before dropping down below to claim their meals. Ferrothorn will also scrape away at cavern walls to siphon exposed minerals and ores using their spikes. Their feelers are deceptively strong, capable of supporting their weight and allowing them to “stand” upright on the ground. In this stance, Ferrothorn can swing their feelers like flails to attack foes. The tips of these feelers are strong enough to pulverize stone. Their hard, spiked bodies protect them from most attackers; however, they are also very sensitive to heat. Ferrothorn will seek shelter in the damp recesses of their caverns if they feel the air warming. Excessively heat can cause their normally-sturdy bodies to soften slightly, rendering them vulnerable to further attacks. Spelunkers in Unova’s Chargestone Cave are advised to use torches instead of lamps in order to scare off wild Ferrothorn.","﻿Evolves from Ferroseed at Lvl 40","Grass/Steel"," 3'03\" | 1.0 m"," 242.5 lbs | 110.0 kg"," Iron Barbs | Anticipation"," Grass | Mineral","Habitat","Habitat","

"599","Klink","599","Caves, industrial areas","Klink are odd Pokémon that were first discovered within Chargestone Cave in Unova. According to the region’s premier Pokémon researcher Professor Juniper, the earliest evidence regarding their existence dates back just over a century. While their origins are unknown, today, these Pokémon can be found in industrial areas in addition to Chargestone Cave. The two units that comprise a Klink are each known as “minigears.” Though they appear identical, no two minigears are alike; each one fits into exactly one other minigear, while any others ones that attempt to interlock are rejected. Once two minigears join to form a Klink, they will begin to spin effortlessly to generate energy, jumpstarted by magnetic force. The spin from one unit pushes the other, which pushes back, and so on as a perpetual motion system. If Klink become separated after interlocking, both minigears will enter an inert state. By interlocking them again and setting them in motion, however, they will reanimate as if nothing had happened. Some modern archaeologists believe that Klink inspired ancient peoples in the Galar region to design primitive gears based on recent evidence; they hypothesize that Klink disappeared from subsequent historical records alongside the people that had worked with them.","﻿Evolves into Klang at Lvl 38Klang evolves into Klinklang at Lvl 49","Research Notes","","Steel"," 1'00\" | 0.3 m"," 46.3 lbs | 21.0 kg"," Mineral"," Mineral","

These additional gears give these Pokémon a greater range of abilities; by spinning each of their gears at varying speeds, Klang can communicate with each other. Direction appears to indicate emotions, while speed relates to the intensity of these feelings. Like Klink, Klang are powered by the perpetual spinning of their minigears. The loss of a gear will cause them to become inert; in the wild, this is essentially akin to death, as it is unlikely that minigears will be able to reattach themselves without the ability to move (though this problem is less distressing for Klang under the command of trainers). To attack, Klang will fire one of their minigears in such a way that it will hit the opponent and then arc back to its initial location. The two unfired gears continue spinning during this period thanks to their angular momentum. After their minigears hit their targets and return, these Pokémon will expend energy to return their spinning to normal speeds. In extreme situations, Klang will adjust their minigears such that all three connect and spin in tandem; this sharply increases their rotation speed and combat prowess. Klang are commonly seen as symbols of industrial progress and are a popular logo in Galar.","﻿Evolves from Klink at Lvl 38Evolves into Klinklang at Lvl 49","Research Notes","","Steel"," 2'00\" | 0.6 m"," 112.4 lbs | 51.0 kg"," Mineral"," Mineral","

These additions enable Klinklang to stay active even when missing gears or not spinning. Their energy cores will glow more weakly when they are nearly drained; if a Klinklang’s light goes out, it means that it has exhausted all of its stored energy and will enter an inert state just like its pre-evolutions. The fourth gears also serve secondary purposes as weapons in battle. By spinning these gears quickly, Klinklang can rapidly charge their cores and cause them to glow brightly. Then, they can release the stored electrical nergy through the spikes on their large gears to blast opponents. Their multiple gears also grant them a number of exclusive techniques, such as Gear Shift and Gear Grind.

These Pokémon tend to congregate in damper areas where they can easily access water to keep themselves hydrated. They have tiny organs that generates minute electrical charges they can use to shock foes, though the weak voltage fails to significantly hinder opponents. Tynamo, however, find strength in numbers; while individually weak, many Tynamo emitting their shocks together can create jolts as strong as bolts of lightning. When threatened, a school of Tynamo will ball tightly together so that any foes that attempt to attack will be met with discharged electricity from the entire group. In some regions, the tiny shocks of electricity from a lone Tynamo were traditionally used to numb small regions of the body prior to invasive medical operations.","﻿Evolves into Eelektrik at Lvl 39Eelektrik evolves into Eelektross with a Thunder Stone","Research Notes","","Electric"," 0'08\" | 0.2 m"," 0.7 lbs | 0.3 kg"," Amorphous"," Amorphous","

When they come across suitable prey, Eelektric will rush at their victims and quickly coil their bodies around them, paralyzing them with electricity to prevent their escape. Eelektrik will begin searching for another meal immediately after eating, as they are voracious eaters. If unable to find small prey for long periods of time, these species will even go after larger, slow-moving Pokémon such as Alomomola or even Wailord. Instead of constricting and shocking them, however, Eelektrik will dart in and sink their teeth into their sides, tearing out circular holes of flesh and swimming away before the larger Pokémon are able to react.

To subdue larger victims, they latch onto them with their teeth and let loose powerful electric shocks. Capable of both levitating and waddling on land with their flippers, Eelektross will ambush unsuspecting prey on the shore. They will grab victims with their arms before sinking in their fangs, electrocuting them, and dragging them into the sea. These Pokémon are territorial, claiming large swathes of shoreline as their own. They engage in displays of dominance using the crest-like fins on their heads to assert themselves.

While many amateur UFO enthusiasts have took it upon themselves to research the origins of Elgyem, no concrete evidence has been found pointing to them originating from outer space (curiously, despite the media commotion these Pokémon caused upon discovery, no public large-scale or government-funded research has been conducted regarding Elgyem). These Pokémon appear to communicate by flashing the lights on their hands. They seem to be highly inquisitive about novel objects, examining and playing with them using their psychokinetic powers. Though not inherently aggressive, Elgyem will use their powerful psychic abilities to give foes crippling headaches when threatened. Those afflicted often wake up with no memory of what had occurred.

Based on the behavior of Elgyem, Beheeyem likely use these lights to communicate with each other. Also like Elgyem, many conspiracy theories surround the origins and even existence of Beheeyem. One of the most popular proposes an explanation as to why the UFO they supposedly arrived on was never recovered—the Beheeyem erased the memories of witnesses immediately after the crash, disposing of the debris and leaving nobody with any recollection of the event. Some also theorize that Beheeyem use their abilities to thwart research on themselves and Elgyem, which is why there have been no major studies on these Pokémon to date.

However, approach it and it will suddenly spring alive, its wick bursting into flames as it smiles cheerfully. This is the primary hunting strategy of Litwick; when living beings approach, they light up and pretend to guide them through dark areas, or provide them warmth during a cold night. They are actually absorbing and burning the life energy of these beings as fuel, eventually sending them into the spirit world. Litwick will intentionally take wrong turns and go in circles to stall time as they continues to burn life energy. If a Litwick runs out of this energy, its flame will go out, and it will need to absorb more lifer force in order to light up again. Litwick are said to especially prefer luring away children, as younger lives give them more energy. They will even take young children by the hand to ensure that they follow along to \"play.\" When under the control of trainer, assuming that the Litwick is well-fed and trained, it will likely not attempt to burn the life energy of others as fuel.

"610","Axew","610","Caves, riversides","Axew are territorial Pokémon that tend to live in caves near rivers. Their most distinctive features are the two tusks protruding from either sides of their mouths. Axew use these tusks to leave gashes on tree trunks to mark their territories. Initially, these tusks are very brittle and prone to breaking off. However, when an Axew’s tusk breaks, it will grow back stronger and sturdier than it was before. This gradual strengthening encourages Axew to test their tusks on increasingly hard objects, from wood to stone to even metal. Axew tusks grow back quickly and are primarily used to defend the Pokémon as well as crack open hard Berries for them to eat. Young Axew will compete with one another to crack the hardest Berries as displays of strength. Axew ivory jewelry, crafted from the tusks of these Pokémon, has been recently popularized as a sustainable and ethical alternative to traditional (and now illegal) Donphan ivory. Since Axew tusks not only break off harmlessly but also grow back quickly, Axew ivory is constantly in abundance.

Unlike Axew, a Fraxure’s tusks will not regenerate; if one breaks off in combat, the Fraxure will be rendered handicapped, not only in battle but in simple movement, as the tusks also provides these Pokèmon with balance. For this reason, Fraxure spend much of their time whetting their tusks on river rocks, sharpening them as much as possible to ensure clean slices instead of dull hits. These tusks are capable of shattering boulders without breaking. Fraxure are fiercely territorial; a fight between two Fraxure over land can be very gruesome, as neither will back down until the other is either maimed or without a tusk. These Pokémon will become anxious if they are not able to sharpen their tusks; they sometimes will even forgo searching for food in favor of looking for suitable stones to whet their tusks on.

Despite this territoriality, Haxorus are actually very docile, even kind, when it comes to others that they do not view as threats. These Pokémon have been known to cut down trees to help smaller Pokémon cross fast-moving rivers or slice open hard Berries and nuts for weaker Pokémon to eat. In battle, Haxorus can use a number of physical Dragon-type attacks to batter foes.

This substance is actually a molecularly complex, supercooled viscous colloid that serves as the source of their ice powers. By sucking this substance back into their noses, Cubchoo can freeze water within their bodies to utilize in Ice-type attacks. Cubchoo will spread the snot on enemies to chill them and slow them down; they are also known to do this to people and Pokémon they dislike. Like mucus, Cubchoo “snot” consists primarily of water and glycoproteins in addition to the chemicals that give it its supercooling properties. Glycoproteins are what give both mucus and Cubchoo snot their characteristic viscosity; when Cubchoo are sick, they produce fewer of these thickening glycoproteins, making their snot less sticky and more watery than usual. This consequently also makes their Ice-type attacks weaker.  Thus, trainers can easily discern the health of their Cubchoo based on the viscosity of their this substance; thick and sticky snot that holds together well indicates healthy Cubchoo, while thin and runny snot indicates ill ones.","﻿Evolves into Beartic at Lvl 37","Research Notes","","Ice"," 1'08\" | 0.5 m"," 18.7 lbs | 8.5 kg"," Field"," Field","

They use this ability to encase their paws and mouths with claws and fangs of ice, respectively, to attack foes. To cross large stretches of ocean, these Pokémon will freeze the waters beneath their paws, creating pathways of ice for them to walk on. They are also adept swimmers that spend much of their time hunting in the water; when tired, they will simply freeze the water beneath them to rest, creating new ice floes. With their thick fur and wide paws, Beartic are adapted to moving and living in icy environments.

Trainers can give their Cryogonal the same anti-melting “medicine” many Ice-types are treated with in order to raise their melting points considerably, though these Pokémon still dislike heat. Because of they can seemingly appear from thin air in cold weather, some believe that Cryogonal are born in snow clouds; many of them suddenly appear alongside snow as the air temperature drops. Cryogonal hunt by ensnaring prey in chains of ice released from their mouths that reach -148°F (-100°C), freezing them in seconds.

Similarly, Shelmet that have lost their shells to Karrablast while simultaneously being stimulated with electrical energy—for example, a trade—will evolve into Accelgor. Shelmet tend to be vey cautious and aversive towards novel stimuli, however, so they will often attempt to flee from Karrablast despite needing them for evolution. To deter attackers, Shelmet can spit a sticky, poisonous substance that adheres to and irritates skin upon contact. They will then close their shells to protect their vulnerable bodies from damage.

Druddigon will lie patiently in waiting for hapless prey to wander into their lairs. Then, they will charge headfirst through their narrow tunnels to take their victims down. Because they are unable to regulate their own body temperatures, Druddigon must periodically sunbathe in order to regain heat. Their wings, with their broad surface area and ability to lay nearly flat against the backs of these creatures, are specially adapted to maximize the amount of heat absorbed from sunlight. These wings are useless for flight and are primarily used for this purpose. If Druddigon are unable to stay sufficiently warm, their muscles will begin to stiffen and become as hard as stone, rendering them unable to move. For this reason, Druddigon will dig holes periodically into the ceilings of their tunnels to allow for easy access to sunlight.","​Pokémon and all associated names and characters are trademarked and © 1995-2019 Nintendo. All non-original images are provided by Bulbapedia, © 1995-2019 Nintendo.No copyright infringement intended.","Dragon"," 5'03\" | 1.6 m"," 306.4 lbs | 139.0 kg"," Rough Skin | Sheer Force | Mold Breaker"," Dragon | Monster","Habitat","Habitat","

"622","Golett","622","Ruins","Golett are mysterious Pokémon that are most often found in ancient ruins and vaults. They were first discovered by archaeologists excavating a buried temple in Unova. Analysis of their body compositions have found that these Pokémon are made primarily of a substance that is strikingly similar to clay, particularly that of the pottery often found in the ruins that Golett inhabit. Additionally, carbon dating has traced individual, living Golett back nearly 2,000 years—again, roughly the same amount of time as the earthenware they were found with. The ages, composition, and habitats of Golett have left many scientists befuddled as to their origins. Some more “creative” scientists have speculated that Golett were once inanimate clay statues, brought to life by the lost technological methods of an ancient civilization to defend the society from harm. These creatures seem to compulsively line up nearby boulders into neat rows, forming precise geometric patterns. Some say they are following their ancient masters' orders to build walls or geoglyphs. One final mystery regarding Golett is their energy sources, which are located within their torsos. This energy glows brightly when the Pokémon attack; to this day, no one has been able to identify exactly what it is. Because of their age, scientists hypothesize that unless their energy is somehow infinite, Golett must run out of energy at some fixed point in time, either in the near or distant future. ","﻿Evolves into Golurk at Lvl 43","Ground/Ghost"," 3'03\" | 1.0 m"," 202.8 lbs | 92.0 kg"," Iron Fist | Klutz |"," No Guard","Habitat","Habitat","

Some believe that these Pokémon were crafted from clay by ancient people and Pokémon in order to protect their cities; they follow orders unwaveringly and unceasingly until told to do otherwise. Ruins of ancient fortresses sport artillery platforms believed to be perches for defending Golurk to fire attacks from. Though it may not seem like it, Golurk are capable of flight; they can reach Mach speeds by pulling their arms and legs into their bodies and expelling their internal energy to propel themselves like rockets across the sky. They can create sonic booms in this manner upon breaking the sound barrier. The mysterious energy inside these Pokémon appears to be infinite, though this has yet to be proven—Golurk can fly for extremely long periods of time without eating or even tiring. Indeed, this energy appears to be so powerful that their bodies can barely contain it; almost all known Golurk have cracks running across their torsos that indicate this energy attempting to escape, held back by seals patching the seams shut. Some believe that removing these seals will cause Golurk to release all of their energy at once, leading to disastrous results. According to legend, removing a Golurk's seal is the only way to stop it from following it's master's orders, though the Pokémon will also begin to rampage uncontrollably as a result.","﻿Evolves from Golett at Lvl 43","Ground/Ghost"," 9'02\" | 2.8 m"," 727.5 lbs | 330.0 kg"," Iron Fist | Klutz |"," No Guard","Habitat","Habitat","

"624","Pawniard","624","Badlands, highlands, near rivers","Pawniard prowl around in packs on rocky badlands and highlands. They are always led by a single Bisharp to which they are entirely subservient. These Pokémon essentially exercise no judgement on their own; they only act when commanded to do so by their Bisharp. Pawniard viciously attack foes using the many blades on their bodies. They will latch onto their victims by jumping onto them and sinking their torso blades into their flesh before swinging their hands and heads around to further slice foes. They will clang their blades together following a successful strike. While a single Pawniard alone can do significant harm to a foe, the work of a pack can easily be fatal to unprotected opponents. Pawniard do not react to their own injuries or wounds, as they are entirely occupied in taking down the victims their Bisharp have selected. These Pokémon will sharpen their blades on river rocks when they dull; this can be an arduous process, given the number of blades they possess. Each Pawniard has its favorite sharpening stone, and will become quite upset if it is touched or otherwise moved. If the Bisharp leader of a pack goes missing, the strongest Pawniard of the pack will be quickly promoted to leader by evolving. Though they would never dream of betraying their leader, individual Pawniard in a pack will train tirelessly to achieve this spot should their Bisharp ever fall.","﻿Evolves into Bisharp at Lvl 52","Research Notes","","Dark/Steel"," 1'08\" | 0.5 m"," 22.5 lbs | 10.2 kg"," Human-Like"," Human-Like","

Though completely capable of overwhelming and taking out foes much larger than themselves, packs of Pawniard will cease to attack opponents once they are rendered immobile so that their leader Bisharp can finish them off. There can only be one Bisharp in a pack; if a Pawniard in a pack evolves, it will have to fight the leading Bisharp for control of the the group. Losers are exiled and left pack-less, forced to roam in search of stray Pawniard to recruit (or another Bisharp with Pawniard to duel). Bisharp demand strict obedience from their Pawniard and are ruthless in retribution if crossed. Bisharp whose head blades are chipped will retire permanently and become lone hunters, unable to hold command a Pawniard pack. Many urban myths surround these Pokémon, warning that they order their Pawniard to practice their hunting skills on unsuspecting human and Pokémon travelers in the mountains at night. While these cautionary tales are present wherever Bisharp are, there have been no confirmed cases of such an event ever occurring to date. Bisharp often compete with Fraxure for choice sharpening stones near rivers.","﻿Evolves from Pawniard at Lvl 52","Dark/Steel"," 5'03\" | 1.6 m"," 154.3 lbs | 70.0 kg"," Defiant | Inner Focus | Pressure"," Human-Like","Habitat","Habitat","

Bouffalant herds are territorial; they will break into stampedes when intruders draw near as they all attempt to charge at the invaders at once. The thick tuft of fur on a Bouffalant’s head is incredibly shock-absorbent, allowing it to headbutt with enough force to derail a train without feeling any significant knockback. This fur is also a symbol of dominance among Bouffalant. Individuals with the largest and most luxurious head fur have the first choice of mates during breeding season and are the first to graze if food is scarce. Interestingly, these Pokémon also respond to similar-looking hair among other beings, including humans. Herds charging at travelers have been known to suddenly stop upon noticing that one of the visitors has a particularly voluminous afro.","​Pokémon and all associated names and characters are trademarked and © 1995-2019 Nintendo. All non-original images are provided by Bulbapedia, © 1995-2019 Nintendo.No copyright infringement intended.","Normal"," 5'03\" | 1.6 m"," 208.3 lbs | 94.5 kg"," Reckless | Sap Sipper | Soundproof"," Field","Habitat","Habitat","

Slightly older individuals may even challenge their guardians to a fight in order to prove themselves worthy of care. For the first few weeks of their lives, Rufflet are fed by their parents. Afterwards, however, they are pushed out of their nests to forage for food (though they return afterwards). They use their strong talons to grasp and crack hard nuts and Berries as well as peck at prey; they prefer meat and seafood, but they cannot always obtain it easily. Their powerful legs and claws do enable them to crack the carapaces of crustaceans and shellfish, however. While on their own, they must fend for themselves against predators. Rufflet will fearlessly stand their ground against foes much stronger than themselves. They are even known to initiate battles with larger Pokémon when unprovoked (though they will often begin crying if they lose). Rufflet become stronger through this frequent fighting.

In fact, scars are a sign of dedication among Braviary, and individuals with more front-facing scars are held in higher regard--however, those with many scars on their backs are mocked as cowards. Their talons are very strong and can dig into solid steel. Additionally, Braviary can lift objects as heavy as cars with their talons. Though strong and capable of long-distance flight, their belligerence makes them poor choices for public transportation (a role that Corviknight fills better in regions like Galar). Because of what Braviary represent, their feathers are often used as decorations in a number of traditions. Soldiers wounded while defending their nations in war, for example, are honored with badges depicting stylized crests of Braviary feathers; the number of feathers depends on the extent of the bravery the soldier displayed.

Siblings will squabble with one another for comfy bones. Partially due to their voracious appetites, Vullaby undergo multiple growth spurts and require new bones each time, with the old ones being passed on to younger chicks. The bones also protect their rears, as these Pokémon are clumsy and often fall while waddling around. However, they are also heavy, so when Vullaby near evolution and prepare to fly, they will discard their skulls. Vullaby are not picky eaters and will consume whatever their mothers bring back to them or wanders close enough for them to chase. Vullaby almost always try to pursue prey weaker than themselves, sometimes purely for enjoyment; they quickly will give up chase, however. They do not enjoy walking much, so they will only finish hunting down prey when food is scarce. Despite this, they can often be seen hopping excitedly as they try in vain to take flight.

Mandibuzz then carry their prey back to their nests. These Pokémon have an affinity for bones, which they collect to decorate their own bodies as well as build their meticulously-crafted nests—ominous-looking piles of bones in badlands are almost invariably abandoned Mandibuzz nests. Many of these bones will invariably be those of Cubone and Marowak, due to their shared penchant for bone-collecting. They will root through carcasses already picked clean of flesh by other scavengers for desirable bones. Mandibuzz (as well as Vullaby) have abnormally strong stomach acids that allow them to consume rotting flesh without becoming ill. These Pokémon are often regarded as omens of death in popular culture; the sight of a Mandibuzz circling overhead in a barren wasteland is a harrowing symbol for tired travelers, indicating that the end is near. Despite their opportunistic natures, these Pokémon are quite maternal and will adopt orphaned Vullaby from other mothers and raise them as their own. Mandibuzz were one thought to adorn bones to attract mates, but it is now it is more commonly believed that they serve simply as protection.

Heatmor breathe through holes in their tails. To attack, they pass some of the air they inhale through a special organ in their bodies that combusts the oxygen in the air, allowing the Pokémon to spew out flames. If these organs clogs up, then Heatmor will quickly fall ill from a lack of sufficient airflow. The insides of a Heatmor are constantly burning, much like a furnace. The tubular structures that run across a Heatmor’s torso facilitate the flow of air within their bodies for respiration and combustion. Heatmor can also spew smoke out of their tails to create diversions against opponents.

Just as the older brother of Unova legend did, Reshiram seeks to create a world founded upon the search for absolute truths. It is said that Reshiram will appear to those passionate in searching for truths and aid them in their quests; however, if they stray from this path and choose to lie for personal gain, Reshiram will burn everything around it before disappearing.","Also see Zekrom and Kyurem","Legendary","Dragon/Fire"," 10'06\" | 3.2 m"," 727.5 lbs | 330.0 kg"," Turboblaze"," Undiscovered"," Undiscovered","

"644","Zekrom","644","Unova","Zekrom is said to have been created during an ancient Unova war. According to legend, the two brothers that founded Unova disagreed about the future of the region—the older brother sought truth while the younger brother pursued ideals. During the conflict that broke out in the region between them, the Dragon-type Pokémon aiding them split in two; Zekrom sided with the ideal-seeking younger brother. The sons of the brothers continued the conflict despite their fathers calling a truce, leading Reshiram and Zekrom to destroy the region and then disappear. Zekrom’s tail functions a powerful generator, enabling it to discharge earth-scorching lightning. As the dragon of ideals, Zekrom aids those who pursue achievement, perfection, and personal beliefs. It desires to form a world based on striving for elusive ideals. In legends, Zekrom is said to appear to people who demonstrate strong personal convictions and faiths and help them pursue these beliefs. It will destroy its surroundings and vanish if they end up betraying their own ideals, however.","Also see Reshiram and Kyurem","Legendary","Dragon/Electric"," 9'06\" | 2.9 m"," 760.6 lbs | 345.0 kg"," Teravolt"," Undiscovered"," Undiscovered","

As Landorus flies over fields of crops, it enriches the soil and ensures bountiful harvests. Farmers often pray to Landorus in hopes that it will visit their fields in order to ensure abundance. In addition to helping crops grow, Landorus also aids in stopping the Pokémon Tornadus and Thundurus from wreaking havoc with storms while together. According to mythology, Landorus will break up the pair and punish them if they come too close to each other, as their combined powers would form a catastrophic storm. In images, Landorus is most often depicted in its humanoid Incarnate Forme. It is thought that this is not Landorus’s true appearance, but merely the form that most people and Pokémon can see. Its real form, its Therian Forme, can only be viewed by gazing through a mysterious artifact known as the Reveal Glass.","Therian Forme","Legendary","Ground/Flying"," 4'11\" | 1.5 m"," 149.9 lbs | 68.0 kg"," Sand Force | Sheer Force (Incarnate Forme) || Intimidate (Therian Forme)"," Undiscovered"," Undiscovered","

However, the siblings began to quarrel over their goals; the fight eventually led to a war, and the Pokémon aiding them split in two—Reshiram and Zekrom. Kyurem is thought to be the empty husk left behind, longing to be whole again. It froze itself in ice in order to keep its feeble body from decaying. In Lacunosa Town, Unova, Kyurem is said to have arrived upon an icy meteor that landed near the town, creating the Giant Chasm. Residents believe that it roams around at night to eat locals, so they have built walls around the town and stay indoors after dark. Aside from this local myth, most believe that Kyurem indeed is the “original dragon” of legend. It can generate freezing air and energy, but it is said that the leaking of this energy caused it to freeze itself. No one has seen Kyurem’s whole form, though the group Team Plasma is said to have successfully fused either Reshiram or Zekrom with it.

It is regarded as the group’s most recent member—most historians date its acceptance into the group as some time shortly after the human war in which the original three members defended wild Pokémon. Keldeo can shoot water from its hooves to propel itself; it uses this technique to “run” across bodies of water and jump high distances. Because of its affinity for clean water, it is often seen near scenic lakefronts. Keldeo excels at using in its hind legs in attacks. According to legend, the veteran Swords of Justice adopted Keldeo as a protégé of sorts. Their leader, Cobalion, developed a particularly close bond with Keldeo. One day, Keldeo mysteriously ran away from the group to pursue its own path, becoming stronger than the other members. When they crossed paths again, Keldeo reaffirmed its place in the Swords of Justice; its former mentors taught him the move Secret Sword, which allowed it access newfound determination and enter its stronger Resolute Form.

However, as the world grew increasingly cynical and less appreciative of the arts, it began to lose its voice and its dance, symbolized in many folk songs and paintings by a pair of ruby-red shoes. Meloetta then seemed to largely disappear for a period of time. Musicians and singers began to play Meloetta’s signature melody, known as the Relic Song, to remind Meloetta wherever it was of the music it had once enchanted people with, allowing it to appear again. Today, artists play the Relic Song to attract Meloetta in hopes of being blessed with a stroke of ingenuity. Meloetta’s vocalization method can control the moods of those around it.

In addition to a new, metallic exoskeleton and upgraded firepower, Team Plasma also attached a modifiable cannon to Genesect’s back. Based on a number of different, interchangeable Drives that can be inserted into the cannon, the type of Genesect’s attack Techno Blast can be changed; its LED light also changes color to reflect this. By tucking in its limbs and its cannon, Genesect can fly like an aircraft. For a long time, virtually no one—including Team Plasma—knew of Genesect’s existence. This is because the organization’s then-perceived leader, “N”, decommissioned the project based on personal beliefs regarding genetic engineering.

The spines on top of a Chespin’s head are normally soft and pliable; when threatened, though, these Pokémon can quickly stiffen their quills so that their needle-like tips are sharp enough to pierce rocks. The coverings on their heads are made of wood, allowing them to withstand a headfirst collision with a truck without suffering any lasting damage. Chespin are cheerful and resilient Pokémon that are quick to regain their spirits even in the face of troubles and difficulties. In fact, they will often try their best to cheer up their friends—their trainers included—after lost battles and other similar events. Unsurprisingly, trainers in Kalos often choose Chespin for their uplifting optimism as well as their hardiness in battle.","﻿Evolves into Quilladin at Lvl 16Quilladin evolves into Chesnaught at Lvl 36","Research Notes","","Grass"," 1'04\" | 0.4 m"," 19.8 lbs | 9.0 kg"," "," ","

They never start conflicts with other Pokémon, even when resources are scarce. These Pokémon would rather starve than take food from another hungry creature. If attacked, Quilladin will defend themselves with their hard shells and sharp spines; however, they won’t attempt to counter-attack their aggressors. Quilladin shells are made of hard wood that can deflect the attacks of most enemies; their carapaces and sharp spines successfully deter most predators from even attempting to harm them. Quilladin live in small groups of about six or so individuals. Members of a group tend to be very close to one another. In their spare time, Quilladin will run into one another at high speeds in order to strengthen their lower bodies.

Chesnaught are extremely sturdy Pokémon—a tackle from one can overturn a 50-ton tank. By linking their arms in front of their faces, these Pokémon can fuse their forearms together to use Spiky Shield, a defensive technique that protects them from virtually any attack. They can easily withstand the explosion of a bomb in this manner. Chesnaught will not hesitate to use their bodies, which are shielded by spiked, wooden carapaces, to protect smaller and weaker Pokémon from attacks. In battle, they will defend their allies in this manner; there have even been many recorded cases of Chesnaught shielding their trainers from rockslides, explosions, and other dangers with their resilient bodies.

Despite their temperamental tendencies, however, these Pokémon always try their absolute best in battle and hate disappointing their trainers. Fennekin dispel excess heat through their ears, which can warm the air passing through them to over 390°F (200°C). These Pokémon have a curious diet—they subsist primarily on dry twigs, which they seek out constantly, even chewing on them while walking about. They combust the sticks they eat within their bodies to create fire. To intimidate foes, Fennekin will puff out hot air from their ears, causing the tufts of fur in them to glow faintly.

However, these Pokémon still demonstrate an affinity for twigs, keeping on in their tails at all times. These twigs appear to function as security blankets of sorts for Braixen, helping temper the mood swings they experienced as Fennekin. If a Braixen loses its stick, it will become fretful, anxious, and even angry. When Braixen pull their twigs out from their tails, the friction of the action ignites the tips of the sticks, giving them a makeshift torch. They use this burning stick to defend themselves from enemies. Braixen can wave the blazing branch in front of their mouths while breathing fire in order to increase the strength of their flames. Braixen will also use their twigs to communicate with others, which is useful considering these Pokémon are nocturnal.

When not in use, they store these sticks within the tufts of fur on their wrists. Delphox can stare at the fire at the tips of their branches to achieve a heightened state of focus and glance into the future. They can further focus their psychic energy on these flames to utilize the technique Mystical Fire or create flaming vortexes reaching 5,400°F (3,000°C), entrapping and incinerating foes within.

They can leap into action in the blink of an eye, spurred by warning signals most other people and Pokémon wouldn’t even notice. Froakie have strong hind legs that enable them to jump very high. Froakie breathe through their skin, which is rather thin and delicate. To protect themselves, they secrete a coat of bubbles (which many young trainers have dubbed “frubbles”) from their chests and backs. These bubbles are flexible and shock-absorbent, shielding Froakie from the brunt of most attacks. In addition, Froakie also use these bubbles to disguise themselves from attackers, enabling them to analyze their surroundings without being noticed.

The tips of their fingers and toes are specially adapted to allow them to attach and hang upside-down from ceilings and ascend vertical surfaces; additionally, these pads enable these Pokémon to run across the surface of water. Frogadier can climb 2,000 feet (610 meters) up a tower wall in just under 60 seconds. They often disguise themselves in cloaks of bubbles near the water’s surface as they patiently wait for prey. Frogadier are also skilled in ranged attacks; they are known to coat pebbles in bubbles before throwing to precisely hit targets up to 100 feet (30 meters) away.

Greninja are so swift that they sometimes seem to suddenly disappear and then reappear elsewhere as they move. Greninja will use this to their advantage, confusing foes with their speed before striking. The scarf-like appendages wrapped around the necks of these Pokémon are in fact their tongues. These tongues are prehensile, capable of being lashed like whips. Greninja can sometimes be found hanging upside-down from tree branches or ceilings in the shadows, waiting for unwary foes to approach. They can propel themselves considerable distances by shooting jets of water at the ground beneath them (though they can often jump just as high, if not higher).

These ears are strong enough to break through thick tree roots that happen to be in their way. Bunnelby are industrious Pokémon that can work for long periods of time, often spending entire nights digging without stopping to rest; they can dig up to 33 feet (10 meters) deep in a single night. They will sometimes dig superfluous tunnels around their burrows as practice to strengthen their ears. These destination-less tunnels also serve to confuse predators that enter their burrows. Particularly hardworking Bunnelby have been known to develop ears strong enough to pulverize stone. Bunnelby primarily feed on the roots of plants that they come across while digging; they will even eat through the hardier roots of trees, using their ears to break the tough roots up into more manageable pieces. Bunnelby also have very sensitive hearing, allowing them to detect predators like Talonflame and Corviknight approaching.

Additionally, these ears can reduce solid bedrock to rubble with successive blows. These features make Diggersby ideal candidates for workers in construction, demolition, and excavation sites. They are often seen alongside Gurdurr and Conkeldurr in urban construction zones, destroying old structures and boulders to make room for the other Pokémon to build. Though they are industrious workers, Diggersby also seem to know the value of leisure as well; they can often be seen lounging around on long breaks after finishing their duties.

Fletchling are diurnal and are most active in the early morning, when they can often be heard chirping amongst the trees. They communicate with one another with distinctive chirps and intricate movements of their tail-feathers. Their pretty voices, however, are a sharp contrast to their personalities—Fletchling are extremely territorial. They will relentlessly peck foes to drive them away and aren’t afraid to aim for the vulnerable areas of foes (most gruesomely, Fletchling often target the eyes). They are very friendly towards familiar faces, however. Fletchling can wield a select number of Fire-type techniques in battle, such as Flame Charge, but not nearly to the extent that their evolutions can. When excited or frightened, their body temperatures can double as aggressive hormones spike in their blood; this can be enough to cause mild burns in some cases, though trainers in warmer climates sometimes will train their Fletchling to warm to a more cozy temperature for cuddling purposes.","﻿Evolves into Fletchinder at Lvl 17Fletchinder evolves into Talonflame at Lvl 35","Research Notes","","Normal/Flying"," 1'00\" | 0.3 m"," 3.7 lbs | 1.7 kg"," "," ","

While hunting or fleeing, however, Fletchinder can exert energy to ignite these sacs and increase their flight speeds; this acceleration is not instant, though, as it takes time for their sacs to reach full blaze. Instead, Fletchinder will gradually speed up as their sacs grow hotter and hotter. Still, some Fletchinder can reach quite impressive speeds even before warming up. In battles, Fletchinder will often spend the first few moments playing defensively as they wait for their flame sacs to heat up before surprising their foes with swift assaults. To hunt, Fletchinder will let loose embers from their beaks that set the grass below on fire, scaring out creatures hiding within. Then, they swoop down to capture and roast the bewildered prey.

Consequently, however, these Pokémon have to hunt often in order to satiate their raging flames. Talonflame can reach the astonishing speed of 310 mph (500 km/h) while diving to the ground for prey. They also have strong talons and hind limbs, often using their feet to deliver powerful kicks as the killing blows to most prey. Talonflame can let loose showers of embers from the spaces between their feathers (they particularly seem to do so when stressed or excited, such as during intense battles), leaving behind trails of heated air as they soar around. They are aerial fighters that prefer to attack from the sky whenever possible; Talonflame will achieve a high velocity by dive-bombing opponents headfirst before swinging their lower bodies in front of them at the last second to deliver formidable kicks.

The key to the adaptive success of these Pokémon is the special black powder coating their bodies. This powder is incredibly effective at regulating ​heat, retaining it in cold weather but conducting it away in warmer climates, allowing Scatterbug to withstand a wide range of temperatures.

Spewpa conceal themselves within the shadows of thickets and bushes to avoid being disturbed as they wait for evolution. Flying-type Pokémon unaware of their defense mechanisms often try to attack them, though their beaks usually fail to pierce their sturdy bodies.

The intensity and temperature of light emanating from a Litleo’s mane is indicative of its emotions; the mane will burn hotter and brighter when it is angered or excited, but duller when it is ill or fatigued. Litleo manes tend to glow very bright when their owners are in heated battles as their bodies work to provide as much energy as possible. Young Litleo never stray from their prides, honing their skills by play-fighting with siblings or stalking prey that wander near. Older ones, though, are forced out of their prides to hunt for themselves; when evolved, they may return to their old prides, join separate ones, or, if male, start their own, provided that they can recruit a respectable numbers of females into them.

However, they try to avoid using flames to take down prey unless necessary, as they prefer their meat raw. The males of a Pyroar pride go out on hunts, led by the head male, to bring back food for all of the members. The females stay behind and guard the territory from intruders while caring for younger Litleo.

"669","Flabébé","669","Fields, gardens","Flabébé are some of the smallest and lightest Pokémon in existence. They dwell in fields of wildflowers and in the flowerbeds of gardens. The minute Flabébé are born, they search for a flower to hold onto. These Pokémon appear to be able to distinguish between many different species of similar flowers, and even the flowers of a single plant. When they find a flower they like, they will grasp onto it tightly and never let go of it for the rest of their lives. Flabébé both live in and care for their flowers; somehow, they are able to channel energy from the flowers they hold both to sustain themselves and to harness into attacks. In turn, Flabébé keep their flowers healthy and vibrant by providing them with the sunlight, water, and nutrients that they need. Their crowns are made of pollen, and are said to possess mystical healing properties. Flabébé can sometimes be seen floating carefreely in the breeze. They cannot survive without their flowers, though, as they are unable to obtain the energy they need to feed or fend for themselves alone. Similarly, their blooms (sometimes called “fairy flowers” after being chosen by Flabébé) cannot survive without their help.","Yellow","Research Notes","","Fairy"," 0'04\" | 0.1 m"," 0.2 lbs | 0.1 kg"," "," ","

"670","Floette","670","Fields, gardens","When Flabébé evolve into Floette, their flowers grow along with them. Like their pre-evolutions, Floette can be seen floating around flowerbeds and gardens. After evolving, these Pokémon become able to draw energy from all the blooms around them, not just the ones that they hold. In overgrown fields where flowers are allowed to grow freely, Floette are able to unleash surprisingly powerful attacks. While human urbanization has caused such areas to diminish, the construction of artificial gardens and flowerbeds have given Floette new places to dwell in. In return for the energy Floette pull out of flowers, they spend much of their time tending to nearby plants. They invest most of their energy into ensuring that all of the flowers around them bloom; when they come across a wilting flower, they will do everything in their power to restore its vibrancy. These Pokémon are popular in gardens for this reason, where they can be seen caring for planted flowers. It is said that Floette can draw the most strength from flowers that are the most beautiful.​ When a flowerbed blooms, the inhabiting Floette will perform an intricate, elegant dance to celebrate. These Pokémon will hold lifelong grudges against those that destroy their flowerbeds.","Yellow","Research Notes","","Fairy"," 0'08\" | 0.2 m"," 2.2 lbs | 0.9 kg"," "," ","

Florges are the guardians of beautiful, flower-filled meadows and gardens. They defend their delicate flowerbeds not only from other Pokémon, but also from natural disasters such as wildfires. They can live for centuries, dedicating their lives solely to single gardens. Florges spend much of their time tending to their beautiful flowerbeds. Like their pre-evolutions, these Pokémon draw power from blooms and can become very formidable in large, ornate gardens. Florges are so skilled in horticulture that many people request their help in designing gardens. Historical kings and governors have invited Florges to design intricate flowerbeds for their castles. In recent times, toxic industrial runoff from factories have become a problem for Florges populations, with the toxins leaching into nearby soils and preventing the flowers that these Pokémon and their pre-evolutions need for sustenance from growing. These Pokémon can summon powerful, yet hauntingly beautiful, storms of petals in order to protect themselves and their blooms.","Yellow","Research Notes","Fairy"," 3'07\" | 1.1 m"," 22.0 lbs | 10.0 kg"," Flower Veil |","Symbiosis","Symbiosis","

They are thought to be the first domesticated Pokémon domesticated by humans, even before the advent of Pokémon training—despite their small size, they are capable of carrying people, supplies, and other Pokémon on their backs for considerable distances. Their docile natures and sturdiness are both characteristics that likely made them prime candidates for early humans to domesticate. Additionally, Skiddo don’t require food; with ample water and sunlight, their leaves can photosynthesize enough energy to sustain them without draining the food stores of human farmers. Even today, many agricultural workers train Skiddo to carry around supplies; these Pokémon are also a common sight at petting zoos and fairs, where they give rides to people and Pokémon. Skiddo have lived alongside humans for so long that they have adapted to their presence; their horns are able to sense the thoughts and emotions of the riders holding them so they know where to go.","﻿Evolves into Gogoat at Lvl 32","Research Notes","","Grass"," 2'11\" | 0.9 m"," 68.3 lbs | 31.0 kg"," "," ","

Wild Gogoat can be found scaling rocky mountains, which their hooves are specially adapted to climb. They live in herds led by a single individual. These leaders are decided through a series of battles in which they clash horns with one another to establish dominance. These Pokémon tend to be docile and placid, particularly when around humans. Gogoat are far more commonly seen, however, on farms and pastures; some cities, such as Lumiose City, Kalos, also utilize Gogoat as a means of transportation. These Pokémon have adapted to working with humans; in addition to serving as “handlebars” for bipedal, two-handed riders, their horns can also sense the feelings and thoughts of those gripping onto them. This allows Gogoat to ferry people to their destinations without their riders needing to give any explicit instructions.","﻿Evolves from Skiddo at Lvl 32","Research Notes","Grass"," 5'07\" | 1.7 m"," 200.6 lbs | 91.0 kg"," Sap Sipper |","Grassy Pelt","Grassy Pelt","

"674","Pancham","674","Bamboo forests, mountains","Pancham are naturally found in bamboo forests, but they will also venture onto rocky mountains from time to time as well. These Pokémon often travel alone, or alongside Pangoro, and avoid seeking help from others. At a young age, Pancham will choose a Pangoro (usually not one of their parents) to apprentice under; they will strive to imitate this Pangoro's every move, learning how to battle and hunt. Pancham try their very hardest to appear threatening and intimidating to all of those around them; they will glare and bare their teeth when confronted to try to unnerve foes, but often end up looking adorable in the process. They may even smile if they lose focus for too long. When their intimidation tactics are not taken seriously, they will become even angrier, and thus even more endearing. Though they won’t openly admit it (and will feign anger after regaining composure), Pancham enjoy being patted on the head; this will cause them to loosen their “menacing” attitudes and break out into smiles. These mischievous Pokémon are virtually always seen chewing on bamboo leaves to look “cool.” These leaves act as pacifiers of sorts; they will become fretful when they cannot find leaves to chew on and may even break down into tears after extended periods of time. Pancham see older Pangoro as role models and strive to imitate them (without their help, of course). If a Pancham following a Pangoro makes a mistake, the Pangoro will take the Pancham's leaf as punishment, saddening it greatly.","Evolves into Pangoro at Lvl 32 when there is a Dark-type Pokémon in the party","Research Notes","","Fighting"," 2'00\" | 0.6 m"," 17.6 lbs | 8.0 kg"," "," ","

Though they can be very grumpy at times, Pangoro will not tolerate the bullying of smaller Pokémon; they will step in themselves to retaliate against offenders. Their sturdy bodies let them shrug off most direct attacks, while their bulky arms can snap telephone poles in two or send a dump truck flying. When enraged or defending others, Pangoro will enter states of rage, disregarding any injuries of their own to continue bashing down on foes. Their trainers must learn to calm them in these states. These somber Pokémon do not make much noise, instead preferring to send messages through brute force. Indeed, it is their stern attitudes that makes them popular amongst certain groups of trainers. They use the sprigs held in their mouths to detect air currents and sense where their opponents will go. Pangoro get especially passionate about dueling with rival Obstagoon. Unfortunately, their righteous natures have increasingly made them prime targets for fur trappers; by intentionally placing small Pokémon in peril near Pangoro, trappers are successfully able to trigger their berserk states and cause them to wander blindly into traps, a practice that many regions are working hard to curb.","Evolves from Pancham at Lvl 32 when there is a Dark-type Pokémon in the party","Research Notes","Fighting/Dark"," 6'11\" | 2.1 m"," 299.8 lbs | 136.0 kg"," Iron Fist | Mold Breaker |","Scrappy","Scrappy","

The voluminous quality of Furfrou fur also makes it easy to groom and style. In modern times, many upper-class trainers take their Furfrou to salons to get their fur trimmed and colored into a variety of ornate designs. The Pokémon themselves seem to enjoy the treatment; the trimming removes some of the heavy fur from their bodies and makes them more agile, though they will only allow trusted individuals to trim them. Additionally, Furfrou are often considered haughty Pokémon that take great pride in their physical appearances. It is only fitting that Furfrou were the standard Pokémon of kings in the Kalos region, where they served as the personal guard dogs of rulers. These Furfrou were often treated as royalty themselves, and were fed, bathed, and groomed by servants. This practice, in fact, is likely the root of modern Furfrou styling and grooming. Kalosian aristocrats would invent new fur stylings and compete to create most extravagant and intricate designs.","​Pokémon and all associated names and characters are trademarked and © 1995-2019 Nintendo. All non-original images are provided by Bulbapedia, © 1995-2019 Nintendo.No copyright infringement intended.","Research Notes","Normal"," 3'11\" | 1.2 m"," 61.7 lbs | 28.0 kg"," Fur Coat"," Field"," Field","

For this reason, they tend to inhabit abandoned human settlements or the tall grass of fields, where they can remain hidden. These Pokémon are rather quiet and unassuming, saving for their unnerving glares; however, their ears disguise two eye-like psychic organs that can potentially unleash enough energy to obliterate everything around them in a radius of 300 feet (100 meters). Espurr cannot control this power, which is automatically let loose when they raise their ears. Many believe that Espurr are in fact afraid of their own abilities, which is why they live as far away as possible from other forms of life. When frightened, though, Espurr may raise their ears in shock, with devastating results. Many unsubstantiated urban legends have emerged revolving around Espurr, the most prevalent of which entails that staring into their unblinking eyes will allow them to steal one’s soul (which, as of yet, is an unproven claim).","﻿Evolves into Meowstic at Lvl 25","","Research Notes","","Psychic"," 1'00\" | 0.3 m"," Keen Eye | Own Tempo |"," Keen Eye | Own Tempo |","

Upon evolution from Espurr, Meowstic gain full control over their eye-like psychic organs. By unfolding their ears, they can unveil these organs and unleash enough energy to pulverize a 10-ton truck into dust. Meowstic must keep a close eye on their ears and keep them sealed as tight as possible, as even a slight relaxation can allow a significant amount of energy to leak out. Though they have better control of their powers, Meowstic still tend to avoid contact with others in fear of causing unnecessary harm. Their fingertips actually conceal sharp claws. These Pokémon mate for life; females venture out in search for food while males stay behind to care for the young—a notable inversion of traditional gender roles amongst Pokémon, but fitting based upon their varying battle styles.

This belief also explains why these Pokémon are often found near the ruins of medieval castles, as they are still protecting their old kingdoms. Usually, Honedge remain in their sheathes to prevent their blades from becoming worn and rusted. When attacking, however, they will unsheathe themselves to reveal their sharpened blades, holding their sheathes in their tassels. A slash from a Honedge is believed to not only injure a being physically, but also damage its soul as well. Honedge feed on life energy by wrapping their tassels around a being’s appendage and draining its life force through its cloth; it will feed until its victim is left soulless. In fact, it is believed that the tassels are in fact their true bodies, merely wielding the swords as weapons. A famous Kalos legend involves an opportunistic thief finding and taking a sword on the side of the road, only to find out that it was actually a life-draining Honedge; the tale is intended to teach children to not take what isn’t theirs.","﻿Evolves into Doublade at Lvl 35Doublade evolves into Aegislash with a Dusk Stone","Steel/Ghost"," 2'07\" | 0.8 m"," 4.4 lbs | 2.0 kg"," No Guard"," Mineral","Habitat","Habitat","

These Pokémon can alternate nimbly between offense and defense to keep opponents on their toes. They will rub their blades together prior to combat in order to unnerve foes with a scraping metallic sound. Like Honedge, Doublade feed by draining the life energy of beings by gripping their limbs with their tassels. The two blades cannot stray far from each other; for an unknown reason, if they are too far away from their plaque, they will fall to the ground as lifeless swords that can only be reanimated if they are somehow re-sheathed. There have been recorded incidents in which each sword of a Doublade had latched onto different beings within the same vicinity, or even both grabbed onto different limbs of the same unfortunate victim. If grabbed by a Doublade, one should run as far away as possible from the plaque, as the blades will not risk losing their own spirits by straying too far.","﻿Evolves from Honedge at Lvl 35​Evolves into Aegislash with a Dusk Stone","Research Notes","","Steel/Ghost"," 2'07\" | 0.8 m"," 9.9 lbs | 4.5 kg"," Mineral"," Mineral","

In numerous historical accounts of these Pokémon (who are fortunately very rare in the wild), many of the people they chose to possess became kings and other royal officials later on in life with an astonishing probability. These stories often end with the Aegislash being their own undoing, becoming too greedy and draining their wielders of too much life force, leading to the collapses of the kingdoms they helped create. Some believe that Aegislash controlled entire lineages of royalty, from their crownings to their deposals, a seemingly ludicrous proposition until one considers the numerous depictions of these Pokémon alongside their so-called “masters” in medieval artwork. Trained Aegislash seem to only respect trainers who display signs of leadership themselves.

Spritzee also sometimes venture out into open meadows or even rural human settlements if food is plentiful in those areas. They are famous for being able to emit a wide variety of smells based on their diet, storing aromatic compounds in special scent pouches. These can range from pleasant floral scents to disgusting rotten odors. They are thought to use these tantalizing smells to attract insect prey. Spritzee scents were once used as natural perfumes; popular amongst women, fragrance connoisseurs raised Spritzee on specific diets to create particular scents. Royal women carried Spritzee around to give themselves unique aromas. This practice has recently returned into vogue, with more humane policies, as a way to imitate traditional royalty.","Evolves into Aromatisse through trade with a Satchet","Fairy"," 0'04\" | 0.2 m"," 1.1 lbs | 0.5 kg"," Healer |"," "," Fairy"," Fairy","

These Pokémon then mix particular substances to create scents; each individual Aromatisse has its own unique aroma that is used to identify it amongst its peers. This smell can be overpowering to those with sensitive noses—even trainers of Aromatisse may have difficulty dealing with their strong smells, and companions of these Pokémon may find their olfactory senses dulled over time. Aromatisse devise new scents by mixing different substances, with varying results. In battle, these Pokémon emit a number of differing odors to see which one their opponents despise the most before attempting to overwhelm their senses by unleashing a saturated cloud of that aroma.

In fact, they consume so much sugar--up to their own body weights each day--that their bodies have to excrete the excess into their fur as syrupy white strands that renders them always sticky. These Pokémon shed their sugary fur relatively often in small clumps held together by this syrup-like substance. Young children often enjoy picking up and eating the clumps left behind by Swirlix as sugary treats known as “Swirly Floss” (the incredibly high sugar content of the syrup coating the already-sugary fur keeps the clumps free of microbes). Swirlix will also spit out these syrupy strands to entangle and slow predators. Swirlix are able to draw their feet into the fur of their bodies. These Pokémon used to primarily live in woodlands and meadows, where they would feed on fruits, flower nectar, and occasionally Combee honey. In modern times, however, the introduction of mass-produced candy has caused these Pokémon to migrate to urban areas in record numbers.

Slurpuff also have the ability to adjust the sensitivities of various olfactory receptors so that they won’t be overwhelmed by strong scents. When their sharp senses of smell were first discovered, there was much clamor amongst the public to introduce them into sectors like firefighting (to detect smoke even before smoke detectors) or forensics (to track down criminals—though they were not very good at chasing them, which is why Growlithe remain the standard choice). However, Slurpuff are today most often seen with chefs helping bake (and eat) pastries, where both their senses of smell can be utilized and their sweet teeth be satisfied.

These unassuming Pokémon seem to be rather defenseless at first, making them common targets for inexperienced predators. However, Inkay hold a surprising ability that allows them to escape predation the vast majority of the time; the spots on their mantles can flash with lights, allowing Inkay to influence the minds of all that gaze into them. Though they cannot yet fully manipulate people or other Pokémon, they can sufficiently influence them enough to drain their will to fight. Inkay use this technique to hunt immobile prey with ease by luring them in with lights and then grasping them with their tentacles; they will also use their lights to escape from confused predators. It is believed that Inkay will flash their lights in complex patterns to communicate with one another across distances.

This motion requires two individuals to work together in unison, which is likely why Binacle live in pairs. Still, cooperation is imperative for both attacking and defending, and bickering Binacle are unlikely to survive for long. These creatures attach themselves to rocks by excreting a special cement that glues them to stones; even the strongest forces cannot pull them off once attached. When threatened, Binacle contract themselves and hide the vulnerable portions of their bodies, exposing only their bare heads and sharp claws. Binacle are capable of removing themselves from rocks by excreting an enzyme that dissolves the cement holding them, allowing them to inch away to find other stones; they are known to do this when bickering with their partners (though extracting themselves does leave them completely exposed until they can find new rocks).

Individual Barbaracle have been known to “secede” from their bodies (by dissolving the cement binding them to their rocks), however, if they disagree with the orders they are given. While the individuals serving as the arms and legs of a Barbaracle have rather obvious purposes, the two units on the shoulders possess less clear jobs. They are known as the “scout” individuals, who use their eyes to help Barbaracle scan the entire area around them (though all eyes of a Barbaracle are fully functional, the scouts are entirely dedicated to keeping watch).

Skrelp do not need to be agile, however, because they spend their time camouflaging themselves in kelp forests, where they are virtually indistinguishable from the seaweed thanks to the growths on their bodies that resemble rotting kelp. In these forests, Skrelp patiently wait for unwary prey seeking shelter within the kelp to swim by before spraying them with liquid poison and consuming them; the bulk of their diets, however, is the very rotting kelp that they hide in. These Pokémon try to move as little as possible in order to conserve energy for evolution and avoid predation. In some regions, dried Skrelp is thought to have powerful medicinal properties. People of these areas consume Skrelp powder in minute quantities, as even half an ounce more than the standard dosage can be fatally poisonous.

These Pokémon are most famous for their specialized right claws, which are much larger than their left ones. These claws can fire compressed shots of water much like pistols by expelling pressurized internal gas from within these Pokémon’s bodies. At close range, a single shot from a Clauncher claw can pulverize stone. These shots can travel surprisingly far, though they lose speed and force exponentially as they travel. Clauncher use these claws to hunt prey and defend themselves from enemies, shooting bullets of water at foes from a distance. They also use them to jet themselves through the water in quick bursts. The lighting-quick mechanism Clauncher use to fire water, which is too fast to be seen by the human eye, also creates a cavitation bubble that collapses to make a booming sound that is loud enough to deafen or even paralyze those that are too close. This sound is currently one of the loudest naturally-produced noises known in the entire ocean. These claws can occasionally fall off, leaving Clauncher temporarily defenseless; their meat is notoriously delicious and is considered a delicacy in many regions. Humorously, they also make Clauncher terrible, unbalanced swimmers, which is likely why they prefer to scuttle or jet along the reef floor.","﻿Evolves into Clawitzer at Lvl 37","Research Notes","","Water"," 1'08\" | 0.5 m"," 18.3 lbs | 8.3 kg"," Water 1 | Water 3"," Water 1 | Water 3","

"693","Clawitzer","693","Coral reefs, sea floors","When Clauncher evolve into Clawitzer, their launching claws develop greatly while the rest of their bodies remain mostly unchanged. The right claws of these Pokémon, through the expulsion of highly pressurized gas, can launch large cannonballs of water at high speeds through great distances. Such shots are able to pierce directly through the hulls of tankers even when relatively far away. Additionally, these claws can expel water from specialized nozzles on their rears to propel Clawitzer forwards at 60 knots (70 mph, or 111 km/h). The collapse of the cavitation bubbles these creatures produce when firing water can let loose bright flashes of light incredibly loud booming sounds. Even if Clawitzer miss their prey when hunting (which they often do because of the unwieldy nature of their huge claws), the deafening noise and blinding light they produce often stuns victims long enough to allow them to try again with second shots. The antennae on a Clawitzer’s launching claw can sense changes in water currents to help it detect prey. As with Clauncher, their primary claws fall off occasionally and are prized as a luxury ingredient in high-end restaurants.","﻿Evolves from Clauncher at Lvl 37","Water"," 4'03\" | 1.3 m"," 77.8 lbs | 35.3 kg"," Mega Launcher"," Water 1 | Water 3","Habitat","Habitat","

"694","Helioptile","694","Deserts","Helioptile make their homes in hot, flat deserts where there are few trees to block out the sunlight. These Pokémon are adapted to the sweltering, dry conditions of deserts and can survive for long periods of time without drinking water. The flaps on either side of their heads help dissipate excess heat; they can also unfold into flat frills, which, thanks to their black coloration, can absorb sunlight very efficiently. Helioptile convert the sunlight absorbed by their frills into electrical energy, which they can use to sustain themselves in lieu of food. They can also use this energy to defend themselves from predators by stunning them with electric shocks. Interrupting sunbathing Helioptile stresses them out greatly, leave them weak and defenseless against predators. The triangular tips of their frills light up when launching electrical attacks. On cloudy days, Helioptile will hide themselves and lie dormant in order to conserve as much energy as possible until the sun comes out again. Today, modern solar panel technology is based largely upon extended scientific research on the abilities of Helioptile and their evolutions, Heliolisk, to take advantage of the photoelectric effect.","﻿Evolves into Heliolisk with a Sun Stone","Electric/Normal"," 1'08\" | 0.5 m"," 13.2 lbs | 6.0 kg"," Dry Skin | Sand Veil |"," Solar Power"," Monster | Dragon"," Monster | Dragon","

"695","Heliolisk","695","Deserts","The small orange frills surrounding a Heliolisk’s neck are in fact part of a much larger black collar which can unfold into a light-absorbing disk around the Pokémon’s head. The greater area of a Heliolisk’s frills allow it to create electricity through the photoelectric effect much more efficiently than Helioptile; when fully charged, a single Heliolisk can provide enough electricity to power the lights of an entire skyscraper. Heliolisk also use electricity to stimulate their own muscles. They can cover 100 yards (91 meters) in merely five seconds and even run across the surface of water for a brief period of time using the extra strength provided by jolts of electricity. However, they must recharge after such energy-demanding tasks. Heliolisk spend much of their time standing still with their frills unfolded in the sun to gather energy. When they attack, the tips of their frills will glow brightly. During mating season, these diurnal Pokémon will unfold and light up their frills to attract mates. Individuals with the largest frills are deemed the most attractive. An ancient desert culture once praised Heliolisk, believing them to be mystical and connected to a deity they worshipped. When this culture's ruins were excavated by Galarian archaeologists, a number of Heliolisk snuck onboard with the unearthed artifacts and made it to Galar, establishing the population that exists there today.","﻿Evolves from Helioptile with a Sun Stone","Electric/Normal"," 3'03\" | 1.0 m"," 46.3 lbs | 21.0 kg"," Dry Skin | Sand Veil |"," Solar Power"," Monster | Dragon"," Monster | Dragon","

Today, they can be resurrected from excavated Jaw Fossils. Tyrunt have extremely powerful jawbones that can crunch with enough pressure to flatten automobile parts. These strong bones make their heads very heavy, so it is very difficult for Tyrunt to stand upright; consequently, they often hold their heads very close to the ground. Tyrunt are extremely finicky Pokémon; they will throw wild tantrums when they are displeased by something. Trainers of Tyrunt often report that their Pokémon will enter property-destroying fits of anger after slights as minor as being served a food that they dislike. Commonly characterized as spoiled, they do not play well with others and often hurt smaller Pokémon when roughhousing. Tyrunt also despise doing practically anything on their own; in the wild, Tyrunt were cared for entirely by their parents, who would bring them food, bathe them, and even lull them to sleep. Consequently, orphaned Tyrunt rarely survived for long without their parents. Some scientists believed that Tyrunt looked quite different in the past compared to how they look when resurrected from Jaw Fossils; a few even postulate that these Pokémon were entirely feathered instead of simply collared with feathers.","﻿Evolves into Tyrantrum at Lvl 39 during the day","Rock/Dragon"," 2'07\" | 0.8 m"," 57.3 lbs | 26.0 kg"," Strong Jaw |"," "," Monster | Dragon"," Monster | Dragon","

Their incredibly strong jaws can crush through solid metal like paper, and their vicious brutality made them a feared force amongst other prehistoric Pokémon. As the top of the food chain, Tyrantrum had little to worry about other than finding food and were believed to essentially rule ancient jungles like kings—they ate anything and travelled anywhere thy wanted to. Tyrantrum, however, often ended up being controlled a certain other species of Pokémon—their own offspring Tyrunt. Greatly protective of their young, Tyrantrum would go to great lengths in order to please their incredibly picky children. Scientists are baffled as to how these dominating predators could have gone extinct; most hypothesize some sort of external event outside of their control, such as an massive asteroid impact or a freezing ice age, as a possible reason for their extinction. The scientific world has not yet reached a consensus on a single convincing explanation, however. Some scientists believed that the Tyrantrum of ancient times were fully covered in feathers, and the feather collar that modern revived Tyrantrum possess is merely what can be salvaged by modern technology.","﻿Evolves from Tyrunt at Lvl 39 during the day","Rock/Dragon"," 8'02\" | 2.5 m"," 595.2 lbs | 270.0 kg"," Strong Jaw |"," "," Monster | Dragon"," Monster | Dragon","

"698","Amaura","698","Prehistoric glaciers and tundras","Alive approximately 100 million years ago, Amaura can be revived from ancient Sail Fossils, though they have also been successfully resurrected from frozen tissue preserved in glaciers. Amaura were unique amongst most prehistoric Pokémon in that they lived in freezing, icy tundras rather than warm jungles or seas. In these areas, they did not face predation from carnivores like Tyrantrum. The crystals on either side of their bodies emanate freezing cold air that allow them to freeze water in the atmosphere to use Ice-type attacks. They can create effects similar to that of magnetic auroras by suspending tiny ice crystals in the air, though it should be noted that the two phenomena are unrelated. Still, some believe that an aurora appears in the sky whenever an Amaura whinnies. Scientists once believed that Amaura were able to survive low temperatures by being warm-blooded, but recent research has revealed that their blood contains antifreeze proteins. Though Amaura were able to survive the ice age that wiped out most of their contemporaries, they likely went extinct in the following warming period; for this reason, they can be difficult to raise in modern conditions except in the iciest environments, as the modern world is much warmer than that of the ice age.","﻿Evolves into Aurorus at Lvl 39 during the night","Research Notes","","Rock/Ice"," 4'03\" | 1.3 m"," 55.6 lbs | 25.2 kg"," "," ","

"699","Aurorus","699","Prehistoric glaciers and tundras","Aurorus are large, slow Pokémon that once inhabited frozen tundras. Because of their harsh environments, they did not have to fear most predators, who could not survive the cold; Aurorus have antifreeze proteins in their blood that enable them to endure freezing temperatures. The crystals on these Pokémon chill the surrounding air to temperatures as low as -240°F (-150°C), allowing them to instantly freezing moisture in the air. Aurorus use this ability to form blocks of ice in front of them and block incoming attacks; when threatened, they may also try to encase their foes in ice. These Pokémon can also create aurora-like lights by diffracting light through tiny ice crystals in the air. Because Aurorus relied primarily on the bitter cold to keep predators away from them, they likely went extinct during an ancient warming period in which much of the world’s ice melted. Such an event allowed many predators, who saw the large, yet slow and relatively defensive Aurorus as easy prey, to venture further north into once-icy regions. Scientists have recently discovered a fully-intact Aurorus frozen in a northern glacier; it is believed that the Aurorus froze itself to protect itself from some sort of danger, though the nature of this threat is unknown.","﻿Evolves from Amaura at Lvl 39 during the night","Rock/Ice"," 8'010\" | 2.7 m"," 496.0 lbs | 225.0 kg"," Refrigerate |"," "," Monster"," Monster","

These Pokémon are almost always found alongside humans, though there have been some reports of particularly playful wild Eevee evolving into Sylveon as well. Sylveon dislike conflicts and will attempt to avoid them whenever possible. In fact, the sight of their ribbonlike feelers waving in the air seems to placate many fighters. These feelers are able to sense the emotions of the living things that they touch. When not in battle, Sylveon have a habit of wrapping their feelers around their trainers’ arms as if holding hands. By doing so, they can sense every emotion that their trainers feel. Sylveon can use the powerful Fairy-type move Moonblast in battle. Elusive wild Sylveon dwell in lush woodlands, where they are surrounded by life and can easily avoid hostility. Despite having no prior contact with people, these wild individuals seem to prefer the company of humans to other beings. In battle, they may use their feelers to placate foes before attacking. They seem to be able to sense when they have the upper hand in battle, and will charge headfirst into situations that they feel they can win easily.

Though small and relatively frail, the dexterity of these Pokémon allow them to stay on par with the likes of heavier Pokémon such as Machamp and Hariyama in battle. Hawlucha cannot truly fly; rather, they jump into the air or leap from high places and use their wings to soar on wind currents. They can deftly switch between different drafts to stay in the air for long periods of time. Hawlucha prefer to attack foes from above, diving below to strike when opponents show an opening in a technique known as Flying Press. Their style of fighting is thought to be very elegant, with an emphasis on well-executed submission holds. In fact, Hawlucha take great pride in the grace of their attacks and will often perform twirls and spins in the air simply for show. They will always strike a pose before delivering finishing blows. Sometimes, they will accidentally spend so much time on performing that they end up giving opponents an opening, much to their embarrassment. Because of the artistic style of their fighting, many people enjoy watching Hawlucha battle; many television shows dedicated to watching Hawlucha (or people imitating them) duel each other and show off their techniques have proved to be very successful. ​","​Pokémon and all associated names and characters are trademarked and © 1995-2019 Nintendo. All non-original images are provided by Bulbapedia, © 1995-2019 Nintendo.No copyright infringement intended.","Fighting/Flying"," 2'07\" | 0.8 m"," 47.4 lbs | 21.5 kg"," Unburden | Limber |"," "," Flying | Human-Like"," Flying | Human-Like","

These Pokémon drain electricity from wall sockets by sticking their tails into them; they sometimes become household pests, as a small family of Dedenne living in and draining the electricity of a home can quickly cause electricity bills to skyrocket. They also can be problems near power plants for this reason. Dedenne can fire bolts of electricity from their lower antennae-shaped whiskers; their upper ones simply detect changes in air and electric currents around them. These whiskers are also capable of sending radio waves, allowing Dedenne to communicate with each other over vast distances. Radios sometimes experience interference when these Pokémon are in the area; to combat this, towers may send out “dummy” radio waves to interfere with Dedenne communication and ward them away. Despite the numerous problems Dedenne can cause, however, they make for popular pets because of their cuteness and relative ease of care, as they can subsist entirely on electricity from wall sockets.","​Pokémon and all associated names and characters are trademarked and © 1995-2019 Nintendo. All non-original images are provided by Bulbapedia, © 1995-2019 Nintendo.No copyright infringement intended.","Electric/Fairy"," 0'08\" | 0.2 m"," 4.9 lbs | 2.2 kg"," Cheek Pouch | Pickup |"," "," Field | Fairy"," Field | Fairy","

They are rarely seen in the open because of their seclusion and are rumored to have been born out of the immense heat and pressure of the underground (though they are not very rare in caves). Intense pressure has made them incredibly hard; some of the carbon within their bodies has even been compressed into diamond as a result. They can fire beams of energy from their gems. Carbink are most commonly seen above-ground when accidentally uncovered during construction projects or cave excavations, having been lying dormant. They are popular Pokémon for their beautiful gemstones, which are usually spotless; groups of them will rub their soft manes on one another to polish each other's gems.

These Pokémon have no bones, chitin, or other hard tissues within their mostly-aquatic bodies whatsoever, allowing them to contort themselves and squeeze through tight spaces. Goomy are often considered the weakest of all Dragon-type Pokémon because of their paltry attacks and soft torsos. However, they are far from defenseless; their gooey bodies are covered in slick films of special mucus that cause physical attacks to slide off of them harmlessly. It also possesses a moderate paralyzing agent that will stun those that try to grab them. This mucus also helps keep these Pokémon hydrated outside of wet environments, though they can only keep the Pokémon protected temporarily; Goomy must spend most of their time resting in damp, shady areas in order to keep their slimy bodies from drying out, as they breathe through their skin. Despite these protections, Goomy are still timid creatures that will hide as soon as their horns sense danger. These horns are very sensitive to changes in air flow and humidity, allowing them to detect the precense of others from afar. Because of their cute appearances, Goomy are popular amongst trainers of all ages. They serve as the mascots of companies, universities, fan clubs. The protection of Goomy habitats was the main motivation behind the declaration of Kalos Route 14 as a nature preserve.","﻿Evolves into Sliggoo at Lvl 40Sliggoo evolves into Goodra at Lvl 50 in the rain","Dragon"," 1'00\" | 0.3 m"," 6.2 lbs | 2.8 kg"," Sap Sipper | Hydration |"," "," Dragon"," Dragon","

Instead of sight, Sliggoo use their four horns to detect both sound and smell; these senses are highly  developed to compensate for their lack of vision. To protect themselves, Sliggoo will excrete a sticky yet highly corrosive liquid onto foes (consisting of digestive fluids mixed with mucoid glycoproteins). They slurp of the dissolved remains of prey, as they are toothless. They seem to have trouble distinguishing friend from food, however. Their humps resemble shells, but in fact hold their coiled digestive tracts as well as their small brains.

However, the slimy mucus covering their bodies, which drips off of them as they travel, can keep them hydrated for long periods of time. Goodra are friendly, though shy and a bit slow-witted. They display their affection by hugging their friends or trainers. This leaves their loved ones covered in a sticky, unfortunately cloth-staining, slime. They will cry gooey tears when lonely. Despite their amiability, however, Goodra can attack powerfully in battle. They use their stretchy horns to launch devastating punches with strength a hundred times greater than that of a pro boxer. They can also coat their foes in sticky mucus to slow down their movement and whip them with their strong tails. The combination of slime and a thick layer of fat beneath their skin allows Goodra to shake off direct hits easily.

Some scientists believe that they used to live primarily in mines before humans developed metalworking. These Pokémon spend their lives simply collecting keys; no one knows what purpose this serves them as a species. Regardless, Klefki will float around human settlements in search of keys. When they find ones they like, they will unhook their loops and add them to their collections before resealing their loops again. They will protect their keys with their lives, only releasing them to trusted allies and trainers. For this reason, some businesses train Klefki to protect valuable keys to safes and vaults. These Pokémon jingle their keys as a warning signal to foes, though this technique seems to be rather ineffective at warding off aggressors. They can wield a number of status-inflicting enchantments rather well, however.

In addition to providing shelter for a number of different Pokémon, they are also capable of manipulating trees by extending their nerve-containing roots underground to attach to other roots like makeshift “nervous” systems of sorts. This ability allows Trevenant to protect their forests from attackers, shifting trees to block entrances and exits. If someone attempts to harm their forests, Trevenant will punish them by cursing and trapping them in the woods for all of eternity, unable to escape the moving trees. It is said that people trapped in this manner eventually turn into Phantump or Trevenant themselves (or are devoured, according to some myths). Trevenant dislike light and despise fire, however, so lumberjacks will bring along Fire-type Pokémon as a safety precaution.

The Pokémon Dusknoir are believed to pick these spirits up here to ferry them into the world of the dead while Pumpkaboo remain behind. The lights on these Pokémon’s bodies are thought to show lost spirits the path to the spirit world; for this reason, living travelers who encounter these lights try to avoid them whenever possible.

Villagers were not to open doors to anyone; it was believed that Gourgeist would go knocking from house to house and would spirit away anyone who answered. As a ritual to keep them at bay, townspeople would light candles inside gourds resembling Gourgeist and place them in front of their houses in hopes that the lights would make their streets too bright for them to travel (as they are only active during the new moon). This tradition still carries on today in some areas, though people now know that the singing of these Pokémon doesn’t actually curse listeners.

Bergmite greatly dislike temperatures above freezing and never venture anywhere not covered in snow or ice; unlike their evolutions Avalugg, their bodies cannot withstand heat for extended periods of time. This is why they often cluster on top of their parents, as the bodies of Avalugg radiate freezing air that keep their children comfortable. To defend themselves, Bergmite expel chilling air of temperatures as low as -150ºF (-100ºC) to freeze foes solid. They cover their bodies with sharp spikes of ice by freezing moisture in the air to shield themselves from attacks. Bergmite never allow their true bodies to show through the ice covering them.

"714","Noibat","714","Caves, forests","Noibat can be found in dark caves where little to no light penetrates. Because vision is largely useless in these areas, Noibat have adapted to navigate their surroundings through echolocation. They can produce ultrasonic pitches as high as 200,000 Hertz, far higher than human ears can perceive.  Unlike other Pokémon that use echolocation, however, Noibat don’t create these sound waves from their mouths; instead, the organs that both produce and receive sonic waves are located in their large ears. The pitches that Noibat use for echolocation can be disorienting even to people and Pokémon that do not consciously hear them; pro-wrestlers trained to maintain their balance can become dizzy when near these Pokémon. People traveling in Noibat caves often become lost because of the disorienting sounds. Noibat use this ability when threatened to confuse foes and escape. Prolonged exposure to the frequencies at which Noibat echolocate can damage a person’s hearing. Noibat trainers are advised to wear special headphones that block out such frequencies.

"715","Noivern","715","Caves, forests","Noivern spend the day sleeping in dark caves. At night, particularly on those of new moons, they venture out into forests in search of prey. Noivern use their echolocation to locate and ambush unsuspecting victims. They emit ultrasonic sound waves from their ears to disorient prey before they swoop in. These Pokémon are omnivores, however, and enjoy eating many different kinds of fruits and berries—they seem to have a particular affinity for Persim Berries. They can create sonic waves powerful enough to shatter boulders. Noivern tend to be aggressive Pokémon that will indiscriminately attack those who enter their territories. They are even known to be cruel, tormenting small Pokémon lost in the dark for pleasure. A peace offering of fruit, however, will often be enough to calm hostile Noivern down. In battle, Noivern can utilize many sound-based attacks to bring down foes, such as the dizzying Supersonic and the powerful Boomburst. They communicate warnings to other Noivern about territorial boundaries using sonar; those unfortunate enough to be caught between two conflicting Noivern may sometimes faint from dizziness.","﻿Evolves from Noibat at Lvl 48","","Research Notes","","Flying/Dragon"," 4'11\" | 1.5 m"," Frisk | Infiltrator |"," Frisk | Infiltrator |","

"716","Xerneas","716","Woodlands","Xerneas holds the power of life in its control. According to legend, it has the ability to grant immortality to those who find it; many Kalos legends involve people on quests attempting (and failing) to locate this mythical Pokémon. It is thought to be able to sprout thriving forests and revive the dead with its powers. Xerneas has the ability to transform into a giant tree and lie dormant for a thousand years, releasing its life energy throughout the world in the process; its reawakening is said to represent rebirth. Even when awake, Xerneas usually remains in its blue Neutral Mode. When using its abilities, however, its seven-colored horns and striped body will glow radiantly. Though Xerneas is the Pokémon of life, it should be noted that in Kalos mythology, life is not strictly “good;” rather, it is only half of one of the world’s integral processes. The tragic story of the immortal AZ, doomed to wander the earth forever, is often cited as an example of the consequences of eternal life. In the same way, people should desire that Xerneas and Yveltal remain in balance.","Also see Yveltal","Fairy"," 9'10\" | 3.0 m"," 474.0 lbs | 215.0 kg"," Fairy Aura"," Undiscovered","Habitat","Habitat","

For this reason, it is believed to inhabit desolate wastelands—areas that were once lush with life until it arrived. This Pokémon is said to only awaken every thousand years, lying dormant in a cocoon for centuries. According to legends, Yveltal’s awakening brings barrenness to fields, desiccation to rivers, and famine to villages. Right before it transforms into a cocoon to slumber, it will absorb the life energy of everything around it, as well as some of the whole world’s, one fintal time.  While Yveltal ushers in death and destruction, however, the culture of the Kalos region does not treat it as monstrosity. According to Kalos mythology, life and death are a necessary cycle of the world that must remain in balance; when Xerneas creates vibrant, thriving life, Yveltal must also take life away to keep the world in order. Though many people of Kalos do not desire death, they do not wish to remain alive for all of eternity, either.","Also see Xerneas","Dark/Flying"," 19'00\" | 5.8 m"," 447.5 lbs | 203.0 kg"," Dark Aura"," Undiscovered","Habitat","Habitat","

The first is when Xerneas awakens without Yveltal and causes the world to be overpopulated with life; the other is when Yveltal awakens without Xerneas and destroys much of the world. In either case, Zygarde will use its powers to force the offending Pokémon back into its slumber to restore order. Some people warn of a third situation that would awaken Zygarde—human activity disturbing the natural balance. Zygarde is made up of many Cells controlled by Cores; these Cores each have minds of their own and will gather Cells to help them deal with crises. 10% of the Cells combine to form its speedy, close combat-oriented 10% Forme; half of them combine for its serpentine 50% Forme, said to act as a sentinel watching over the environment; all of them combine for its powerful Complete Forme, said to possess the power to neutralize any threat to the world's balance.","10% Forme","Dragon/Ground"," 16'05\" | 5.0 m"," 672.4 lbs | 305.0 kg"," Aura Break (10% and 50% Formes) | Power Construct (All Formes)"," Undiscovered","Habitat","Habitat","

Diancie’s diamonds are said to have impeccable clarity and color and are thought to be the most beautiful jewels in the world. For this reason, the Diamond Domain has long been a fabled location for treasure hunters to pursue in hopes of great wealth. These diamonds are also believed to prevent illness and misfortune for those who hold or wear them. Diancie oversees the legendary Diamond Domain and makes sure that it always remains hidden from those who intended to loot it or steal from it.

Long ago, an ancient desert civilization was said to have sealed Hoopa’s true power away in an artifact known as the Prison Bottle. Opening the bottle would restore its strength for a short time; in this form, known as Unbound Hoopa, it becomes a monstrous, six-handed beast that would be able to transport anything between dimensions. Legends say that this gigantic creature once carried an entire castle of gold along with it through a hyperspace hole because of its greed.

However, this Pokémon is also said to dislike humans, cloaking its domain in thick fog to deter travelers from approaching. The large ring on its body can actually detach and rotate to form two large cannons. Volcanion can fire superheated steam from these cannons with incredible force. It is thought to gather water from mountain lakes and streams for this purpose, storing it within its large hump; it then quickly heats it to rapidly produce steam. The dots on its cannons are thought to be indicative of how much water Volcanion has left, dimming and then turning red once it has completely run out. Some people believe that this Pokémon may dislike humans because it was alive to witness the horrible destruction that the great war of Kalos left behind 3,000 years ago.","​Pokémon and all associated names and characters are trademarked and © 1995-2019 Nintendo. All non-original images are provided by Bulbapedia, © 1995-2019 Nintendo.No copyright infringement intended.","Fire/Water"," 5'07\" | 1.7 m"," 429.9 lbs | 195.0 kg"," Water Absorb"," Undiscovered","Habitat","Habitat","

Rowlet spend the day resting in the treetops, gathering energy from sunlight through photosynthesis as they sleep. When night falls, they take flight. Rowlet stalk prey from above without making a single sound, carefully positioning themselves before diving down and ambushing their prey with a pummeling of fast kicks with their sharp talons. They can also use the move Leafage to fire their sharp, feather-like leaves from their wings like arrows and impale victims. Rowlet have an odd habit of turning their heads around fully to watch their trainers intently during battles. They are calmed by dark, tight spaces and will often burrow into the bags and coat pockets of trainers to rest. They are popular amongst Alolan trainers for their stoic demeanors and observational skills, making them common choices for starter Pokémon.","﻿Evolves into Dartrix at Lvl 17Dartrix evolves into Decidueye at Lvl 34","Research Notes","","Grass/Flying"," 1'00\" | 0.3 m"," 3.3 lbs | 1.5 kg"," "," ","

Dartrix are obsessed with their appearances, spending most of their free time preening themselves. If their feathers become dirty or unkempt, they will be rendered unable to focus on anything else until they tidy themselves up. Consequently, they will also get angry at and stop listening to trainers that ignore their need for cleanliness. They can also be quite high-strung Pokémon; if they make an error in battle, they will obsess over it and often exacerbate the mistake by desperately trying to fix it. All of this fussiness, however, belies the fact that Dartrix are very skilled archers. When focused, Dartrix can sense approaching foes from any direction, even behind. They can fire sharp feathers, known as blade quills at opponents and strike them dead-on without even looking. Dartrix can even curve the trajectories of their quills to arc around obstacles and reach their targets.

Once its victim completely loses track of it, it will strike with a single arrow quill, plucking it from within its wing and stringing it on its vine-like tassels. Decidueye can fire feathers within a tenth of a second and over half a mile (0.8 km) away. It is said that they shoot with enough strength to pierce a pebble over 100 yards (90 meters) away. Decidueye can nock and shoot within a tenth of a second, and can expertly curve their arrow quills to strike unsuspecting foes. Decidueye can fire barrages of arrows into the air so that they rain down on many foes beneath them. Though they no longer are as fussy as Dartrix and usually remain calm and collected, they can sometimes become very flustered when taken by surprise. They sometimes pull on the vine on their head as a security blanket of sorts to improve their focus.

Litten are known for their level-headedness and lack of outward displays of emotion. They secrete flammable oils from their skin that coats their fur. When they lick and groom themselves, they store some of this fur within their stomachs, forming furballs. Litten can cough up and ignite these furballs to shoot fireballs at foes; the size of these attacks depends on the amount of fur collected, while the way they are launched depends on how they are coughed up. Instead of shedding their fur gradually like most felines, Twice a year, Litten will ignite all of their fur at once in a fierce but quick blaze. Though many trainers choose Litten for their collected natures, they also often find that it can be difficult to gain their trust and affection because of how distant and solitary they are. Many find that Litten respond best to a moderate amount of attention; they remain aloof with too little care, but are put off if smothered.

Torracat also have gained a burning desire for combat. In battle, they will not stop fighting until their opponents lose their will to continue battling. Torracat use their thick manes, which have actually adapted to take the place of standard whiskers, to navigate dark areas. This helps them locate prey in the dim undergrowth of their jungle habitats or under the cover of dark nights. Torracat also possess external flame sacs that adorn their necks. When they utilize Fire-type attacks, these sacs flare up and quickly begin to heat, allowing them to begin spewing flames within seconds. The sound of fire being expelled from these sacs is said to be akin to that of a brass bell. These organs also heat up and cool down depending on their owners’ emotions. When Torracat enter the fervor of battle, their passion keeps their flame sacs burning at maximum brightness.

These belts ignite as these Pokémon engage in intense battles, reaching up to 3,600°F (6,500°C). Incineroar live for the heat of battle; they can become so engrossed in fights that they may ignore their trainers’ orders in favor of their own. They may even hurt opposing trainers in their fervors. Perhaps even moreso than than fighting, though, Incineroar love the adoration of others. They fight most fiercely when watched by a crowd, using grand kicks and punches before finishing off foes with showy, fiery spirals from their belts. Though they try to seem aloof on the outside, the love of young children and Pokémon gratifies them greatly. They get very depressed when heckled, however. Incineroar also lose the will to fight when faced with weaker foes; they much prefer the challenge of facing opponents as strong as or even stronger than themselves.

Popplio are semiaquatic creatures; though they can reach speeds of 25 mph (40 km/h) when swimming and are indeed more agile in the water than on land, they have a rather unique technique that helps them maneuver in terrestrial environments. Popplio can snort elastic bubbles (made of water thickened with glycoproteins) out of their nostrils that linger for long periods of time. They can then leap atop of and around these bubbles to travel much faster than by waddling. Creating such bubbles takes a lot of practice, and Popplio are famous for their diligence in training their bubble-inflating skills. As they train, they can blow larger and more resilient bubbles. These Pokémon are also playful when not practicing; they love to perform acrobatic tricks with their bubbles in front of others, which also serve as trial runs for new strategies in battle. After gaining height by bouncing on these bubbles, they can attack opponents from the air in highly technical maneuvers. They can also pop their bubbles to damage foes with surprising force. Because of their dedication, playfulness, and acrobatic capabilities in battle, Popplio make an excellent choice of starter Pokémon for any Alolan trainer.","﻿Evolves into Brionne at Lvl 17Brionne evolves into Primarina at Lvl 34","Research Notes","","Water"," 1'04\" | 0.4 m"," 16.5 lbs | 7.5 kg"," "," ","

Though rehearsal can be tiring, these Pokémon never fail to get excited when they witness a new dance that they have yet to perfect. Colonies of Brionne can be observed dancing in unison under the light of the moon on nights of calm seas, often lead by a singing Primarina. In battle, Brionne combine their dancing with many large balloons of water to create stunning displays. As they prance about to confuse opponents, they slap balloons into them that explode upon contact. Brionne always strive to keep a positive and cheerful demeanor, even when they are upset, sad, or simply fatigued from their tireless rehearsals.

In battle, Primarina use the vibrations created by their voices to maneuver sparkling bubbles around the field. Only some of these bubbles are explosive; they can leap around on the non-volatile ones to further play with opponents. The sight of a field of Primarina bubbles glittering in the moonlight is said to be breathtaking. Primarina teach one another new songs in their colonies, passing them down over the generations. They lead beautiful seaside concerts on moonlit nights. Consequently, each colony has its own unique repertoire. Trainers must be sure to take great care of their Primarina’s voices, as they cannot battle without them. Dry weather, consecutive battles, and throat damage all imperil their vocal abilities.

Pikipek use their beaks to bore holes in the sides of trees and store seeds. They can strike 16 times in a single second with enough force to shatter stone. Despite their small stature, Pikipek in fact have incredibly strong neck muscles that enable them to peck with such strength. Their drilling is very noisy; they use different rhythms of pecking in order to communicate with one another. Since their signals are loud and distinct from one another, people that live near them often learn to recognize what different rhythms mean. In fact, Pikipek communication is one of the most well-studied in the field. Pikipek also have a fondness of shiny objects, storing them in tree holes. This is the root of the Alolan saying, “Something lost, something missed, check inside the Pikipek nest.” Pikipek can also shoot seeds with great force from their beaks. They will pull seeds from their tree holes to fire at attackers from a distance when threatened; missed seeds often end up lodged in the bark of other trees.

They are infamous for their loud, bugle-like calls as well as their lack of regard for quietude. The tips of their beaks are flexible and can bend backwards like “lips.” This allows them to buzz air through them in order to create their signature trumpeting. Though Trumbeak do not live together in the wild, they are not territorial towards others of their kind. In fact, they communicate with one another through their raucous calling; scientists believe that their cries are as loud and distinct as they are so they can clearly hear one another even across long distances. Over a hundred distinct Trumbeak cries have been recorded. When Trumbeak eat Berries, they store the seeds (which they cannot digest) within their long beaks. They can then fire all of the seeds at once in bursts to pummel enemies. This also makes them effective at dispersing the seeds of wild plants, spreading them far from their producers. Plants in Trumbeak habitats often have hard-shelled seeds that can withstand firing, and Trumbeak prefer these seeds because they are more effective at deterring attackers. In the late spring, male Trumbeak will begin to call even more loudly and cacophonously as they try to attract mates, much to the chagrin of people and other Pokémon alike.","﻿Evolves from Pikipek at Lvl 14Evolves into Toucannon at Lvl 28","Research Notes","","Normal/Flying"," 2'00\" | 0.6 m"," 32.6 lbs | 14.8 kg"," "," ","

As their beaks heat up, their segmented bands all gradually begin to turn red; when fully heated, they can cause severe burns upon contact and launch seeds with enough power to shatter stone. Toucannon can also heat their beaks to a lesser degree in order to keep their eggs warm. The only company that Toucannon enjoy is that of their offspring and their mates; their children will often bring back fruits and Berries to their parents’ nests, the seeds of which Toucannon can then use to power their attacks. Though infamous for being ornery, these Pokémon are seen as sweethearts when it comes to romance, as they mate for life. In Alola, pairs of Toucannon often are brought to weddings as a sign of good luck. Humorously enough, the raucous trumpeting of younger Trumbeak seems to irritate Toucannon just as much as it does other Pokémon and people.

To hunt, Yungoos stake out a particular route and then patrol it back and forth for prey. They do not stray from their paths, which they try to set in areas safe from larger predators. This is because Yungoos do not nest and are strictly diurnal; once dusk arrives, these Pokémon will simply collapse onto the ground where they are standing and doze off. They strongly prefer live prey and will only scavenge as an absolute last resort. Yungoos are famous for being introduced in the Alola region to combat booming Rattata populations. However, this measure of biological control failed miserably; rather than being wiped out, Alolan Rattata simply became nocturnal (to avoid these diurnal predators) and moved further into cities (which Yungoos consider unsafe).

Naturally, it takes them some time in order to learn about their prey, so these Pokémon will often go days without food as they hone in on their targets (once again a contrast to the voracious Yungoos). Gumshoos will spend whole days simply watching their victims without striking. These Pokémon are tenacious and will stick to a single target until they succeed. One trait these Pokémon do have in common with Yungoos, however, is that they are also diurnal.

They will use their mandibles to dig their nests into the soil. They also love electrical energy and will feed from power plants from time to time despite not being Electric-types themselves. It is believed that Grubbin gradually store this electricity within themselves as they prepare for evolution into Charjabug.

This is because these creatures can deliver devastating blasts of electricity to take down Flying-type foes. Vikavolt possess powerful electrogenetic organs within in their abdomens that can quickly generate large amounts of energy. They can focus this energy within their large mandibles before quickly firing precise beams of crackling electricity at foes. To bolster their already-powerful attackers, Vikavolt will also grasp their pre-evolutions, Charjabug, in their ​legs as they fly, using them as additional energy sources (since Vikavolt are defending their relatives by doing this, the Charjabug usually don’t mind). However, the extra weight slows them down somewhat and makes it harder for them to fly. They will drop their loads when they need to reach maximum speed or make a sharp turn. Vikavolt are very fast, agile fliers that can easily navigate through the twisting branches of woodlands.

They use their powerful claws to shield their vulnerable faces and stomachs in battle as they wait for their opponents to leave openings for them to strike. They also use these claws to strike trees and knock down Berries. Crabrawler will compete beneath trees for choice fruit in a manner quite similar to two boxers in a ring. Crabrawler have strong competitive spirits and despise losing; a defeated one will foam at the mouth as it faints. Bizarrely, these Pokémon have a strong affinity for heights. They will climb trees and buildings in order to reach the highest points in an area; they are even known to climb tall people. They will cling on tightly to these places once they reach them, punching those that try to pry them away. Crabrawler will often climb Alolan Exeggutor in search of Berries as well as higher ground, but this usually upsets the giant Pokémon and results in an unfortunate aftermath for the Crabrawler. Because of their competitiveness, only a single Crabrawler can usually remain at a local high point at a given point in time. Crabrawler use their claws so much that they sometimes fall off from eventual wear and tear.

Those that do reach these snowy summits will evolve into Crabominable. These Pokémon have evolved thick fur to insulate themselves from the bitter cold. Berries and other plant life are very scarce at such altitudes, so Crabominable instead feed on low-growing moss and lichens. They use their powerful claws to smash through layers of hard permafrost and access the soil beneath. Though predators are scarce where they dwell, Crabominable can lop off and fire their claws like rockets to defend themselves. The claws will grow back in just about a week’s time. Their claws also stay quite cold even outside of their snowy environments, allowing them to deliver icy blows wherever they are. Crabominable seem to oddly throw punches about as they travel, punching what seems to be nothing almost constantly. It is said many unexplained noises heard by mountain hikers can be attributed to Crabominable punching blindly in blizzards. This punching does sometimes come in handy, though; Crabominable can punch hard and fast enough to break an safe clearing through a crashing avalanche.","﻿Evolves from Crabrawler when leveled up in an area of high altitude","Research Notes","","Fighting/Ice"," 5'07\" | 1.7 m"," 396.8 lbs | 180.0 kg"," "," ","

Cutiefly use aura to find flowers that are just about to bloom to feed on their nectar and pollen. Eldegoss pollen is a particular favorite of theirs. They often compete with Butterfree for flower patches. It is said that people and Pokémon that are feeling especially strong emotions, whether positive or negative, have auras that resemble that of blooming flowers. For this reason, many Cutiefly may fly around the heads of those experiencing passionate feelings, expecting to find pollen. These Pokémon are often drawn to cities because of the many emotions present within people and Pokémon. They become especially common in urban areas during major holidays and festivals. In regions where Cutiefly are abundant, it is customary to leave out fresh flowers during large celebrations so that Cutiefly drawn to area, mistaking the multitude of emotions for a blooming field, can still find food and leave satiated. When threatened, Cutiefly use this ability to sense where opponents might strike next and evade them accordingly; the sight of larger Pokémon being outmaneuvered by tiny Cutiefly is often an amusing sight to behold.","﻿Evolves into Ribombee at Lvl 25","Research Notes","","Bug/Fairy"," 0'04\" | 0.1 m"," 0.4 lbs | 0.2 kg"," Bug | Fairy"," Bug | Fairy","

They are considered great Pokémon for children because of their friendliness as well as their ability to grow in personality alongside them. Young Rockruff are initially gentle, easygoing creatures. As they grow, however, they gradually become brasher and more rambunctious. Because Rockruff are popular amongst beginning trainers, many are unfortunately abandoned at this stage by those unprepared for this sudden shift in personality. Once they near evolution, they will begin to venture outside to howl at the moon at night; one night, they will leave their trainers and then return as evolved Lycanroc. Rockruff are fiercely loyal no matter how old they are; they have great senses of smell and will never forget an odor, allowing them to find loved ones regardless of time or distance. They will rub their stony collars onto their trainers to greet them; though many find this uncomfortable or even painful, it is simply a sign of affection.

However, they are fiercely loyal to trainers that have raised them since they were Rockruff, especially those that stayed by their sides even when they were acting rebelliously. These Lycanroc are blisteringly fast, using their speed to bewilder foes before attacking them with the jagged rocks in their manes; their claws and fangs are also very sharp. Broken fragments of their stones are seen as good luck charms in Alola. Midnight Form Lycanroc are also solitary, and specialize in countering attacks; they will goad foes into striking by drawing close and taunting them before crushing them against their rocky manes with enough force to shatter bone. They do not mind pain; in fact, the fervor of battle against strong foes causes their eyes to glow red and their blood to boil. It is said these Lycanroc may begin to foster resentment towards trainers that restrict their tactics, but deeply trust those that capitalize on their strengths.

If they fail to take one by surprise, they must cut their losses and flee. When Wishiwashi sense danger, their eyes will begin to water; the wobbling tears glisten in the light and signal to other nearby Wishiwashi that it is time to group up. These signals can reach up to 25 miles (40 km) away in clear waters. Schooled together, these monstrous School Form Wishiwashi are feared even by apex predators like Gyarados. They are known as “demons of the sea” because of their fearsome might—when each Wishiwashi in a school uses Water Gun, the combined attack is stronger than a Hydro Pump. Wishiwashi cannot eat or sleep properly in their School Forms, however, so they cannot remain in these states indefinitely. Schools will seek secluded areas of the sea away from predators to safely disperse in before returning to their normal lives. If a School Form Wishiwashi is sufficiently damaged or loses enough members, its uniquely synchronous cooperation deteriorates, and it begins to behave more like a normal school of fish.","School Form","Water"," 0'08\" | 0.2 m"," 0.7 lbs | 0.3 kg"," Schooling"," Water 2","Habitat","Habitat","

"747","Mareanie","747","Tropical seas and reefs, beaches, sea floors","Mareanie have posed an ecological headache for conservationists for decades. They feed almost exclusively on the horns of Corsola, both discarded and still-growing. Because the reefs formed by shed Corsola horns are so integral to the ecosystems of tropical waters and house many different species of Pokémon, researchers closely observe Mareanie populations to ensure that they remain in check. These Pokémon do not seem to discriminate between fresh and discarded horns, so Corsola populations in areas where Mareanie are found have evolved to shed their horns prematurely in case of predation. Once they have cleared a space of Corsola horns, they will trawl the sea floor in search of more. If they come across they come across live Corsola, they will plunge the large poison spikes on their heads into them to subdue them. Once weakened, Mareanie will use their ten spiked tentacles to finish them off. Mareanie can also extend their tentacles slightly or fire their poison spikes to take down prey. These Pokémon can regenerate most of their bodies if damaged (other than their heads); they can recover whole tentacles in just about 24 hours. Corsola horn artisans despise Mareanie for consuming shed horns and will take near-excessive measures to keep them away from hidden stockpiles. Mareanie poison is slow-acting; the first symptom is numbness, followed by an uncontrollable swelling and itching. In colder regions like Galar, however, some Mareanie populations have been reported feeding on species other than Corsola.","﻿Evolves into Toxapex at Lvl 38","Research Notes","","Water/Poison"," 1'04\" | 0.4 m"," 17.6 lbs | 8.0 kg"," "," ","

"748","Toxapex","748","Tropical seas and reefs, beaches, tide pools, sea floors","Like Mareanie, Toxapex prey exclusively on Corsola and consequently thrive in the fragile reefs that their horns create. They crawl on the sea floor with their 12 tentacles in search of Corsola. Toxapex usually remain sheltered within their tentacles, which form a spiked, protective dome around their bodies. This dome also keeps them firmly rooted into the substrate beneath, allowing them to endure the crashing waves of an intertidal habitat. In colder climates, it insulates them from chilly waters by retaining heat within. Toxapex can invert their tentacles (and spikes), however, to launch poisonous spines at enemies. They use their poison to subdue Corsola as they crunch on their horns. Unlike Mareanie, Toxapex seem to try to keep Corsola alive as they feed; that way, their horns can regrow and allow Toxapex to feed once more in the future. Somewhat macabrely, this actually makes them less of a danger to reefs than Mareanie, as they do not outright kill Corsola (though the destruction of their horns is still a significant threat to reefs). Toxapex are a concern to divers, however, as it is easy to accidentally step on them when exploring. Their poison, created by a sac within their bodies, remains in the system for three days, causing intense pain, with some aftereffects lingering for a week. It is virulent enough to incapacitate a Wailord if injected.","﻿Evolves from Mareanie at Lvl 38","Water/Poison"," 2'04\" | 0.7 m"," 32.0 lbs | 14.5 kg"," Merciless | Limber |"," "," Water 1"," Water 1","

Large herds of Mudbray were eventually hunted to extinction because of this, with only domesticated populations remaining. This is true, at least, everywhere but Alola. Mudbray still roam free on the islands, where they were able to escape the overhunting that decimated those on the mainland. Mudbray love to eat and play in mud. Though they are usually compliant Pokémon when doing so, they can become very defiant when deprived of mud. If kept from it for too long, they will firmly refuse to move entirely until they are allowed to play in the muck.

However, while they spend much of their time in the water, they primarily hunt for prey on land. To ameliorate this incongruity, these Pokémon have evolved the ability to create bubbles of water around their heads, forming them by excreting water and proteins from their rears. They use their arms to stabilize these bubbles as when they surface. Though their heads are soft and vulnerable, their bubbles help soften the impact of blows in this area. In fact, Dewpider use their bubble-covered heads to hunt and defend themselves; they can smash their craniums into victims with so much force that the initial impact feels much more solid than mere water, thanks to the surface tension that holds the bubbles together. Their soft heads are protected all the while by the liquid. Because of this technique, however, Dewpider are actually unable to hunt prey at all underwater, as their bubbles do not function the same way in an aquatic medium.

When night falls, they relocate to new trees in order to avoid draining areas entirely of their nutrients and killing the plants living in them. Morelull can extend their mycelium surprisingly deep into the soil. By connecting them with others of their kind, they can form complex communication networks and send messages to one another from far away. These Pokémon can scatter illuminated, pulsating spores from their caps, which can also glow softly. Watching these spores flicker has a noticeable soporific effect. Eventually, the spores will explode in bright, glittering pulses that other Morelull can interpret as various signals, most commonly one warning of danger.

Salandit can combust the bodily fluids produced by their venom sacs to create flames and release them from the bases of their tails. This ignition also produces toxic gases as a byproduct, which Salandit can also emit from the same place. The fumes have an oddly sweet aroma; those inhaling it often do not even realize that they are breathing poison until they feel lightheaded and dizzy. Given enough time, even the strongest and most resilient Pokémon will begin to feel its effects. Salandit prefer to sneak up on prey from behind and immobilize them with their fumes before the victims even notice. Humorously, Salandit have great trouble hunting Spinda, as their dizzying gases have little effect on these tipsy Pokémon. Female Salandit also have the ability to release pheromones that can influence males, both of other Pokémon as well as of humans. The longer a being inhales a Salandit’s pheromones, the further it falls under its control.

Since trash cans provide a steady food source for these Pokémon, however, they often remain in metropolises despite the risk of being touched, posing danger to unwary passerby. The short tail-like appendage on their rears is actually a scent organ that releases odors to communicate with other Stufful; they seem to hate being touched here even more than they do anywhere else.","﻿Evolves into Bewear at Lvl 27","Research Notes","","Normal/Fighting"," 1'08\" | 0.5 m"," 15.0 lbs | 6.8 kg"," Cute Charm"," Cute Charm","

"760","Bewear","760","Forests","Though they seem benign, Bewear are actually one of the world’s most dangerous Pokémon; Alolans often refer to it as the archipelago's most powerful Pokémon of all. Warning signs (oftentimes broken) demarcate their habitat boundaries in many areas; some even forbid all but the most experienced trainers from entering. Bewear possess absolutely immense strength; what makes them dangerous, however, is that they seem to be unaware of their might. These Pokémon swing their arms about absentmindedly as they lumber through forests, snapping trees in two as they go. Bewear are also very affectionate, showing their love by hugging. They hug with enough force to snap a human spine; indeed, this has historically been a not-uncommon fate of their trainers. Those brave—or foolhardy—enough to raise Bewear must be first be cleared by their local branch of the Pokémon League. Additionally, they must prove that they have successfully trained their Bewear to use nonlethal force in everyday situations. Bewear learn new fighting techniques by watching people and Pokémon train in the woods. Though their facial expressions won't change when angered, they will swing their arms about wildly as a warning before charging; this is universally considered a signal to start running away as fast as possible. After taking down prey, Bewear will tuck the carcasses under their arms and carry them back to their nests. Oddly, these Pokémon detest having their noses touched.","﻿Evolves from Stufful at Lvl 27","Normal/Fighting"," 6'11\" | 2.1 m"," 297.6 lbs | 135.0 kg"," Fluffy | Klutz |"," Unaware"," Field"," Field","

"761","Bounsweet","761","Tropical jungles","Bounsweet hop around tropical jungles, bouncing along on their springy bottoms. They constantly exude a sweet, fragrant aroma from their entire bodies. Many people find this scent calming, and some even let Bounsweet live in their homes as natural air fresheners. Unfortunately, their fragrance often attracts many predators; Toucannon are known to swallow Bounsweet whole with their large beaks. Though Bounsweet are far too saccharine for human consumption, their sweat can be harvested and watered down to create a refreshing juice. This sweet sweat is also excreted when Bounsweet exert themselves, ironically making them even more appetizing as they run for their lives. Bounsweet concentrate is sold in jugs specifically for this purpose in a number of supermarkets. Though their heads are quite soft, their calyxes are actually as hard as wood. They can spin their calyxes rapidly to drive off predators, but doing so makes them very dizzy. Additionally, Toucannon have beaks strong enough to crack their calyxes, so this defense is unfortunately often fruitless. They will hop aimlessly for some time after spinning. Since bouncing is their only form of locomotion, these Pokémon look happy even as they are fleeing desperately from danger. Studies show that Bounsweet are not very intelligent Pokémon, with some scientists suggesting that they may not even comprehend the threat of danger until a predator is actively chasing it down.","﻿Evolves into Steenee at Lvl 18Steenee evolves into Tsareena when leveled while knowing Stomp","Research Notes","","Grass"," 1'00\" | 0.3 m"," 7.1 lbs | 3.2 kg"," Sweet Veil"," Sweet Veil","

Steenee are lively, friendly Pokémon that exude an aroma even sweeter and more pleasant than Bounsweet. They can be a bit rough when playing, however, as they pay little attention to their surroundings or to others. Ironically, the avian Pokémon that once preyed on them as Bounsweet now often find themselves battered by Steenee as they try to \"play\" with their winged companions. Their calyxes spin around idly as they walk, knocking over objects and smacking into people and other Pokémon. They sometimes will not even notice when things fall onto their heads from above, as they usually bounce harmlessly off of their sepals. In battle, Steenee first strike enemies with their hard calyxes to stun them before delivering strong kicks to finish them off. Their legs are actually just as hard as their calyxes, as they are made of the same material. It is said that the more a Steenee is allowed to play freely, the sweeter its aroma will become. When Steenee twirl, they diffuse their aroma into the surrounding air. This scent is thought to promote happiness in those who smell it.","﻿Evolves from Bounsweet at Lvl 18Evolves into Tsareena when leveled while knowing Stomp","Research Notes","","Grass"," 2'04\" | 0.7 m"," 18.1 lbs | 8.2 kg"," Sweet Veil"," Sweet Veil","

Inhabitants of tropical regions have taken to imitating their kicks in some styles of dance. Tsareena are known to laugh or scoff condescendingly after finishing off opponents, kicking them after they are down. It is said that a blow from the hard tips of a Tsareena's leg will leave a wound that will never heal, both physically and emotionally. They can be difficult Pokémon to manage. They will glare at trainers who give them poor commands and may refuse orders if they grow tired of them. Only a few Steenee evolve into Tsareena in the wild, as they require the blessing of the other Steenee to do so. Upon evolution, they are tasked with the job of protecting young Bounsweet.

Comfey can grow thin vines from their bodies; these vines are detachable, but they ferry nutrients within them as long as they are intact. Comfey pick flowers and attach them to their vines, keeping them fresh and vibrant thanks to this flow of nutrients. Comfey also spread a sticky oil along their rings of flowers to enhance their scents and adhere them to their vines. The aromas wafting from their blooms can heal and comfort those around them. Comfey give their flower rings to those that they like, blessing them with good health (hence why they are so popular in hospitals). The vines keep the flowers alive for quite a long time. When endangered, they will toss their rings at foes to distract them as they flee. Sometimes, their attackers are so calmed by the scent that they do not even bother giving chase. Comfey feel barren without their flowers, however, and will quickly return to collecting more after tossing their rings.","​Pokémon and all associated names and characters are trademarked and © 1995-2019 Nintendo. All non-original images are provided by Bulbapedia, © 1995-2019 Nintendo.No copyright infringement intended.","Fairy"," 0'04\" | 0.1 m"," 0.7 lbs | 0.3 kg"," Flower Veil | Triage |"," Natural Cure"," Grass"," Grass","

They assemble their fans, for instance, by binding leave together with their own fur. Young or injured Pokémon will visit benevolent Oranguru for food and medicine, and Oranguru will similarly stop to treat injured creatures they come across. These Pokémon are said to be as intelligent as Slowking; they have been observed comparing wits with one another in regions where their habitats overlap. Oranguru can be difficult to raise, as they look down on trainers less knowledgeable than themselves and tend to act on their own accords. They also don't get along well with others of their kind, engaging in intellectual battles of wits when encountering one another to prove superiority (and territorial claims). Shockingly, Oranguru have proven able to learn how to manipulate human inventions like Potions all on their own.

Bosses will select 10 of the fittest members to accompany them as they search for Berries; this is done on a case-by-case basis, so Passimian must constantly train themselves to stay in peak condition. Each Passimian in a team performs a particular assigned role when foraging. Bosses will routinely conduct training exercises in which troop members must pass Berries to one another both quickly and accurately. The Passimian that can throw a Berry the farthest is the de-facto leader. These sessions are often long and laborious; some Passimian even end up running away because they are unable to handle the pressure. Passimian lob Berries at foes to defend themselves. They use soft ones to obscure their vision and hard ones to batter and bruise them. Troop members will never leave a comrade behind. Bosses pass down special techniques from generation to generation.

The odor of this substance signals to other Wimpod that danger is near. Wimpod are scavengers that will gladly feed on any waste they can find. They can digest rotten food and even human trash with no ill effects; in fact, scientists believe that such a diet helps create its poisonous defenses. Their many legs scrape the ground as they scurry, cleaning the surface below. They are valued as beach and sea cleaners for this reason, helping mitigate the effects of human pollution in tourist destination spots. Despite their meekness, Wimpod are also curious and will approach unfamiliar objects if they have remained still for a long time. They have a habit of storing what they cannot eat, like Pearls or shiny coins; this makes them prime targets for treasure hunters and Murkrow and Meowth.

These Pokémon also try to avoid needless conflict; they do not hunt, instead feeding on kelp, algae, and discarded refuse. However, Golisopod are well-equipped to defend themselves from danger. Their diamond-hard carapaces can shield them from most blows, while their sharp claws can slice with enough force to briefly cleave water or air right in two. Golisopod will try to fight as little as possible, only holding their foes off until they have an opening to flee and meditate in peace. Some say that this is a remnant of their skittish behavior as Wimpod, while others assert that this is a strategical decision that helps them save energy. When cornered, though, these Pokémon will do whatever it takes in order to neutralize the threat, taking advantage of every opening and using their small front claws to finish foes off. Golisopod are both a common prey and predator of Grapploct, who will frequently (and against their will)  initiate fights with them. Wild Golisopod are sometimes found surrounded by Wimpod; whether this relationship is protective or merely friendly is unknown. Golisopod rarely venture onto beaches, as their appearances often frighten swimmers into attacking them; this spooks them into fleeing.","﻿Evolves from Wimpod at Lvl 30","Bug/Water"," 6'07\" | 2.0 m"," 238.1 lbs | 108.0 kg"," Emergency Exit"," Bug | Water 3","Habitat","Habitat","

Sandygast dwell on sandy beaches, where they blend in perfectly with their surroundings. They use their bright red shovels to lure in small children; those who grab their shovels fall under their influences and are compelled to begin adding more sand to their bodies, making them larger. If a Sandygast loses its shovel, it may instead temporarily use a tree branch, flag, or other sturdy object it finds on the shore until it can find its shovel again. They are very protective of these tools and will try their best to fight to regain them if stolen. Sandygast can suck the life force of living beings with their gaping mouths. In Alola, it is a test of courage to stick one’s hand in a Sandygast’s orifice. Obviously, beach-going parents warn their children to not play with wild Sandygast or grab their red shovels. Incidence rates of such occurrences, however, have remained stagnant for decades despite these warnings.

The Beast Killer Experiments were kept secret from the public until an Aether Foundation defector escaped with a reanimated Type: Null. There are currently only three of these Pokémon in existence with no plans to create any more, as the ethics committee of the Pokémon League has deemed the Beast Killer Experiments in violation of research ethics.

Regardless of how they came to be, Minior can now be found living most of their lives in the stratosphere, being especially abundant in the ozone layer. They collect and eat dust in the air, gradually becoming heavier. Eventually, they become heavy enough to fall to the earth; when they land, their shells break away to reveal their cores. These cores can wildly range in color depending on the elements present in the dust the Minior ate. Strong impacts can also fragment Minior shells. Without their protection, Minior are faster, but they are also more frail; they will eventually die from exposure after landing. Capture in Poké Balls will halt this process, however. Alolan designers commonly use colorful Minior Cores as a motif in apparel; Minior crashes are rare in most parts of the world, with certain regions of Alola being an exception; whether this is due merely to chance or rather to a gravitational or meteorological phenomenon is unknown.","​Pokémon and all associated names and characters are trademarked and © 1995-2019 Nintendo. All non-original images are provided by Bulbapedia, © 1995-2019 Nintendo.No copyright infringement intended.","Rock/Flying"," 1'00\" | 0.3 m"," 88.2 lbs | 40.0 kg"," Shields Down"," Mineral","Habitat","Habitat","

Komala are given a log “pillow” by their parents when they are born. These logs act as security blankets, and these Pokémon will cling onto to them tightly. They are unable to sleep well without them, thrashing about wildly in their sleep. Trained Komala may instead latch onto their trainers’ arms for comfort, however. Komala saliva is intensely soporific; traditional Alolan medicine dictates that collecting Komala saliva left on tree leaves after feeding and diluting it in water will create an excellent sleeping aid. Recent studies suggest that their states of constant slumber may in fact be due at least in part to their diets; certain leaves these Pokémon consume have intensely soporific properties, which may be passed from mother to child prior to birth and then continually consumed as part of their everyday routines. ","​Pokémon and all associated names and characters are trademarked and © 1995-2019 Nintendo. All non-original images are provided by Bulbapedia, © 1995-2019 Nintendo.No copyright infringement intended.","Normal"," 1'04\" | 0.4 m"," 43.9 lbs | 19.9 kg"," Drowsing"," Field","Overview","Overview","

"781","Dhelmise","781","Open ocean, trenches and abysses","Dhelmise are very odd Pokémon; few people know exactly what to make of them. The “living” portion of Dhelmise (with the term being used very loosely in this context) is actually the seaweed, said to be possessed by ocean spirits or even the reborn souls of the algae itself. The seaweed strands wrap themselves around the remains of ships, binding together their wheels, anchors, and other sunken instruments to form Dhelmise. Dhelmise swing their anchors around with great force to defend themselves; they can knock out giant Wailord with single blows from these swings. It is said that Dhelmise that are unable to find anchors to bind themselves to drift about aimlessly in the waves, indistinguishable from regular kelp. To feed, they extend their kelp up to hundreds of yards away, binding prey and draining their life force. They are known to whip up whirlpools by swinging their anchors around in order to draw prey in. In Alola, daring fishermen will intentionally seek out such vortexes because they can trap whole schools of fish within. Sailors say that kelp stuck to ship bottoms are Dhelmise that have been attracted to the steel vessels and are trying to weigh down and sink them for parts. Dhelmise actually add new seaweed and detritus to their bodies as they travel, though it is unknown if these new additions become “animate” as well. Recent studies suggest that Dhelmise may hold a mutualistic relationship with wild Skrelp, who lead them to patches of wild kelp and in return are protected by these mighty Pokémon.","​Pokémon and all associated names and characters are trademarked and © 1995-2019 Nintendo. All non-original images are provided by Bulbapedia, © 1995-2019 Nintendo.No copyright infringement intended.","Ghost/Grass"," 12'10\" | 3.9 m"," 463.0 lbs | 210.0 kg"," Steelworker"," Mineral","Overview","Overview","

They often congregate in canyons and badlands far away from human settlements or even other Pokémon. Jangmo-o train diligently by battling one another; they take their practice very seriously and never miss a chance to further hone their skills. These Pokémon are said to have the hearts of warriors, as they will never turn their backs to foes and always remain humble about their fighting prowess. Jangmo-o use their hard scales to defend themselves from blows as well as attack enemies. Their scales make harsh, metallic clanging noises as they hit one another. Jangmo-o clang their scales to express emotions both in battle as well as in communication, making their habitats very noisy. Young Jangmo-o will clang scales together to build camaraderie and strength. Travelers will almost inevitably hear Jangmo-o in the wild before actually spotting them. Ancient tribes used to collect Jangmo-o scales and fashion war instruments out of them. They believed that ringing these instruments prior to battle would ensure their warriors fought bravely and valiantly. Anthropological excavations suggest that Jangmo-o were popular partners for military combatants in ancient Alolan society. Recently, scientists have found evidence that Jangmo-o scales are not, in fact, modified reptilian scales, but actually hardened fur; the implications of this finding have yet to be explored.","Evolves into Hakamo-o at Lvl 35​Hakamo-o evolves into Kommo-o at Lvl 45","Dragon/Fighting"," 2'00\" | 0.6 m"," 65.5 lbs | 29.7 kg"," Bulletproof | Soundproof |"," Overcoat"," Dragon"," Dragon","

At the peak of their fervor, they will emit war cries to signal to their opponents that they are ready for battle. Hakamo-o use their sharp scales to deliver slicing punches. These scales also help them deflect away enemy attacks, letting these Pokémon focus entirely on the offensive. Hakamo-o strike with such passion that they sometimes even tear off their own scales. Luckily, they will grow back almost immediately, sharper and sturdier than ever before. When Hakamo-o come across one another in the wild, they will brandish their bare arms to boast how many scales they have lost fighting ferociously in battle.

Tapu Koko is thought to be a fickle guardian that is difficult to please. It can be angered easily, but also quick to forgive as well. Because of its capriciousness, it may not always come to the immediate aid of those in need. Tapu Koko is also curious and quick to investigate peculiar situations. It has a habit of playing with or battling island tourists and newcomers that it has not met before. According to residents of Melemele Island, Tapu Koko seems to choose the island kahuna almost arbitrarily; they also agree that its decision always seems to have been the right one in hindsight, however.

Touching too many at once, however, is said to overflow one’s body with energy and cause great harm. According to mythology, Tapu Lele scatters its scales indiscriminately with no regard for its effects. Oral legends speak of a war Tapu Lele ended by soothing the battlers with its powers; Akala Island elders, however, recall a different version in which the deity stopped the fighting by scattering so many of its scales that all of the warriors perished. Tapu Lele is linked with both the restoration and loss of life. Some legends say that it draws its power from the pink flowers of Akala Island.

Tapu Fini’s fog is said to manipulate the very minds of those who enter it, causing their deepest flaws to surface and leading travelers into destroying themselves. Tapu Fini will reward only those who can make it through its fog with its water. As the deity can manipulate water, it will constantly create more fog from the sea that surrounds Poni Island; it draws energy from ocean currents. Tapu Fini always appears emotionless, even when it attacks; some say this is because creating fog consumes so much of its energy.

In past centuries, only the kings of Alola and their confidants knew of them, though they only believed one existed; they called it “the child of the stars.” They eventually handed it over to the Aether Foundation, who promised to learn more about it; its researchers gave it the name “Cosmog.” Though its exact methods remain unknown, the Foundation was able to confirm that Cosmog were related to the Ultra Space dimension. They believed that they originated there and could open “Ultra Wormholes” that connected to it. Using this ability was reported to greatly weaken them, however, and they only did so to warp to safety when endangered. To grow and repair themselves, Cosmog gather atmospheric dust. Their light weight means they can be easily blown away, however (though this doesn't bother them much). Aether Foundation researchers reported that their Cosmog was very friendly and trusting, even in stressful situations. It often escaped its enclosure to greet familiar faces, unintentionally making some experiments difficult to conduct.","Evolves into Cosmoem at Lvl 43Cosmoem evolves into Solgaleo at Lvl 53 under the influence of the sun or Lunala at Lvl 53 under the influence of the moon","Psychic"," 0'08\" | 0.2 m"," 0.2 lbs | 0.1 kg"," Unaware"," Undiscovered","Overview","Overview","

This phenomenon has only been observed once in recent times during an incident in the Aether Foundation headquarters, when the immense energy Cosmog expended to open an Ultra Wormhole led to the change. While gaseous Cosmog are light, Cosmoem are extraordinarily dense. Their black cores seem to hold most of their mass; it appears as if their core is actually slowly gathering matter and growing larger, supported by their hard golden shells. These shells seem to be harder than any substance known to man. Though Cosmoem are totally motionless, they are warm to the touch. Ancient Alolan legends suggest that (a singular) Cosmog has evolved into Cosmoem in the past, referring to it as “the cocoon of the stars;” one Alolan king had even built an altar in worship of it. Such myths state that Cosmoem originate from another world, and that they are gathering enough energy to return home. Cosmoem become heavier and warmer as they draw closer to this goal, gathering light from the sky above. Though Cosmoem are silent, a past Alolan king documented that he sensed that one desired to be bathed in sunlight; another king, however, wrote that Cosmoem longed for moonlight.","Evolves from Cosmog at Lvl 43Evolves into Solgaleo at Lvl 53 under the influence of the sun or Lunala at Lvl 53 under the influence of the moon","Psychic"," 0'04\" | 0.1 m"," 2204.4 lbs | 999.9 kg"," Sturdy"," Undiscovered","Overview","Overview","

It retains the vast amount of energy it had stored as Cosmoem, allowing it to radiate shining light from its body. When its flowing mane glows, Solgaleo is said to resemble a radiant sun, shining so bright that it can make even moonless nights appear as if if it is midday. Solgaleo can also harness the energy it had stored to create Ultra Wormholes to Ultra Space. When it uses this ability, a mystical “third eye” appears on its forehead. Solgaleo has the ability to create new Cosmog; for reasons unknown, it has sent Cosmog to Alola for centuries. Alolan rulers passed down mystical flutes used to facilitate the evolution of Cosmoem, as Solgaleo is said to protect Alola from great calamities. All references of this occurring in the past end the same, however; once Solgaleo finishes its task, it returns back home, with Cosmog appearing again sometime after.","Cosmog evolves into Cosmoem at Lvl 43Evolves from Cosmoem at Lvl 53 under the influence of the sun​Cosmoem can also evolve into Lunala at Lvl 53 under the influence of the moon","Psychic/Steel"," 11'02\" | 3.4 m"," 507.1 lbs | 230.0 kg"," Full Metal Body"," Undiscovered","Overview","Overview","

As it spreads its wings to do so, it is said to resemble a beautiful crescent moon glistening in the night sky. For this reason, some also call it the lunar emissary (as opposed to Solgaleo’s designation as the solar emissary). It is said that when Lunala appears during the day, it will absorb all of the sun’s light and cloak the world in the darkness of night. Lunala can use its energy to open Ultra Wormholes to Ultra Space; it can also create new Cosmog with its powers. With the power of mystical flutes passed down through Alolan rulers, Cosmoem can evolve into Lunala. In the past, Alolan rulers called upon Lunala in times of great danger. Once the threat subsided, Lunala would open an Ultra Wormhole and return to its home dimension.

Once coded as UB-01 Symbiont, Nihilego have recently entered public perception, as swarms of them briefly appeared in the streets of Alola. Onlookers reported that they seemed to sway like young girls; their bodies were glass-like and amorphous. A few witnesses adamantly recalled Nihilego attaching themselves to people and “infecting” them, causing them to suddenly act violently. This corroborates with the events of myth, as figures believed to be Nihilego were said to possess humans like parasites and cause them to act on their deepest desires; the island deities were the ones to defeat and banish them back to whence they came. Nihilego seemed to be of special interest to ex-Aether Foundation President Lusamine, who conducted her own personal experiments regarding it. Though released information has been heavily redacted, Foundation studies do suggest that this creature produces a strong neurotoxin-like substance. Other scientists found Nihilego oddly emotionless, with only some evidence of a survival instinct. Nihilego are believed to inhabit cavernous environments on their home world, though some believe that they may possibly be naturally aquatic creatures based on their physiology.","​Pokémon and all associated names and characters are trademarked and © 1995-2019 Nintendo. All non-original images are provided by Bulbapedia, © 1995-2019 Nintendo.No copyright infringement intended.","Rock/Poison"," 3'11\" | 1.2 m"," 122.4 lbs | 55.5 kg"," Beast Boost"," Undiscovered","Overview","Overview","

A few onlookers reported that they saw a Buzzswole pulverize a dump truck in a single blow. Confusingly, Buzzswole were given the codename UB-02 Absorption by the International Police; this means that they share the number with Pheromosa (UB-02 Beauty), though no explanation was given by the organization.

Pheromosa can also can produce a pheromone previous unknown to science. Exposure to it induces a significant hypnotic effect; Foundation scientists accidentally exposed to it during a breach recalled feeling mesmerized by Pheromosa’s beauty and grace. Pheromosa were traditionally depicted in all sorts of ways in Alolan mythology, as their great speed likely made them difficult to properly document. Oddly, Pheromosa seem to avoid touching as much as possible, recoiling their hands away from objects. Some say this is because they find our world “unclean”. Aether Foundation researchers believe that Pheromosa may live in a dry, desert environment on their home world due to their high tolerance for dehydration.","​Pokémon and all associated names and characters are trademarked and © 1995-2019 Nintendo. All non-original images are provided by Bulbapedia, © 1995-2019 Nintendo.No copyright infringement intended.","Bug/Fighting"," 5'11\" | 1.8 m"," 55.1 lbs | 25.0 kg"," Beast Boost"," Undiscovered","Overview","Overview","

According to Aether Foundation research, Xurkitree possess electrogenetic organs within their bodies that generate electricity, allowing them to let loose up to 1,000,000 volts at once; this number is actually an estimate, as the subject Xurkitree in fact caused the voltmeter to explode during testing. Inferring from the activity of the Electric-type Pokémon of our world, researchers believe that Xurkitree likely dwells in electricity-rich areas on their home world. Alolan mythology often depicts Xurkitree with their “tails” embedded into the ground. Researchers believe that they are able to draw electricity from the ground in this manner.

Thus, they postulated that Celesteela may naturally dwell in open environments where they can take off and land easily. Celesteela can also inexplicably root themselves into the ground like plants, presumably to draw nutrients from the soil. Witnesses reported seeing Celesteela land in forests with fertile soil to do this, burning down surrounding trees upon takeoff with its arms.

Reports from the more recent Ultra Wormhole incident corroborate their insatiable hunger, with many claiming to have witnessed them devouring buildings and even large swaths of mountains whole, using their pincer-like arms to shovel matter into their gaping maws. Even the Aether Foundation admitted that they quickly found Guzzlord too dangerous to work with, though they did note that they never recorded one producing waste.

It is said to have slumbered undisturbed for centuries. Historians have connected Necrozma with a similar figure in Alolan mythology that shares many of its traits; this figure was said to come from the sky in the same way the creatures we now know as Ultra Beasts did, leading many to believe that Necrozma is an Ultra Beast as well. Even Alolan elders wonder, however, why it would have remained in this dimension if this was the case, or why the island guardians have not dealt with it. Since no concrete evidence is present, the International Police does not consider Necrozma an Ultra Beast (though it is likely they keep an eye on it nonetheless). Necrozma is said to be darker than night itself. Its prism-like body is thought to refract light that enters it, allowing Necrozma to focus it into attacks. This creature is said to be extraordinarily vicious, firing lasers of concentrated light at anyone who dares disturb it as it voraciously searches for light to absorb. If it fails to consume enough, impurities build up in its body and turn it pitch-black, rendering it inert.  According to legend, Necrozma once attempted to consume the sun and the moon--possibly referring to Solgaleo and Lunala--in order to return to its original form, a radiant entity known as Ultra Necrozma. It hungered for both and desired to first hunt down one in order to harness its light and power to capture the other. Also called \"The Blinding One\" in the legend, Necrozma left the planet dark after absorbing all of its light before its inhabitants trapped it to prevent it from wreaking havoc elsewhere.

Engineered by a brilliant scientist 500 years ago, Magearna was created as a gift for a royal princess. It can understand human speech (though not speak it) and empathize with living beings; in fact, it can sense the thoughts and emotions of others as if it was its own. Because it can feel the physical and emotional pain of others, it works tirelessly to help them in their suffering. A device known as a Soul-Heart grants Magearna with these abilities; it was said to have been constructed using the life energy of other Pokémon and is its \"true body\", so to speak, making Magearna not entirely synthetic. When depressed or sleeping, Magearna can withdraw itself into the shape of a Poké Ball. It is said to have once been colored like a Poké Ball as well, much to the princess’s delight, but such hues are said to have faded with time. Some say Magearna lives in suffering, always feeling the pain of others, while others say it takes comfort in their joy as well.","​Pokémon and all associated names and characters are trademarked and © 1995-2019 Nintendo. All non-original images are provided by Bulbapedia, © 1995-2019 Nintendo.No copyright infringement intended.","Steel/Fairy"," 3'03\" | 1.0 m"," 177.5 lbs | 80.5 kg"," Soul-Heart"," Undiscovered","Overview","Overview","

"802","Marshadow","802","Dark areas","Marshadow is a mythical Pokémon that is said to dwell entirely in the shadows--literally. It is said to have the ability to sink into the shadows of living things and objects, slinking about from shade to shade. According to legend, Marshadow gains power and knowledge about the beings whose shadows it is hiding in, learning about their movements, fighting style, emotions, and even thoughts. Given enough time, it can intimately learn these things better than the being itself, enabling it to get the upper hand in battle when the time is right to strike. Some say it learned its fighting technique by dwelling in the shadow of a famous martial artist for many years. Marshadow is believed to be able to cause nightmares, especially ones involving malevolent shadows moving just out of the dreamer's field of vision. Despite these abilities, this Pokémon is very cowardly and wary of confrontation; it is said to never engage in battle without first mimicking its target from darkness for an extended period of time beforehand, ensuring that the battle will be quick and in its favor once it begins. When Marshadow attacks, its normally-dark body flares up with a spectral glow, and it enters a form known as Zenith Marshadow.","​Pokémon and all associated names and characters are trademarked and © 1995-2019 Nintendo. All non-original images are provided by Bulbapedia, © 1995-2019 Nintendo.No copyright infringement intended.","Fighting/Ghost"," 2'04\" | 0.7 m"," 48.9lbs | 22.2 kg"," Technician"," Undiscovered","Overview","Overview","

The URS's members claimed that Poipole were quite common in their home world, particularly in a settlement known as Ultra Megalopolis. In fact, they reported that Poipole in Ultra Megalopolis were often partnered with fledgling trainers, much as starter Pokémon are in our world; they appear to take well to human companionship and can easily understand human speech after some exposure. Poipole store an incredibly sticky, luminescent poison in their heads and can sprew it from their three protruding needles to attack; they seem to giggle happily when doing so. The corrosive poison cannot be washed off with water, making it very dangerous.

This poison is also incredibly sticky, serving to both trap and incapacitate victims. According to URS research, Naganadel's brain is in fact housed in its abdomen, and its three stingers are directly connected to the organ; their research proposes that the stingers may also serve as sensory organs of sorts. Directly touching these stingers, however, causes the creatures to react violently.

Their solid bodies allow them to weather all kinds of powerful attacks. These units work in tandem to travel and attack. Their eyes will turn red when angered, with all of them turning to focus on the threat at hand. Stakataka seem to detest having anything on top of them, including unfortunate bird Pokémon that mistake them for regular walls. However, according to one daring Aether Foundation researcher, these creatures will appear to develop a grudging respect (or tolerance) for those that manage to hang on for long periods of time, allowing them to ride on top of them without hassle.","​Pokémon and all associated names and characters are trademarked and © 1995-2019 Nintendo. All non-original images are provided by Bulbapedia, © 1995-2019 Nintendo.No copyright infringement intended.","","Rock/Steel"," 18'01\" | 5.5 m"," 1807.8 lbs | 820.0 kg"," Beast Boost","Habitat","Habitat","

Some inhabitants have reported seeing it zipping above the ground in open plains, levitating using this generated magnetism. Zeraora is commonly depicted with its fur standing on end from the sheer amount of electricity that is holds. It is said to be a powerful fighter, using its powerful claws to tear enemies apart. By electrifying its paws, it can even hurt opponents that manage to dodge their swings by shocking them with radiating sparks. Alolan elders claim that Zeraora is distrustful of humans because of how it was treated by a group of island newcomers; the visitors in fact came to Alola as poachers and betrayed Zeraora's trust, leading it to shun humans from then onwards. When a person sees signs of a thunderstorm but one never comes, it is said that Zeraora is responsible; its running is said to bring both thunder and lighting along with it without any rain.","​Pokémon and all associated names and characters are trademarked and © 1995-2019 Nintendo. All non-original images are provided by Bulbapedia, © 1995-2019 Nintendo.No copyright infringement intended.","Electric"," 4'11\" | 1.5 m"," 98.1 lbs | 44.5 kg"," Volt Absorb"," Undiscovered","Overview","Overview","

Meltan are intensely curious creatures, examining anything novel that they come across. They are especially attracted to metal; their liquid metal bodies can dissolve foreign metals from soil and other sources and incorporate it into themselves. They can circulate this metal within their bodies to generate electric attacks, which they fire from their singular eye. The hexagonal \"nuts\" that surrounds these eyes are in fact detachable, though Meltan will quickly become distressed without them. Meltan are social Pokémon that prefer to dwell in groups. By spinning their nuts quickly, they can generate a whining sound that attracts other Meltan.

During its time, its followers claimed in writing that Melmetal granted them the edge in combat and agriculture through the ability to craft stronger tools Melmetal is depicted as inhabiting a sacred forest grove with magnetite-rich soil, secluded from the outside world. Its body is said to be harder than steel, like as flexible as molten metal. According to carvings, Melmetal appears to be able to spin the \"nut\" in its chest to power its arms in a gyrating attack. Instead of dying, Melmetal is thought to rust and fall apart into many Meltan. Indeed, it is said that its worshippers protected these small Meltan in a mysterious box in order to keep them safe from a great disaster.

In the wild, Grookey live in troops with others of their kind. Their green fur contains chlorophyll and synthesizes sunlight into energy. Grookey troops can be heard from afar drumming in time on hard Berries. In combat, Grookey will strike foes with their sticks in a rhythmic pattern, growing in strength as they stay on the beat.

Thwackey love fast beats, and those that can drum up quicker tempos while still staying in time will win respect from other members of the troops. Thwackey will collect Berries and other objects of varying densities that make sounds of different timbres when hit to improve the range of their drumming. They are constantly practicing their rhythm by keeping time out of combat, walking and eating to the beat. In battle, their personalities shift and become more focused. Thwackey will get so engrossed in the rhythm of combat that they will sometimes fail to notice that they have already knocked out their foes.

These Pokémon have pads on the soles of their feet that radiate heat, scorching the ground beneath them as they run; a similar pad also exists on their noses. They take time to heat up, however, as the contents of Scorbunny's flame sacs are viscous and need to soften before use. For this reason, Scorbunny need to warm up before battles by running laps. This increases their heart rate and body temperatures, helping them reach their full potentials. These flame sacs are sometimes called their \"second hearts\" due to their importance.

These Pokémon are never satisfied with the quality of their kicks and can always find ways to improve. Raboot keep their hands tucked in and avoid using them in battle; this also helps them stay insulated. In combat, they will kick flaming stones towards opponents to scorch them, trying to score hits from unexpected angles in order to keep their foes on guard.

By weeping, Sobble can force nearby threats to cry as well through the vapors emanating from their tears, momentarily blinding them and giving Sobble a chance to escape. Sobble can also alter their body patterns when in contact with water to appear almost invisible.

These mucus-coated tongues are also used to snipe insectile prey. They tend to be antisocial and prefer to spend their time in the solitude of tree hollows and rock depressions. Drizzile will build traps around their territories in order to keep out intruders. For instance, they may fill ditches with water and then overlay them with leaves and mud to make them appear solid; enemies trying to approach will try to walk over the ditches only to fall inside. If foes do manage to avoid their tricks, Drizzile can form balloons of water by secreting moisture from their palms that they can then throw at attackers.

With meeker foes, they will instead try to press the attack to keep them off-balance. They can be a bit too eager when they see supposed openings however, and will often fall for feints.

When they sense something abnormal, their dots will begin to blink; this blinking will become faster as enemies approach, and more erratic when Dottler sense especially powerful enemies. If predators do manage to locate them, Dottler will release a burst of psychic energy to stun them before attempting to make their (sluggish) getaways. The longer Dottler go without food or water, the stronger their psychic abilities and thus their detection systems become. In fact, these Pokémon do not eat at all in order to maximize their psychic conditioning and thus hasten their evolutions.","﻿Evolves from Blipbug at Lvl 10Evolves into Orbeetle at Lvl 30","Bug/Psychic"," 1'04\" | 0.4 m"," 43.0 lbs | 19.5 kg"," Swarm | Compound Eyes | Telepathy"," Bug","Habitat","Habitat","

Orbeetle are constantly exuding psychic energy, which they use to monitor their surroundings. They can sense even the tiniest movements occurring up to 6 miles (10 kilometers) away. As soon as they sense danger, they will begin formulating a plan of attack. By the time enemies actually arrive, Orbeetle will have prepared an impenetrable strategy for victory. Orbeetle are also believed to be able to influence the minds of others that are near them. It is said that these Pokémon remember those who had terrorized them as Blipbug and Dottler, and will use their immense intelligence in order to concoct ways to torment them in turn. If a person is ever faced with a problem that seems specifically designed to ruin their day, it is thought that may have unknowingly angered a Blipbug some time in the past.","﻿Dottler evolves into Blipbug at Lvl 10Evolves from Dottler at Lvl 30Certain Orbeetle can Gigantamax into Gigantamax Orbeetle","Bug/Psychic"," 1'04\" | 0.4 m"," 89.9 lbs | 40.8 kg"," Swarm | Frisk | Telepathy"," Bug","Habitat","Habitat","

Nickit have soft pads on their paws that silence their steps, letting them sneak into the nests of other Pokémon (and the tents of campers) without detection. Then, after grabbing their prizes, they use their bushy tails to swipe away any footprints they have left behind. Nest owners will later return to find their food supplies missing, but no sign of any intruders. Nickit are so skilled at thievery that they rarely need to hunt at all, instead subsisting entirely on what they scavenge from other Pokémon. Nickit are cunning, but cautious Pokémon. They are rarely caught because they will bolt at the first sign of trouble, which their sensitive ears can detect from miles away. Nickit will patiently wait for hours in hiding for targets to leave their nests; even after this, they will wait a little bit longer to make sure that are not planning to return soon after.","﻿Evolves into Thievul at Lvl 18","Dark"," 2'00\" | 0.6 m"," 19.6 lbs | 8.9 kg"," Run Away | Unburden | Stakeout"," Field","Habitat","Habitat","

Thievul still raid the food supplies of other Pokémon like Nickit, but they also have developed a taste for eggs. Skilled Thievul can even snatch eggs from right under tired mothers by waiting until they doze off for a nap. These Pokémon will stalk forests and woodlands near areas of high traffic. When they spot a Pokémon (or person) who seems like a good target, they will surreptitiously mark them with their scent and stalk them home. Thievul will then wait for the target to leave again before sneaking in to plunder their nests. Thievul despise Boltund, who are their natural enemies in the wild. Because Boltund have such strong senses of smell, they can detect targets Thievul have marked with their scents; their speed also makes them one of the few Pokémon that can catch up to agile Thievul. Though they are normally solitary, skulks of Thievul may temporarily work together to dispatch interfering Boltund with their sharp claws for this reason.","﻿Evolves from Nickit at Lvl 18","Dark"," 3'11\" | 1.2 m"," 43.9 lbs | 19.9 kg"," Run Away | Unburden | Stakeout"," Field","Habitat","Habitat","

By twisting their petals, they can control their flight paths subtly as they drift in the breeze. Gossifleur will temporarily settle down wherever they find clean water and air. In such areas, they will land en masse and anchor themselves into the soil with their single legs, forming vibrant fields. As they absorb sunlight, their flowers will begin to bloom beautifully. Finally, when Gossifleur have had their fill, they will uproot themselves and begin drifting again, singing a joyous song as they twirl away in the wind. Fields where Gossifleur rest are popular amongst locals for being filled with their beautiful colors and uplifting melodies. Their pollen has a therapeutic effect, and Gossifleur pollen tea is a popular folk remedy for the common cold, particularly when given to children.

Eldegoss cotton is commonly used for sleepwear and high-end designer fashion; it is also combined with Wooloo wool to create a durable yet sheer fabric that is a specialty of the Galar region. The best Eldegoss cotton is believed to come from southern Galar. Eldegoss themselves rely on their cotton fluff to protect their heads from injury as they float on the wind. They also help these light Pokémon stay aloft by catching the breeze. Their seeds are packed with nutrients; as Eldegoss travel, they disperse their seeds into the land below. Many are eaten by wild Pokémon, but those that aren't enrich the soil and help future crops grow. Thus, land under Eldegoss migration routes is prized by farmers. Some regions will hold festivals in hopes of attracting migrating Gossifleur and Eldegoss to their farms, cleaning the local area too provide them with pristine air and water.","﻿Evolves from Gossifleur at Lvl 20","Grass"," 1'08\" | 0.5 m"," 5.5 lbs | 2.5 kg"," Cotton Down | Regenerator | Effect Spore"," Grass","Habitat","Habitat","

Wooloo dislike conflict; if a fight breaks out, they will tuck in their legs and roll away. Indeed, farmers take advantage of this trait by employing barking Yamper and Boltund to corral their tumbling livestock into pens. Wooloo have thick, shock-absorbent wool that is said to be able to cushion them from a tumble off a cliff. This wool is also commonly used to knit warm-weather clothing and carpets because of its great strength and insulation. It is also sometimes mixed with Eldegoss cotton to create a yarn that is both glossy and durable. Northern Galar prides itself on the quality of its Wooloo wool. Wooloo grow back their wool quickly; a fully-shorn individual will regrow all of its wool in as little as three months. In fact, Wooloo must be shorn periodically, as they will grow so much wool over time that it will render them unable to move.","﻿Evolves into Dubwool at Lvl 24","Normal"," 2'00\" | 0.6 m"," 13.2 lbs | 6.0 kg"," Fluffy | Run Away | Bulletproof"," Field","Habitat","Habitat","

However, these horns are purely for attracting mates and intimidating other same-gendered Dubwool; their backwards angling prevent their use in combat, and the horns themselves are actually somewhat fragile. Dubwool instead primarily rely on their thick wool to protect them. Their wool does wonders in this regard--unlike Wooloo wool, Dubwool wool is unexpectedly bouncy, deflecting physical attacks right off of itself. Fabric knitted from their wool acts much like a trampoline, and Dubwool “carpets” are popular amongst children for this very reason. Their spots also make it more difficult to shear these Pokémon without mixing the colors together and creating a mottled final product. Thus, most Dubwool on farms are likely kept around for mating purposes, as it usually more of a hassle to shear and process them than their wool ends up being worth.","﻿Evolves from Wooloo at Lvl 24","Normal"," 4'03\" | 1.3 m","94.8 lbs | 43.0 kg"," Fluffy | Steadfast | Bulletproof"," Field","Habitat","Habitat","

Chewtle are always teething, which creates an uncomfortable itching in their mouths. These Pokémon are always seeking something to bite on in order to alleviate this. After Chewtle bite something, it takes some time for them to reset their mouths into a normal position and bite again. For this reason, they prefer to use their horns first in combat to charge at foes. It is only when they see their enemies flinch and give them an opening that Chewtle will chomp down with all of their might. Both their horns and their shells are rock-hard. However, their huge heads make Chewtle unable to retreat back into their shells like some other chelonian Pokémon.

Yamper also have short attention spans and cannot resist chasing moving things like cars. They love fetching round objects like Poké Balls. Yamper can only generate electricity as they run; their electrogenetic organs are located at the bases of their tails, charging their bodies with energy as they sprint. Yamper will begin crackling with electricity if they run for long enough, as the energy has nowhere else to go but the surrounding air.

Boltund generate electricity by running and store it within their legs, reinforcing both their stamina and their strength. At full charge, they can either break speeds of 50 mph (80 km/h) by sprinting or maintain a more steady pace and run for three days in a row without rest. These traits make Boltund excellent at chasing down stray livestock. In the wild, packs of Boltund can be seen zipping across grasslands.

Their rough shape enable them to zoom across rocky terrain with ease. The heat they produce by doing so makes their eyes glow a reddish-orange, lighting up dark areas. They shed coal from their bodies as they zip from place to place. Though Rolycoly are afraid of water, they will undergo a quick burst of speed when crossing through a puddle of it as their internal engines convert it to steam. Unsurprisingly, Rolycoly were first discovered about 400 years ago just before the Galarian Industrial Revolution, when miners unearthed a massive coal deposit near Motostoke. The Pokémon quickly found their way into homes across the region, supplying coal for domestic purposes. The advent of the revolution led to a swift decline in wild Rolycoly numbers, though, just as they were first unearthed, as the coal they relied upon for survival was being rapidly consumed by human industry. This die-off continued until public outcry led to new regulations on coal mining and environmental protection. Today, historians credit this defense of Rolycoly as the first modern environmental movement. Rolycoly remain popular for outdoor activities like barbecues and camping, where small amounts of coal are necessary.","﻿Evolves into Carkol at Lvl 18﻿Carkoal evolves into Coalossal at Lvl 34","Rock"," 1'00\" | 0.3 m"," 26.5 lbs | 12.0 kg"," Steam Engine | Heatproof | Flash Fire"," Mineral","Habitat","Habitat","

They store their production on their backs as a fuel reserve, much as mammals store excess calories as fat. When Carkol produce too much coal, bits of it will simply begin falling off of their reserve piles. Galarians used to, and still do in some regions, gather this discarded coal to fuel their factories and industry. The discovery that Carkol could synthesize coal from other materials led to a significant drop in direct coal mining, alleviating numerous environmental and safety issues that accompanied the practice. Today, coal mining still supplements Carkol and Coalossal coal production, but at a much smaller scale. Carkol can combust their coal to breath flames reaching up to 1,800°F (982°C).

When Coalossal are fighting, their mountains of coal will glow bright red and radiate an immense heat. Sparks flying from their piles can ignite fires in more flammable areas. The anthracite that Coalossal produce is valued for its high quality and ease of harvest.

Avian Pokémon see exposed Applin as easy and delicious meals. As such, these Pokémon will patiently wait for evolution by hiding in their fruit. Once an Applin buries into an apple, it will leave only its eyes exposed, which have evolved to mimic leaves. As it grows, its tail will also pop out of the other end. Conveniently, Applin obtain all the nutrients they need until evolution from their apples. The type of apple that these Pokémon choose will determine how they evolve; Applin that bury into tart apples will become Flapple, while those that instead choose sweet apples will become Appletun.

Flapple will hide in the branches of apple trees with their wings folded and their heads down to mimic apples. When unsuspecting bugs fly by, they will dissolve them with their acid before consuming their catches. Applin have in fact fashioned the skins of their apples into their wing membranes. Though resourceful, they are not particularly aerodynamic and must exert a lot of energy to stay aloft. For this reason, they prefer an ambush strategy when hunting and only fly when they need to relocate in search of better hunting grounds or escape from danger. In some regions, people dilute Flapple acid with water and add spices to create a refreshingly-tart beverage.

As they dig, they will swallow sand and store it in their neck pouches to replenish their shot sand. They can hold up to 17 pounds (7.7 kg) of the substance in these pouches. As ectotherms, Silicobra rely on the outside environment to regulate their body temperatures. Scientists believe that storing warm sand in their neck pouches helps them stay warm during frigid desert nights. Silicobra are ambush predators that bewilder prey with blasts of sand before striking. They are not very fast, however; prey that manage to flee from these sand blasts can usually make it to safety before Silicobra can catch up.

By expelling all of this sand at once, Sandaconda can whip up huge sandstorms. They use this technique both to hunt  as well as escape from confused predators. Sandaconda are not venomous and instead prefer to construct prey until they suffocate with their powerful bodies. Though a bit arrogant when full of sand, tese Pokémon become quite restless when low on it, as they are nearly defenseless when their neck sacs are empty. Sandaconda mix sharp gravel with their sand to so that they can cut enemies even upon contact with it. Small stones that Sandaconda swallow while burrowing through dunes can become lodged in their nostrils, however, preventing them from spitting sand properly. Wild Sandaconda sometimes develop mutualistic relationships with Dwebble to take care of this; the Dwebble will dislodge the stones from their nostrils while searching for new shells, while the Sandaconda will refrain from eating their arthropod allies.","﻿Evolves from Silicobra at Lvl 36Certain Sandaconda can Gigantamax into Gigantamax Sandaconda","Ground"," 12'06\" | 3.8 m"," 144.4 lbs | 65.5 kg"," Sand Spit | Shed Skin | Sand Veil"," Field | Dragon","Habitat","Habitat","

Cramorant are greedy eaters that will often try to swallow prey while, leading to them getting their catches stuck in their throats. Their wide airways prevent them from choking, however, so these obstructions do not bother them much. Cramorant can in fact forcefully dislodge stuck prey to attack; more graphically, they can also regurgitate the partially-digested contents of their stomachs. In fact, this is how they feed their young. Getting startled will also make Cramorant spit out their food. Cramorant can be surprisingly strong in battle, but they are not the brightest; they have been known to forgot who or why they are even fighting mid-battle, especially when they are hungry.

Arrokuda will lie in wait until they sense movement before rushing towards the first sign of prey, hoping to impale them on their sharp jaws. Arrokuda are very proud of the sharpness of these structures and will show them off to other Arrokuda to assert dominance. These Pokémon are not the brightest and commonly cause issues for boats when they accidentally pierce holes into their hulls and get stuck. Boats sailing through Arrokuda territory will often have steel-coated hulls for this reason. Anglers will wave wooden planks through the water to entice Arrokuda to skewer themselves onto them, making them easy catches.

Meanwhile, their fangs can tear through shells and exoskeletons with ease. Centiskorch are rightfully feared by mountain climbers for their extremely hostile temperaments. When they sense intruders, they will launch their entire bodies like whips at enemies and then attempt to coil around their foes to burn them alive. Their flattened bodies help them chase enemies into rocky crevices and nimbly avoid strikes, while their tails act as decoy heads to bait out counterattacks.

"850","Toxel","850","Badlands, grasslands, swamps","At a first glance, it would appear that these baby Pokémon are prime targets for opportunistic predators. Neither skilled at camouflage nor offense, Toxel seem like sitting ducks out in the open grasslands and badlands that they call home. However, most Pokémon know to avoid attacking these creatures. Toxel in fact secrete poison from specialized sacs in their bodies through their skin. Even grazing them will lead to numbness, while more serious exposure can lead to paralysis. Furthermore, Toxel can manipulate their toxin to perform a chemical reaction and create electricity. Though the voltage is not particularly high, it is enough to create an uncomfortable tingling; in combination with their toxin, most predators learn to stay away from all Toxel after a single unpleasant experience. As they are neither very fast nor strong, Toxel primarily eat unfortunate insects that stray too close and become immobilized by their poison or electricity. These quadrupedal Pokémon have a charming habit of sitting upright like human infants. They will attempt to toddle around on two legs until they fall over. Even at this young age, Toxel display very apparent differences in personality between individuals. Some Toxel tend to be brash and impulsive, while others are more reserved and cautious. These personality differences appear dictate what form of Toxtricity they will eventually evolve into.","﻿Evolves into Toxtricity at Lvl 30","Electric/Poison"," 1'04\" | 0.4 m"," 24.3 lbs | 11.0 kg"," Rattled | Static | Klutz"," Undiscovered","Habitat","Habitat","

Both species can wield powerful poison as well as electricity in combat, and few Pokémon dare confront them in the wild because of this. Toxtricity can generate electricity by \"strumming\" at their chests; in fact, by clawing at the protrusions on their torsos, they can generate energy through the friction. This action also sounds very similar to the strumming of a bass guitar, making Toxtricity habitats sound somewhat similar to the practice room of a rock band. Unsurprisingly, they are a favorite Pokémon of counterculture music groups. Toxtricity can generate more than 15,000 volts by strumming in this manner. Amped Form Toxtricity have a reputation for being competitive with other species, while Low Key Form Toxtricity are said to be haughty and disapproving of those who try to challenge them. Toxtricity will seek out stagnant, putrid water and drink it in order to concentrate its toxins.

To investigate foreign objects, they will punch them with their tentacles; by doing so, they can test the objects' strength, durability, texture, and many other characteristics. This allows them to adopt new punching techniques for dealing with different situations. Clobbopus will \"study\" inanimate and animate things indiscriminately, and it is common to see them accidentally pick fights with ornery Binacle or Cloyster by punching them. Clobbopus can regrow their tentacles quickly, though, so even nasty injuries rarely hold them back for long. Clobbopus are amphibious and will venture onto land to hunt and explore. Even young Clobbopus are thought to be as intelligent as human three year-olds--and as bratty as well in some situations. They will throw tantrums if unable to punch what they want to, even if their trainers know doing so will cause them injury.

Then, they will venture onto land in search of worthy foes. Once a Grapploct sights a potential challenger, it will taunt the opponent from afar to get them to come closer. Once they draw near, the duel begins. Regardless of the battle's outcome, Grapploct will return to the sea after fighting to recuperate. Golisopod are a favorite opponent (and sometimes meal) for Grapploct. These Pokémon frown upon the use of weapons in combat and will in fact turn down challengers that wield them unless the weapons are thrown aside. Grapploct become quite restless if unable to fight for extended periods of time, and may even try to pick fights with Pokémon underwater if they cannot find any opponents on land; this usually does not go well for them, as Grapploct train primarily for terrestrial duels.","﻿Evolves from Clobbopus when leveled while knowing Taunt","Fighting"," 5'03\" | 1.6 m"," 86.0 lbs | 39.0 kg"," Limber | Technician"," Water 1 | Human-Like","Habitat","Habitat","

They spend much of their time lying in wait for unsuspecting passerby to try to take a sip of them, as they can only drain life force from within another being. However, because they taste absolutely terrible, they only have a fleeting moment to do so. Once Sinistea manage to gather enough energy, they will roam in search of a teapot to possess, leading to their evolutions. Though Sinistea seem to prefer fine china as their vessels of choice, they are not very good at detecting forgeries. Thus, most Sinistea in existence actually inhabit forged teacups; authentic Sinistea will bear a stamp on their bottoms. The swirl pattern on a Sinistea's body is its weak point, and stirring it within its cup will make it very dizzy. They don't seem to mind the addition of cream and sugar, however. In Galar, it is considered bad luck to leave a cup of tea unfinished, as one may be inviting a Sinistea to inhabit it.

Most teapots in circulation are forgeries, though, so finding authentic porcelain pots is quite a rarity. Galarians are taught as children to never leave a pot of unfinished black tea unattended, as doing so will invite a Polteageist to haunt it. To defend themselves, Polteageist will launch their tea into the mouths of attackers, immediately causing their foes to feel weak and dizzy. Strong chills are a common symptom of Polteageist tea consumption. However, Polteageist will willingly share their tea with those it trusts deeply, and tea connoisseurs relish the unique flavor, aroma, and experience that only Polteageist tea can provide. Too much can lead to an upset stomach, however, Polteageist themselves are quite picky about tea and will frown upon trainers that display unsophisticated palates when it comes to brewing it. These Pokémon are seen as pests in the hospitality industry, as they will commonly pose as ordinary pots in hotels and cafés.

"856","Hatenna","856","Woodlands","Hatenna make their homes deep within secluded woodlands, preferring isolation whenever possible. This is because the protrusions on their heads can sense emotions like radars, causing the Pokémon great distress when near sources of passion. This sensory system helps them detect predators who mean them harm well before they draw near. Hatenna seem especially sensitive to the feelings of people, and even more so towards hostile emotions. This has historically made them excellent warning systems for other woodland Pokémon to signal the approach of human trappers and hunters. When cornered, these Pokémon will release a burst of psychic energy to stun attackers before fleeing deeper into the wilderness. Hatenna raised by short-tempered trainers can grow up traumatized and unable to form bonds with others. Even well-meaning, but excitable trainers can cause their Hatenna unnecessary stress. For this reason, trainers seeking to raise these Pokémon must receive a psychiatrist-granted license ensuring their temperamental suitability.

A psychokinetically-reinforced blow from a Hattrem’s braid is strong enough to knock out a pro-wrestler. They can be commonly seen using these braids to support them like legs. Hattrem also dislike noise and will similarly seek out loudmouths and get them to pipe down, with force if necessary. Some people joke that their moniker “the Serene Pokémon” is quite unfitting for such an irritable species. In fact, they were named this in reference to the quiet, peaceful environments that they create around themselves through such policing action. In regions where Hattrem dominate, other Pokémon live in silent fear of their retribution—though not too much fear, so as to not trigger their dislike of strong emotions.

Hatterene constantly emit a low-level of psychic energy to induce headaches in strangers that come too close to their territory. Indeed, an unnatural quiet and a tingling sensation in the head is a good sign that a Hatterene is near. Many legends surround these Pokémon and their elusive nature. For instance, it is said that while Hatterene will usually mercilessly bewitch travelers who intrude upon their territory, they will make deals with those that they find \"tolerable.\" If a Hatterene shows a willingness to bargain, one should never renege on the deal.

There, they will wait for the occupants to notice their missing belongings before greedily sucking in their negative emotions through their nostrils. More clever individuals may create roadblocks in woodland paths or move around signposts to disorient and frustrate travelers. Groups of Impidimp can wreak havoc on rural villages by terrorizing townsfolk with tiny inconveniences. Such communities often have their own superstitions for keeping these pests at bay. One popular belief, for instance, is that Impidimp detest silver so much they cannot even approach it. Homes near woodlands where Impidimp dwell may hang silver talismans on their doorknobs to keep the Pokémon out. Scientific evidence seems to support this practice; while Impidimp are inherently weak to Steel-type attacks, they seem to especially despise pure silver.","﻿Evolves into Morgrem at Lvl 32Mogrem evolves into Grimmsnarl at Lvl 42","Dark/Fairy"," 1'04\" | 0.4 m"," 12.1 lbs | 5.5 kg"," Prankster | Frisk | Pickpocket"," Fairy | Human-Like","Habitat","Habitat","

Morgrem will alter signposts to mislead travelers or imitate the calls of children and Pokémon in need in order to trick good samaritans into entering their territories. These Pokémon are also treacherous; if caught, they will get down on all fours and pretend to beg for forgiveness. Then, when their opponents' guards are lowered, Morgrem will lash out with their spear-like hair to stab them.

"873","Frosmoth","873","Boreal forests, tundras, icy mountains","Frosmoth are elusive creatures that only inhabit the snowiest forests mountain peaks. As they fly, they scatter icy particles from their wings that freeze moisture in the air to create snow. Their wings can reach temperatures below -290°F (-180°C). Frosmoth are said to protectors of snowy areas, descending upon those who defile the environment in such places and whipping up powerful blizzards. In Galar for instance, a factory near Wyndon was frozen solid by a Frosmoth for polluting the nearby hills. Once a year, as winter ends, Frosmoth will migrate north towards arctic areas to escape the incoming heat. The land beneath them gets blanketed in a light dusting of snow thanks to their flapping wings. The reverse occurs at the start of the cold season when they return. These events herald the end and the beginning of the winter months respectively in many regions, and have developed cultural significance thanks to their beauty. Tourists from tropical areas will come in droves to witness Frosmoth migrations.","﻿Evolves from Snom with high happiness during the night","Ice/Bug"," 4'03\" | 1.3 m"," 92.6 lbs | 42.0 kg"," Shield Dust | Ice Scales"," Bug","Habitat","Habitat","

"874","Stonjourner","874","Ruins, grasslands","Stonjourner are mysterious Pokémon that, despite being Rock-types, are rarely found anywhere near actual sources of stone. Instead, they prefer to dwell on open grasslands and ancient ruins. Stonjourner have a peculiar habit of watching the sun for long stretches of time. All Stonjourner will at the very least observe the sun at its zenith as well as when it reaches horizon. Once a year, Stonjourner across the globe will journey to specific areas of the world and stand together, motionless, in circles. This event occurs at a specific date and time that all individuals seem to know regardless of time zones, weather, or other factors. They will remain this way until the sun sets, and then disperse as if nothing had happened. These Pokémon were thought to have great significance to the ancient peoples of Galar, as stone circles imitating this Stonjourner ritual have been found littering the region. To this day, many Galarian myths and folklore surround Stonjourner and their peculiar behavior. Though they appear immobile, Stonjourner can actually deliver very powerful kicks with their huge, stony legs; they dislike being interrupted from their sun-gazing and will retaliate this way if bothered.","​Pokémon and all associated names and characters are trademarked and © 1995-2019 Nintendo. All non-original images are provided by Bulbapedia, © 1995-2019 Nintendo.No copyright infringement intended.","Rock"," 8'02\" | 2.5 m"," 1146.4 lbs | 520.0 kg"," Power Spot"," Mineral","Habitat","Habitat","

"875","Eiscue","875","Polar seas","The most striking features that most people first notice about Eiscue is their cube-shaped heads. These are in fact solid blocks of ice encasing their real heads, which are considerably smaller. Because ice is less dense than water, Eiscue can in fact float on ocean currents like buoys in order to travel from floe to floe with little effort. In fact, this is how scientists believed they first came to more southern regions (compared to the arctic seas), floating along vast currents alongside icebergs. Eiscue catch prey by dangling their singular hairs into the water like lures to attract fish. In fact, the hairs are directly connected to their brains by a single nerve, making them quite sensitive. These hairs also radiate cold to freeze the immediate surrounding water; they are said to radiate even colder air when Eiscue have ideas. This is how Eiscue reform their ice blocks when they are shattered by attackers. The real heads of Eiscue are quite heat-sensitive, so the ice blocks help them keep cool in more temperate regions. Though Eiscue dislike being bare-headed, the worried expression of Noice Face Eiscue (as such individuals are called) is a popular emoticon in modern media. Eiscue are carefree Pokémon that will take hardships in stride; as long as they have their ice, they are willing to face just about anything.","​Pokémon and all associated names and characters are trademarked and © 1995-2019 Nintendo. All non-original images are provided by Bulbapedia, © 1995-2019 Nintendo.No copyright infringement intended.","Ice"," 4'07\" | 1.4 m"," 196.2 lbs | 89.0 kg"," Ice Face"," Water 1 | Field","Habitat","Habitat","

These Pokémon feed on positive emotions, sending and absorbing them through their horns. As such, they find it quite convenient that humans tend to congregate in cities and experience relief and gratitude when services are performed for them. Male Indeedee excel at butlership, for instance, while female Indeedee are excellent babysitters. In the wild, Indeedee will partner with other species to take care of nests while their owners are away. Indeedee are quite intelligent and know when they are being taken advantage of, however; individuals can touch horns with one another to exchange information. This makes them highly efficient at warning others of unsavory employers and ungrateful customers. Thus, treating one Indeedee poorly can easily result in Indeedee across the city refusing to assist a person in all manners of tasks. Historically, Indeedee strikes have been an influential force in labor reform. This has become particularly prominent with the rise of the service economy in recent decades.","​Pokémon and all associated names and characters are trademarked and © 1995-2019 Nintendo. All non-original images are provided by Bulbapedia, © 1995-2019 Nintendo.No copyright infringement intended.","Psychic/Normal"," 2'11\" | 0.9 m"," 61.7 lbs | 28.0 kg"," Inner Focus or Own Tempo | Synchronize | Psychic Surge"," Fairy","Habitat","Habitat","

However, when their stomachs begin growling, they turn into different beasts entirely. Hangry Mode Morpeko, as they are called, are absolute menaces, terrorizing everything around them as they search for food. They are not above acts of brutal violence against those standing between them and sustenance. Once Morpeko nourish themselves, they will revert back to their Full Belly Modes--but not for long, as their high metabolisms mean that these Pokémon will get hungry quite frequently. Morpeko generate electricity by stuffing seeds into their cheek sacs; when in Hangry Mode, this power is mysteriously converted into a Dark-type energy that can sometimes be seen radiating from their cheeks. Morpeko will roast these seeds with electricity to make them easier to digest. Even in Full Belly mode, they can be very protective of their food stores.

They prefer to spend their time near water on open savannas or jungle clearings. Where they are endemic, Cufant are famous for their spectacular load-bearing ability. They can carry up to five tons of weight without even breaking a sweat. It is for this reason that they were imported into regions across the globe, with varying rates of success. Their bodies are made of solid copper. This means that they will tarnish a vibrant green color when in contact with water. Oftentimes, a Cufant's feet will be tarnished from walking near rivers, while its trunk will be similarly tarnished from drinking in watering holes. Their heads and backs may also sport a mottled green from rainstorms. These tarnished areas are actually less affected by further weather conditions, and Cufant are ready for evolution when their entire bodies have turned green through this reaction.

"880","Dracozolt","880","Unknown","Dracozolt are an anomaly of modern science. When Galarian archaeologists first unearthed fossils in the desert near Stow-on-Side, they did their best to assemble the uncovered bones into their correct configurations. Unfortunately, they had uncovered no complete skeletons, but did not know it at the time. The result was Pokémon like Dracozolt, who they had assumed had a larger posterior end than anterior end as a quirk of evolution. Based on their jaw structure, these scientists had hypothesized that Dracozolt were herbivorous, feeding on nuts and seeds. Their powerful hind legs were believed the generate electricity as they ran. Dracozolt would have gone extinct as plant-based food sources dwindled, perhaps from their own overconsumption or a cooling climate. However, the community was in for a shock when modern resurrection technology revived the Dracozolt we see today. Of the fossil chimeras, Dracozolt are perhaps the best adapted, though this is not saying much. Other than their mismatched torso sizes, they can maneuver and feed with relative stability.","Also see Arctozolt and Dracovish","Electric/Dragon"," 5'11\" | 1.8 m"," 418.9 lbs | 190.0 kg"," Volt Absorb | Hustle | Sand Rush"," Undiscovered","Habitat","Habitat","

They hypothesized that they dwelled near icy waters and froze prey on their cold bodies to preserve their meals. However, their incongruous tops were clearly not designed to withstand frigid temperatures, so they suggested that the constant shivering of their heads and necks helped them generate electrical energy. This imbalance also would have made it difficult for them to move their oversized bottom halves, and perhaps this sluggishness would explain how they went extinct. Revived Arctozolt clearly show that two halves of separate Pokémon were accidentally spliced together in the reassembly process, and the Pokémon indeed display all of the questionable \"adaptations\" scientists thought they would possess. Uncomfortable in both polar and temperate climates, these resurrected creatures require intense external thermoregulation to stay alive.","Also see Dracozolt and Arctovish","Electric/Ice"," 7'07\" | 2.3 m"," 330.7 lbs | 150.0 kg"," Volt Absorb | Static | Slush Rush"," Undiscovered","Habitat","Habitat","

Most obviously, the Pokémon's two halves came from different species, and the head has been incorrectly attached to the wrong end of the tail. When first put together, paleontologists believed that these Pokémon were primarily aquatic, possessing remnants of what they (correctly) thought were gills. However, the powerful legs made them believe that Dracovish may have briefly run out of the water to ambush terrestrial prey, despite being unable to breathe air. They would have been able to reach speeds of 40 mph (64 km/h) on the sand, and their strong jaws would have helped them quickly grasp and drag victims back into the waves. However, as shoreline prey began to adapt and move higher up the waterline, Dracovish could not follow due to their gills, and thus died out after they exhausted what they could catch near the sea. Modern Dracovish can survive in fully aquatic environments, preferring not to venture on land at all if they can avoid it. Consequently, their powerful legs are of no use to them beyond slowly trudging along the bottoms of their tanks.","Also see Dracozolt and Arctovish","Water/Dragon"," 7'07\" | 2.3 m"," 474.0 lbs | 215.0 kg"," Water Absorb | Strong Jaw | Sand Rush"," Undiscovered","Habitat","Habitat","

What is more glaring, however, is the fact that their heads are in fact attached entirely upside-down. The paleontologists who assembled Arctovish believed that this odd mouth placement may have had to do with the fact that these Pokémon froze the surrounding water to immobilize their prey. As ice floats, perhaps this placement allowed them to feed on cubes bobbing at the surface more easily. We now know that this is not the case, and Arctovish experience great trouble eating. Scientists had also believed that their broadened \"faces\" (actually the tops of their heads) had toughened skin to defend against attacks much like shields. Ultimately, Arctovish were believed to go extinct due to the subpar respiratory abilities granted by their odd gill placement. Indeed, resurrected Arctovish do experience breathing problems, largely due to the facts that they have half of a mammalian and half of an piscine respiratory system, connected together quite haphazardly but miraculously in a semi-functional manner.","​Pokémon and all associated names and characters are trademarked and © 1995-2019 Nintendo. All non-original images are provided by Bulbapedia, © 1995-2019 Nintendo.No copyright infringement intended.","Water/Ice"," 6'07\" | 2.0 m"," 385.8 lbs | 175.0 kg"," Water Absorb | Ice Body | Slush Rush"," Undiscovered","Habitat","Habitat","

The alloy is also highly reflective, blinding opponents using the light of the sun. Its main drawback is that it rusts easily, meaning that Duraludon must take care to avoid water. Thus, they prefer to inhabit caves or mountains with large overhanging ridges they can hide under to stay dry from the rain. Duraludon use their two asymmetric hands to grind stone into rubble before consuming it. They must consume a variety of minerals in order to strengthen their bodies. In some regions, these Pokémon are seen as rivals of fearsome Tyranitar, battling one another for control of mountain territory.

These Pokémon are rarely found unprotected in the wild, however, as they are invariably accompanied by Drakloak or Dragapult. These evolutions both care for the Dreepy and use them in combat, launching them at high speeds towards enemies.

They can be seen playing with their Dreepy in the air by soaring at speeds of 120 mph (193 km/h) before launching the Dreepy even further forwards. This maneuver also teaches the Dreepy proper form in flight. In combat, Drakloak will launch their passengers at opponents at high speeds, teaching the Dreepy to fight at the same time. Because Dreepy approaching evolution will leave their Drakloak, these Pokémon frequently suffer from empty nest syndrome.

Zacian was the one that wielded the brilliant sword, forging it from metal particles in the air. Known as the \"Fairy King's Sword,\" it could cut down even the largest Gigantamax Pokémon with a single strike. Its graceful movements were said to appear like dancing, while its strikes were so fast that they could not be seen; those who were struck down fell with no pain. Zacian's blade was said to be able to cleave the sea in two. Some say that Zacian was Zamazenta's older sister, while others saw them instead as rivals. Regardless, according to the old version of the myth, the two heroes worked together alongside an ancient king of Galar to save the region before descending into the Slumbering Weald east of Postwick to slumber, their weapons left to rust.
