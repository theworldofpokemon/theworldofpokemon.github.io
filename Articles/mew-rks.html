<div class="paragraph" style="display:block;">Myths and legends aside, most modern scientists will agree that Pokémon as we know them today are the product of thousands of years of natural selection. The “survival of the fittest” dictates their physiology, anatomy, and behavior; it is why desert-dwelling species are able to conserve water while their tropical relatives can dispense of it, and why polar inhabitants insulate themselves with fur and blubber as their arid cousins wick away heat from their extremities. The environment selects for certain traits that are beneficial for survival, giving individuals that possess them a better chance of seeing their genes passed on to the next generation.<br>​</div>

<div class="paragraph" style="display:block;">The Donphan in the room remains, however. According to natural selection, nature selects for pre-existing traits present in a population that become more common over time because of their improved fitness. This makes sense for something like thick fur. Variation in fur growth is already present and easily enough acted upon through directional selection; individuals with more fur can stay warm and are more likely to survive in freezing climates. What makes less sense in this context, however, is why the majority of polar Pokémon are Ice-types. Beartic have wide paws to help them stand on snow, an adaptation that their relatives Ursaring have little use for. Yet they are also Ice-type; how does this help them survive in cold areas? Furthermore, as it is very unlikely their ancestors were Ice-type, how did this arise in the first place?

<div class="paragraph" style="display:block;">Perhaps we can take inspiration from myth to give a lead. The mythical Mew is said to contain the DNA of all Pokémon, a statement modern researchers have come to interpret as meaning it is a distant ancestor of modern species. According to legend, Mew can transform into any other Pokémon thanks to its all-encompassing DNA. The Mew-RKS Hypothesis takes cue from this to explain how Pokémon develop their typings: perhaps all Pokémon already possess the genes for every existing type, but only express one or two of them in a given species.<br>​</div>
<div class="paragraph" style="display:block;">Obviously, this is a paradigm-shifting hypothesis that certainly requires much more research than the scope of this paper postulates. Furthermore, given how hazy our understanding of the genetics of typing is, the type “genes” I refer to in this paper could very well be any number of related or multifactorial alleles; for the purposes of the hypothesis, a “Fire-type gene” refers to whatever set of genetic information correlates to the Fire-typing, as it would for any other type. Furthermore, this paper will not attempt to suggest the origins of such a genetic system, but only discuss evidence as to why it may exist today.<br>​</div>

<div class="paragraph" style="display:block;">The Mew-RKS Hypothesis is based on a number of genetic phenomena we have little explanation for. Firstly, many Pokémon change typing upon evolution, sometimes even gaining different typings if they have multiple possible evolutions (see: Kirlia). Secondly, some Pokémon change typing upon Mega Evolution, only to regain their original typings when they revert back (see: Altaria). Thirdly, some Pokémon can change their typings freely in battle and/or in the wild (see: Kecleon). Fourthly, closely-related Pokémon may possess drastically different typings despite having diverged relatively recently (see: regional variants).<br>​</div>
<div class="paragraph" style="display:block;">While the first three are closely related in that they involve a single Pokémon changing its own typing independently of the population it belongs to, the third is quite different. Regional variants, along with other genuses of Pokémon that diverged recently (like Beartic and Ursaring), are entire populations of Pokémon that all possess the same typing. How did Alolan Vulpix become Ice-types or Alolan Marowak Fire-types?<br>​</div>
<hr style="width:100%;clear:both;visibility:hidden;">

<span class="imgPusher" style="float:left;height:0px"></span><span style="display: table;width:25%;position:relative;float:left;max-width:100%;;clear:left;margin-top:0px;*margin-top:0px;margin-right:10px"><div id='common-1-border' class='galleryImageBorder' style='border: 1.5px solid rgba(50, 50, 50, 0.1);background: #fdfdfd;padding:6px;'><div class='galleryImageHolder' style='position:relative; width:100%;padding: 0 0 0%;overflow:hidden;'><a><img src="https://assets.pokemon.com/assets/cms2/img/pokedex/full/037.png" style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 10px; border-width:1px;padding:3px; max-width:100%" alt="Picture" class="galleryImageBorder wsite-image"></a></div></div><span style="display: table-caption; caption-side: bottom; font-size: 90%; margin-top: -10px; margin-bottom: 10px; text-align: center;" class="wsite-caption"></span></span>
<div class="paragraph" style="display:block;">The premise of the Mew-RKS Hypothesis is that the environment a Pokémon dwells in very heavily selects for particular “type genes” to be expressed at the cost of inhibiting the others. Secondly, each type gene actually consists of a suite of traits necessary for the type to be expressed. Fire-types are heat-resistant and Ice-types cold-resistant, for instance, as they would be unable to wield their abilities otherwise (a heat-sensitive fire breather would probably not last long). The reason why mainland Vulpix are Fire-types, for instance, is because the places they dwell in and the niches they occupy make it very beneficial for them to be so. As a secondary, necessary component, Pokémon that do not express the same type genes as the main population are usually not recognized as the same species in the wild, and thus are ostracized and unable to pass their genes onto the next generation. This is true of mainland variants brought to Alola in the wild, for instance, who do not mate with wild Alolan Vulpix. Thus, the mechanism presented by the hypothesis is that the environment at some point in time established a “type gene” that was the most beneficial for the species, selecting for it over time. This eventually made that type gene the “default” for the population. Consequently, even if conditions change, individuals with alternate typings are unable to impact the gene pool because of their physiological differences.

<span class="imgPusher" style="float:right;height:0px"></span><span style="display: table;width:25%;position:relative;float:right;max-width:100%;;clear:right;margin-top:0px;*margin-top:0px;margin-left:10px"><div id='common-1-border' class='galleryImageBorder' style='border: 1.5px solid rgba(50, 50, 50, 0.1);background: #fdfdfd;padding:6px;'><div class='galleryImageHolder' style='position:relative; width:100%;padding: 0 0 0%;overflow:hidden;'><a><img src="https://assets.pokemon.com/assets/cms2/img/pokedex/full/092.png" style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 10px; border-width:1px;padding:3px; max-width:100%" alt="Picture" class="galleryImageBorder wsite-image"></a></div></div><span style="display: table-caption; caption-side: bottom; font-size: 90%; margin-top: -10px; margin-bottom: 10px; text-align: center;" class="wsite-caption"></span></span>
<div class="paragraph" style="display:block;">Under this hypothesis, the habitats that Vulpix dwell in and the niche they fill must either be bested suited for Fire-types or must have been in the past. This makes sense; volcanic areas are essentially only inhabited by Fire-types and the hardiest Rock-types, fitting the “habitat” example. This is because naturally high temperatures keep these Pokémon warm without having to expend; rather than trying to cool themselves off, they simply have adapted to such conditions and even use them to keep their flame sacs heated for hunting more temperate prey. Their other common habitat, cemeteries, would make a Ghost-typing seem more preferable. Their niche, however, is hunting small rodents and birds; by not being Ghost-types, they not only avoid competition with the likes of Gastly, but also avoid a glaring weakness to common Pokémon in the area as well. While they could easily be, say, Ground-types and still fit this niche, it is important to note that there is much gene flow between volcanic and urban Vulpix populations. A Ground-type Vulpix would no longer be able to mate with the Fire-type Vulpix that compose the majority of the species; thus, the pressure for the Fire-typing in volcanic regions also influences urban populations, even if the Vulpix that dwell in cemeteries have little pressure either way. Essentially, Vulpix in cemeteries have little type preference other than not being a type weak to Ghost because of mild conditions. Because of this, even small pressure from gene flow with Fire-type volcanic Vulpix pressures the species as a whole to be Fire-type over time.<br>​</div>

<span class="imgPusher" style="float:left;height:0px"></span><span style="display: table;width:25%;position:relative;float:left;max-width:100%;;clear:left;margin-top:0px;*margin-top:0px;margin-right:10px"><div id='common-1-border' class='galleryImageBorder' style='border: 1.5px solid rgba(50, 50, 50, 0.1);background: #fdfdfd;padding:6px;'><div class='galleryImageHolder' style='position:relative; width:100%;padding: 0 0 0%;overflow:hidden;'><a><img src="https://assets.pokemon.com/assets/cms2/img/pokedex/full/037_f2.png" style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 10px; border-width:1px;padding:3px; max-width:100%" alt="Picture" class="galleryImageBorder wsite-image"></a></div></div><span style="display: table-caption; caption-side: bottom; font-size: 90%; margin-top: -10px; margin-bottom: 10px; text-align: center;" class="wsite-caption"></span></span>
<div class="paragraph" style="display:block;">
This also helps explain how Vulpix became Ice-types so quickly in Alola. The “Ice-type gene” was already present in them, with a combination of environmental and sexual selection keeping it from arising. A genetic bottleneck due to low population (and importantly low mate choice) make any sort of mutation more likely to spread throughout the whole population, but a beneficial one like the reactivation of a cold-resistant Ice-typing would spread especially quickly. With no gene flow with mainland populations, strong selection for the Ice-typing, and a lack of mate choice overall, it is easy to see how the mutation could quickly spread once it arose.<br>​</div>
<div class="paragraph" style="display:block;">
As for why Alolan Vulpix aren’t both Fire- and Ice-types, the discussion segues into why all Pokémon only ever express one or two typings overall. Simply put, each type gene also entails the suite of traits that accompany it. As mentioned previously, Fire-types must also be heatproof, Grass-types photosynthetic, Electric-types electrogenetic, and so on. Each typing requires a significant amount of energy in order to maintain these developments. Organisms do not maintain traits that cost energy with no benefit. While a Fire-typing would certainly be useful when hunting Ice-types, it also comes with a huge energy cost in the form of flame sacs that must not only be fueled, but kept significantly hotter than the subzero temperatures around it. Food is hard enough to come by in frozen peaks, let alone enough to keep one’s internal body temperature heated to hundreds of degrees. Some Pokémon, like Heatmor and Lanturn, may be able to reap enough benefits from this in order to recoup their costs, but for the vast majority of Pokémon, it is an overall loss.<br>​</div>

<div class="paragraph" style="display:block;">While most of the discussion has been geared towards regional variants, the Mew-RKS Hypothesis also neatly explains how a single Pokémon can change types. Evolutions like that of Shellder to Cloyster simply involve the expression of an additional type gene because the evolution is now able to make enough use of it to justify the additional energy cost (i.e.: unlike small Shellder, Cloyster can hunt enough prey with icy spears to recoup the extra energy of its Ice-typing). Mega Evolutions act similarly, except that the activated type genes are repressed again when they revert to their normal forms. Indeed, researchers did find that Charizard possessed what they believed to be “Dragon-type DNA” that expressed itself upon Mega Evolution into Mega Charizard X. Type-changing Pokémon possess some way to activate and repress their type genes repeatedly. This also explains why Ice-types are found in icy places, or Fire-types found in warm ones, even though it may seem to make more sense for Pokémon to develop types to help them combat other species in the area. Yes, a Water-type in a volcanic area may be able to fend off Fire-types; it also would require frequent access to water, however, which is a huge disadvantage. Additionally, it would require a way to cool itself off, costing even more energy. In comparison, though Fire-types are on equal footing with one another, they do not need to expend much energy at all to simply survive in their environments. Thus, they can afford to evolve other, more energy-efficient adaptations. It is better to be a Fire-type with a hard shell and smoky defenses like Torkoal than it is to be a Water-type that can barely scrape by simply trying to not dry out.<br>​</div>

<div class="paragraph" style="display:block;">​In summation, The Mew-RKS Hypothesis postulates that 1) All Pokémon inherently contain the necessary genes for any typing, but only express one or two in a population, and that 2) each type gene is associated with a suite of traits that accompany the typing. From this, we can see how some Pokémon so easily change typings upon evolution, Mega Evolution, and natural selection. We can also work through the mechanism by which populations develop the typings that they do and why Pokémon develop typings that do not necessarily seem to be the most beneficial ones to have in their environments. Pokémon adapt typings that help them survive against environmental conditions rather than trump other species. It is only when the benefits of a typing outweigh the opportunity cost that it becomes practical to switch; and even then, significant genetic isolation is necessary so that sexual selection does not render such mutations undesirable. Thus, it is only under extreme conditions that a species will change type once one has been established in the population. We have gone through the near-entirety of this discussion without referring to the second part of the hypothesis’s namesake; the “RKS System” was a project by the Aether Foundation to create a Pokémon that could possess any known typing, named after the mythical Arceus. If this hypothesis is proven true, perhaps those scientists were closer to perfecting this system than they had ever believed.<br>​</div>
