<div class="paragraph" style="display:block;"><span>The idea of life itself being an intangible, yet quantifiable force (though, not measurable by any means we know of today) has been a long-standing one in many cultures. Virtually every region in the world uses its existence to explain some kind of phenomena: Pokémon like Gengar and Dusknoir consume it from their prey; Flabébé and its evolutions channel it from other living things; Tapu Lele overwhelms people with it using its glistening scales. We accept the notion of “life energy” as true because we seem to be able to observe its transfer firsthand. When Gengar feed, their prey slowly become paler and more lifeless even though nothing physical leaves their bodies. Floette must derive their sustenance from flowers, as their grow sick and feeble without them—yet the flowers themselves last just as long as they should without their partners, suggesting a one-way transfer.</span><br><br>​<br>As scientists, it is difficult to accept the existence of something so intangible. Though we certainly have difficulty observing the very concept of phenomena like like light and sound, we can easily measure them and produce concrete numbers—how many lumens of light, how many decibels of sound. To accept something not by proof of its own existence, but rather proof of&nbsp;its interaction with others, is a tall feat that requires significant evidence. This isn't to say it is impossible, however. The prototypical example of this is dark matter, which follows many of the same principles. It is impossible to measure with current technology and is physically unobservable to our eyes. Yet we are rather certain of its existence because of unaccounted deviances in our mathematical calculations, unexplained variations in our measurements of other occurences, and unclear distortions in our visual observations. Though there will perhaps always be a vestige of doubt until we can confirm it with our own senses, all of the evidence points to the fact that dark matter does indeed exist.<br>​</div>

<div class="paragraph" style="display:block;">The same could be said about the existence of aura, to some extent. We know with almost-absolute certainty that it does exist; Pokémon we can clearly communicate with, like Lucario, refer to it frequently, and most humans that claim to be able to sense it describe the auras of the same people in nearly the same way. Those asked to single out a person from a lineup with dull green aura, for instance, will always pick out the same few people. Experiments with other Pokémon that can purportedly sense aura like Cutiefly also return consistent results. A Cutiefly trained to hover over living things with bright red auras will continue to do so when give completely different options than what they were trained with. The vast majority of humans and even Pokémon may not be able to sense aura, and science has yet to come up with an explanation for it (as unfortunately, people that can both study aura and are committed to science are very few and far between), but we can be relatively sure of its existence thanks to the consistent, reliable evidence provided by the few that can.<br>​</div>
<hr style="width:100%;clear:both;visibility:hidden;">

<span class="imgPusher" style="float:right;height:0px"></span><span style="display: table;width:25%;position:relative;float:right;max-width:100%;;clear:right;margin-top:0px;*margin-top:0px;margin-left:10px"><div id='common-1-border' class='galleryImageBorder' style='border: 1.5px solid rgba(50, 50, 50, 0.1);background: #fdfdfd;padding:6px;'><div class='galleryImageHolder' style='position:relative; width:100%;padding: 0 0 0%;overflow:hidden;'><a><img src="https://assets.pokemon.com/assets/cms2/img/pokedex/full/709.png" style="margin-top: 5px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 10px; border-width:1px;padding:3px; max-width:100%" alt="Picture" class="galleryImageBorder wsite-image"></a></div></div><span style="display: table-caption; caption-side: bottom; font-size: 90%; margin-top: -10px; margin-bottom: 10px; text-align: center;" class="wsite-caption"></span></span>
<div class="paragraph" style="display:block;">Ideally, we would be able to say similar things regarding life energy—it would be simple enough if we could draw upon the experiences of people and Pokémon that are able to observe this force firsthand to develop our own theories. Such a feat is easier said than done, however; people that claim to be able to see or sense life energy almost inevitably seem to be involved with the purported "spiritual world" as well. This certainly has merit of its own, and many believe that the two concepts are closely tied with one another. The fact remains, however, that an inability to separate the two from one another in observation makes any conclusions drawn from them shaky at best. This also applies to spiritual Pokémon that feed on life force like Trevenant; considering we know very little about how the Pokémon themselves function, let alone their feeding mechanisms, it is unlikely we would glean much information about their finer workings.<br>​</div>
<hr style="width:100%;clear:both;visibility:hidden;">

<span class="imgPusher" style="float:left;height:0px"></span><span style="display: table;width:25%;position:relative;float:left;max-width:100%;;clear:left;margin-top:0px;*margin-top:0px;margin-right:10px"><div id='common-1-border' class='galleryImageBorder' style='border: 1.5px solid rgba(50, 50, 50, 0.1);background: #fdfdfd;padding:6px;'><div class='galleryImageHolder' style='position:relative; width:100%;padding: 0 0 0%;overflow:hidden;'><a><img src="https://assets.pokemon.com/assets/cms2/img/pokedex/full/801.png" style="margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 10px; border-width:1px;padding:3px; max-width:100%" alt="Picture" class="galleryImageBorder wsite-image"></a></div></div><span style="display: table-caption; caption-side: bottom; font-size: 90%; margin-top: -10px; margin-bottom: 10px; text-align: center;" class="wsite-caption"></span></span>
<div class="paragraph" style="display:block;">The other issue that remains is that most other Pokémon with promising relationships with "life energy" are legendaries, and as such exceedingly rare and unstudied. The four most prominent ones that spring to mind are Xerneas, Yveltal, Tapu Lele, and Magearna. While others, like Ho-oh and Shaymin, may be associated with life and what it brings, these four in particular seem to be affiliated with the channeling of pure life energy itself. The former two are self-explanatory, as Pokémon representing and controlling life and death, respectively. Tapu Lele is said in Alolan mythology to scatter scales imbued with life energy; a few can cure fatigue and illness, but too many can overwhelm the body with energy and destroy it from the inside out. Magearna is of particular interest in that it is artificial. According to legend, its heart is a "soul-heart" powered by pure life energy itself. Machinations fueled by this energy are not new; the Ultimate Weapon of Kalos was said to be fueld by life energy as well. It should not be understated that while this technology may be lost today (unless the conspiracies regarding the "infinite energy" of the Devon Corporation are to be believed), its supposed use as fuel gives much hope that modern scientists may one day be able to understand and utilize it as well.<br>​<br></div>

<div class="paragraph" style="display:block;">If spiritual Pokémon are too unstudied to be of use and legendary Pokémon too elusive, it would seem that our knowledge of life energy must be limited to ancient myths and nebulous beliefs. There has been one aspect of tangible research we have yet to explore, however: Mega Evolution. According to Kalos legend, Mega Stones were created after the firing of the Ultimate Weapon, which released a burst of life energy that filled the earth. When a Pokémon Mega Evolves, the energy within its Mega Stone fills its own body to fuel its transformation. If this energy is indeed life energy, many of the process's consequences suddenly fall into place. The vast majority of Pokémon that Mega Evolve become aggressive, hot-blooded, and even self-destructive (see Mega Gengar, Mega Pinsir, Mega Aerodactyl, and many others). They continue to attack recklessly unless they are reined in by their trainers or their energy runs out. The burst of energy is large enough to overheat Mega Heracross and Mega Scizor, to rip Mega Banette at the seams, to blow the jaws of Mega Glalie clean off. Notice how this parallels Tapu Lele's story, where life energy from its scales grant strength, but also destruction in large quantities.<br>​</div>

<div class="paragraph" style="display:block;">When Lucario Mega Evolve, the surge of energy is so great that it sears their skin where it courses through their bodies. This pattern is the same each time they Mega Evolve, indicating a set series of pathways this energy travels through. Professor Sycamore of Kalos published a promising paper regarding this; using a small box of Tapu Lele's scales his assistants brought back from Alola, he placed a small pinch of them at the feet of a Lucario and asked it to trace the passage of what it felt as "energy" from the bottom up. The course it traced lined up with its set of markings as Mega Lucario, as did those of the three other Lucario tested (the fifth reported no sensation, as the scales had seemingly run out of energy). Despite the small sample size, the experiment very heavily indicated a relationship between the energy of Mega Evolution and the purported "life energy" Tapu Lele wields in legend.<br>​</div>

<div class="paragraph" style="display:block;">Readers should note that the heavy references to Tapu Lele in such experiments are not because the Alolan mythology has a stronger connection to life energy than other regions; in fact, I would argue that Kalos, with its troubled history regarding Xerneas, Yveltal, and the Ultimate Weapon, is more closely affiliated with it. Rather, Tapu Lele is simply the most accessible of the life energy-related legendaries; it appears relatively often to the residents of Akala Island and even more frequently to the island kahuna, making its myths easier to confirm or deny. As mentioned before, other regions certainly have a plethora of legends regarding life energy. Kyogre and Groudon in Hoenn are said to draw upon "natural" energy, which is distinguished as different than the energy of Mega Evolution in source but not function, for Primal Reversion. Rayquaza is said to obtain energy from meteoroids for Mega Evolution rather than Mega Stones; because of its unique mikado organ, however, which can store and convert such energy, it can be regarded as an exception rather than the rule. Ho-oh in Johto famously resurrected the three legendary beasts of the Brass Tower, presumably using life energy in some fashion. Magearna is said to gain energy from fallen comrades via its Soul-Heart in a mechanism eerily similar to that of the Ultimate Weapon.<br><br>Though we may not be able to measure life energy or even sense it on our own, we do have a wide range of evidence supporting its existence. Unsubstantiated mythology aside, the Ultimate Weapon certainly did exist and ran on something that its creator referred to as "life energy." This is likely the same energy found within Mega Stones, as the phenomenon of Mega Evolution and the Ultimate Weapon are closely linked (based on historical records stored in the Tower of Mastery in Kalos and other places, the stones did not appear until after the weapon was fired). This energy in turn is very similar to that imbued in the scales of the Alolan guardian of life, Tapu Lele, as proven by Sycamore's experiments. Like dark matter, though we cannot observe life energy directly, we can see how perfectly it connects previously-unexplained aspects of what we can understand. The energy of the Ultimate Weapon and Magearna's Soul-Heart, of Mega Evolution and Primal Reversion, of Ho-oh and Tapu Lele, all in fact seems to be one and the same. It is both human and healthy to maintain doubt about what we ourselves cannot witness, but even in science, a little faith can go a long way when it comes to finding a new lead into a previously-undiscovered field of study. I find it comforting to liken the unmeasurable unknown to a shadow in darkness; we may never truly see what casts it, but we can at the very least illuminate the world around it to reveal its true form.</div>
