<div class="paragraph" style="display:block;">Since hardly anyone (or everyone) can recognize the National Pokédex numbers by memory, the three numbers listed in the title refer to Magby, Magmar, and Magmortar. Readers can easily recognize these Pokémon as evolutionary relatives; however, they may also notice that they are separated by over a hundred numbers between each; this seems incredibly inefficient. A beginning trainer may not know that Magmar evolves, for instance, as its evolution is over 300 spots away down the list. Even experienced trainers may find it a hassle to scroll down to Roserade all the way from Roselia. There must certainly be a better way.<br>​</div>
<div class="paragraph" style="display:block;">The (ironically) international use of the sometimes-confusing National Pokédex numbers is certainly not because of a lack of alternatives. Just last year, for instance, the Familial Pokédex Organization (as the name suggests) proposed an ordering that would place related Pokémon next to one another, solving the problem posed in the title. Other alternatives include the perennially-favored alphabetical order, the novel "environmental" order (placing Pokémon with similar habitats together), and the interesting "difficulty" order (placing Pokémon most easily caught and raised by trainers at the beginning, though this is clearly geared torwards beginning trainers). Why is the National Dex order officially and consistently used for international affairs over these options?<br>​</div>
<hr style="width:100%;clear:both;visibility:hidden;">

<div class="paragraph" style="display:block;">The answer is rather underwhelming; first convenience, then convention. In the past and still today, regions each kept their own unique regional listings that contained Pokémon native to their territory. This helped trainers keep track of which Pokémon that have and have not already encountered. Though trainers that truly wanted to could obtain the listings of other regions, there was little need to do so; the average person had little use for a list of hundreds of Pokémon they likely would never see, let alone capture, during their lifetimes. With the globalization of travel, however, trainers suddenly became able to visit other regions and capture new Pokémon. This created a huge problem when they returned home, as these Pokémon were not in the regional listings of their homelands and could not be easily retrofitted into preexisting bureaucratic and technological systems that relied on such numbers. An interregional effort was required.<br>​</div>

<div class="paragraph" style="display:block;">One of the two primary problems regarding multiple regional listings was that the same number could easily refer to different Pokémon in different listings. The other was that the same Pokémon could occupy different numbers in different listings if it was native to multiple regions. Professors Oak and Elm, of Kanto and Johto respectively, had in fact faced this problem before when combining their own regional listings into one. Because they had already devised a system for the process, they headed the process of creating a national listing. Like most other regions, each professor had ordered their listings by evolutionary relatives. They entered Pokémon in the same sequence as they appeared in their research journals; consequently, traveling trainers starting their journeys where the professors did would also encounter the same Pokémon in approximately the same order, while those starting elsewhere would see the same progression, only starting at a different number.<br>​</div>
<hr style="width:100%;clear:both;visibility:hidden;">

<div class="paragraph" style="display:block;">​When combining their listings, Kanto was placed first due to Oak's seniority. Removing Pokémon that already appeared in the Kanto listing, the remaining species of Johto were added second. Of course, this led to the primary issue posed in the introduction—related Pokémon were now separated. This was because Professor Elm, with his studies of Pokémon breeding, had discovered a number of baby Pokémon during his research. There were also a handful of Pokémon evolutions Oak had not documented (had Johto been first, this likely would have been true of Elm's listing as well). Nevertheless, Oak maintained that Elm's novel discoveries should be kept as he had recorded them, so that Pokémon from 152-251 will have been "discovered in Johto" regardless of evolutionary relationships.

<div class="paragraph" style="display:block;">
​This established a precedent. When subsequent regions sent in their listings, previously-listed Pokémon would be removed while the remaining ones would be added in the order that they already were to the end of the national listing. Hoenn occupied spots from 252-386, Sinnoh from 387-493, and so on. As historically-inclined readers may recognize, this interregional effort to establish a national listing (and later National Pokédex) was the first act that arguably contributed to the formation of the Pokémon League.<br>​</div>

<div class="paragraph" style="display:block;">As for why the national listing remains in use today, much like in physics, the answer is "convention." Modern documents and programs were written with National Pokédex numbers in mind, and changing the listing so different Pokémon now occupy these values would be a major headache for companies and researchers worldwide. The original reason still remains as well; asked last year about the Familial Pokédex Organization's growth, Professor Oak remained adamant that even with an increasingly globalized world like today's, regional pride still had value. As he argued, there is value to a Kanto native being able to say that 1-151 were discovered back home, just as there is for a Unova native being able to say the same about 494-649. I can certainly see where he is coming from; though I can't explain it, I do feel a sense of accomplishment in knowing that Pokémon like Mudbray are "Alola's," even if I didn't discover them myself. Regardless of sentiment, the National Pokédex listing has ingrained itself into our society, research, and history, and it likely will remain there for decades to come.<br>​</div>
