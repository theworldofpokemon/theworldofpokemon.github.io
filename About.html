<h2 id="HowTo"></h2>
<p id="text1">
Welcome to The World of Pokémon! This website is the product of nearly 5 years (and counting!) of work by just one person with a passion for both biology and the Pokémon games.</p>

<br/>

<p id="text2">Initially, the project was intended to be a printed encyclopedia detailing all species of known Pokémon from the perspective of in-universe researchers, written as a reference text easily accessible to the public rather than a series of scientific papers. It was inspired by my childhood pastime of reading animal encyclopedias and field guides. I wanted to synthesize what we know about Pokémon with what we know about real organisms to flesh out how these fictional species behave in their habitats. As such, each entry strives to build upon small Pokédex entries with novel information to paint a fully-fledged, functional species that interacts with and against its environment. As time went on, however, I began to broaden the scope of the project to include other aspects like the research notes and habitats; I also started to draft articles about locations, people, and other non-Pokémon entities. Eventually, I realized that containing it all in a single book simply wasn't feasible.
</p>

<br/>

<p id="text3">Thus, The World of Pokémon was born. A website medium allowed me to expand the scope of what I could cover. On top of that, it enabled me to continuously update what I had written before—one of the biggest issues with the previous printed medium was that it was never "finished," and thus I could never properly share it with others. Some aspects of the book this website was adapted from still remain; most notably, all of the main entries are almost exactly the same arbitrary length, as they were each initially written to fill one page of the encyclopedia. Because I strove to never exclude information due to length, this rendered some entries very awkwardly phrased so as to fit everything in; this is slowly but surely getting fixed.</p>

<br/>

<p id="text4"> This website is far from finished, and there's a good chance it never truly will be. It inevitably gets updated when new Pokémon are revealed, of course. I also plan to expand upon locations and other aspects of the Pokémon world, which likely will take quite some time as well. As it stands, though, I am proud to stand behind this website and share it with you all.</p>

<p id="text5">Since there are a lot of pages and not a lot of explanation, click on a section below for an explanation of what it entails. Articles in the about page "break the fourth wall" and are not written from an in-world perspective like the rest of the site.</p>
