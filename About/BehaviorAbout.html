<div class="paragraph"><strong><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)"><font size="7">Overview<br></font></span></strong>​<br>Pokémon behavior refers the standard expected personalities and responses for each species. The research notes for each family quantifies this for each evolutionary stage using three values: temperament, disposition, and response, in the form&nbsp;<em><strong>(Temperament / Disposition / Response)</strong></em>. All values range from -2 to 2.</div>

<div class="paragraph"><strong><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)"><font size="7">Behavior Scales<br>​</font><br><font size="5">Temperament</font></span></strong><br>How the species reacts to unknown stimuli. In general, Pokémon can either be skittish, nonreactive, or bold. A skittish Pokémon is wary of the unknown. A nonreactive Pokémon does, unsurprisingly, not respond significantly to unknown stimuli. A bold Pokémon is not afraid of unknown stimuli.<br><br>Ranges from -2 to 2. A skittish Pokémon is scored -2; a nonreactive Pokémon is scored 0; a bold Pokémon is scored 2. A slightly skittish Pokémon is scored -1, and a slightly bold Pokémon is scored 1.<br><br><strong><font size="5">Disposition</font></strong><br>How the species is predisposed towards humans. In general, Pokémon can be friendly, ambivalent, or hostile towards humans. A friendly Pokémon has a positive opinion of humans and accordingly reacts positively around them. An ambivalent Pokémon has a neutral opinion or no opinion of humans and would not react significantly towards them. A hostile Pokémon has a negative opinion of humans and reacts negatively towards them.<br><br>Ranges from -2 to 2. A friendly Pokémon is scored -2; an ambivalent Pokémon is scored 0; a hostile Pokémon is scored 2. A slightly friendly Pokémon is scored -1, and a slightly hostile Pokémon is scored 1.<br><br><strong><font size="5">Response</font></strong><br>How the species tends to respond to danger. Between fighting and fleeing, some Pokémon tend towards either end exclusively, while others have a preference but may act the other way in some situations.<br><br>Ranges from -2 to 2. A Pokémon that always flees is scored -2; a Pokémon that equally fights and flees is scored 0; a Pokémon that always fights is scored 2. A Pokémon with an intermediate score of -1 tends to flee but will sometimes fight, and a Pokémon with an intermediate score of 1 tends to fight &nbsp;but will sometimes flee.</div>

<div class="paragraph"><strong><font size="7">Categories<br>​</font></strong>​<br>In the research notes, Pokémon behavior is noted in the form <strong><em>(Temperament / Disposition / Response)</em></strong>; for instance, (2 / 2 / 2) refers to a Pokémon that is both bold and hostile towards humans. It will almost always fight in response to danger.<br><br>A Pokémon's combination of temperament and disposition can be summarized into one of 9 categories, looking solely at whether its values are positive, negative, or 0. The categories are as follows (asterisks represent any value, as response does not factor into this categorization):<br><br><strong><font size="5">Gentle </font><em><font size="4">(- / - / *)</font></em></strong><br>A gentle Pokémon is skittish but friendly towards humans.&nbsp;The Pokémon here are generally friendly with people; however, they are also easily spooked and will run at the slightest sign of danger. This is the category for cautious but benevolent Pokémon like Chansey, Audino, and Togetic.<br><br><strong><font size="5">Wary </font><em><font size="4">(- / 0 / *)</font></em></strong><br>A wary Pokémon is skittish and ambivalent towards humans. The Pokémon here have no particular opinion towards humans, but they are naturally very timid. The Pokémon in this category will react as soon as anything unexpected happens. Pokémon here include Girafarig, Roggenrola, and Scatterbug.<br><br><strong><font size="5">Distrustful </font><em><font size="4">(- / + / *)</font></em></strong><br>A distrustful Pokémon is skittish and hostile towards humans. &nbsp;Pokémon here both distrust humans and want to stay as far away from them as possible. Pokémon like Abra, Ralts, and Hatenna, for instance, belong here. They would almost never try to approach people to attack them, so they will try their best to stay away. Pokémon in this category can be a pain to catch because of this.<br><br><strong><font size="5">Amicable </font><em><font size="4">(0 / - / *)</font></em></strong><br>An amicable Pokémon is nonreactive but friendly towards humans. The Pokémon here generally have a positive opinion of humans, but they won't go out of their way to help people or approach them unsolicited. City dwellers like Pidove will often fall into this category because they are accustomed to people. Generally friendly Pokémon like Tropius and Slowking also fit the bill.<br><br><strong><font size="5">Aloof </font><em><font size="4">(0 / 0 / *)</font></em></strong><br>An aloof Pokémon is nonreactive and ambivalent towards humans . The Pokémon here do not care either way whether or not there are people nearby; on this scale, they are true neutral. While any Pokémon will react if attacked directly, the Pokémon here have a much higher threshold of tolerance before doing anything. Naturally, this means Pokémon like Numel, Xatu, and Slowpoke.<br><br><strong><font size="5">Watchful </font><em><font size="4">(0 / + / *)</font></em></strong><br>A watchful Pokémon is nonreactive but hostile towards humans. Pokémon in this category dislike humans, but not enough so to go out of their way and alter their behavior significantly. Instead, these species will keep a close eye on nearby travelers and be ready to fight or flee if they notice something is off. Pokémon here include Sawsbuck, Nuzleaf, and Nidoqueen.<br><br><strong><font size="5">Friendly </font><em><font size="4">(+ / - / *)</font></em></strong><br>A friendly Pokémon is bold and friendly towards humans. The Pokémon in this category are not only unafraid of approaching humans, but also like being around them as well. Pokémon in this category may help travelers in need of assistance. Also in this group are domesticated species that are naturally friendly with people. An example of the former is Delibird, and examples of the latter include Growlithe and Lillipup.<br><br><strong><font size="5">Curious </font><em><font size="4">(+ / 0 / *)</font></em></strong><br>A curious Pokémon is bold and ambivalent towards humans. They are unafraid of approaching humans but do not have any ill will towards them. Pokémon in this category will approach travelers out of inquisitiveness rather than territoriality. They will not be initially aggressive, though like most species, they can become aggressive if they believe they are in danger. They may also become friendly as well, however, depending on how they they are treated. Pokémon in this category include Natu, Chimchar, and Emolga.<br><br><strong><font size="5">Territorial </font><em><font size="4">(+ / + / *)</font></em></strong><br>A territorial Pokémon is bold and hostile towards humans. &nbsp;These Pokémon will attack nearby humans on sight. Naturally, a +2/+2 is the most aggressive, with lower numbers simply meaning Pokémon with slightly better tempers; a +1/+1 may not even attack immediately if it can scare intruders off with a warning. Examples in this category include Tyranitar, Garchomp, and Pinsir.</div>

<div class="paragraph"><strong><font size="7">Natures</font></strong><br><br>A Pokémon's individual nature also influences how it reacts to stimuli. Specifically, natures can influence an individual's temperament and response to danger. An individual's temperament and response scores for its species and its nature are averaged together a a 3:1 ratio between species and nature; its disposition score is kept from its species.&nbsp;<br><br>For instance, Chansey as a species is scored (-2 / 2 / -2); it is gentle (cautious but friendly) and almost always flees from danger. A Bold Chansey's behavior score would take into account the Bold nature's score of (2 / * / 2) at a 3:1 ratio with its species score. Thus, this individual Chansey has a temperament score of <em>(-2*3 + 2) / 4</em> = -1, and a response score of <em>(-2*3 + 2) / 4</em> = -1. Its disposition score remains 2, for an overall score of (-1 / 2 / -1). This Bold Chansey is still timid, but it is less skittish than other Chansey and may sometimes choose to fight instead of flee when it senses danger.<br><br>Fractional values are also possible with natures. For instance, a Calm Tyranitar has a species score of (2 / 2 / 2) and a nature score of (0 / * / 0). This works out to an individual score of (1.5 / 2 / 1.5); it is still a territorial Pokémon, but it is slightly less bold and likely to attack than other Tyranitar.<br><br>Below are the 25 different natures and their behavior values.<br><br><strong><font size="4">Timid</font></strong>: Much more skittish and much more inclined to flee&nbsp;<strong><em><font size="2">(-2 / * / -2)</font></em></strong><br><strong><font size="4">Quiet</font></strong>: Much more skittish and more inclined to flee&nbsp;<strong><em><font size="2">(-2 / * / -1)</font></em></strong><br><strong><font size="4">Bashful</font></strong>: Much more skittish <strong><em><font size="2">(-2 / * / 0)</font></em></strong><br><strong><font size="4">Quirky</font></strong>: Much more skittish and more inclined to fight <strong><em><font size="2">(-2 / * / 1)</font></em></strong><br><strong><font size="4">Careful</font></strong>: Much more skittish and much more inclined to fight <em><strong><font size="2">(-2 / * / 2)</font></strong></em><br><br><strong><font size="4">Gentle</font></strong>: More skittish and much more inclined to flee <em><strong><font size="2">(-1 / * / -2)</font></strong></em><br><strong><font size="4">Mild</font></strong>: More skittish and more inclined to flee <em><strong><font size="2">(-1 / * / -1)</font></strong></em><br><strong><font size="4">Docile</font></strong>: More skittish <em><strong><font size="2">(-1 / * / 0)</font></strong></em><br><strong><font size="4">Lonely</font></strong>: More skittish and more inclined to fight <strong><em><font size="2">(-1 / * / 1)</font></em></strong><br><strong><font size="4">Rash</font></strong>: More skittish and much more inclined to fight <strong><em><font size="2">(-1 / * / 2)</font></em></strong><br><br><strong><font size="4">Lax</font></strong>: Much more inclined to flee <strong><em><font size="2">(0 / * / -2)</font></em></strong><br><strong><font size="4">Relaxed</font></strong>: More inclined to flee <em><strong><font size="2">(0 / * / -1)</font></strong></em><br><strong><font size="4">Calm</font></strong>: No change <em><strong><font size="2">(0 / * / 0)</font></strong></em><br><strong><font size="4">Modest</font></strong>: More inclined to fight <em><strong><font size="2">(0 / * / 1)</font></strong></em><br><strong><font size="4">Hasty</font></strong>: Much more inclined to fight <em><strong><font size="2">(0 / * / 2)</font></strong></em><br><br><strong><font size="4">Naughty</font></strong>: More bold and much more inclined to flee <em><strong><font size="2">(1 / * / -2)</font></strong></em><br><strong><font size="4">Naive</font></strong>: More bold and more inclined to flee <em><strong><font size="2">(1 / * / -1)</font></strong></em><br><strong><font size="4">Serious</font></strong>: More bold <em><strong><font size="2">(1 / * / 0)</font></strong></em><br><strong><font size="4">Hardy</font></strong>: More bold and more inclined to fight <em><strong><font size="2">(1 / * / 1)</font></strong></em><br><strong><font size="4">Bold</font></strong>: More bold and much more inclined to fight <em><strong><font size="2">(1 / * / 2)</font></strong></em><br><br><strong><font size="4">Impish</font></strong>: Much more bold and much more inclined to flee <em><strong><font size="2">(2 / * / -2)</font></strong></em><br><strong><font size="4">Sassy</font></strong>: Much more bold and more inclined to flee <em><strong><font size="2">(2 / * / -1)</font></strong></em><br><strong><font size="4">Jolly</font></strong>: Much more bold <em><strong><font size="2">(2 / * / 0)</font></strong></em><br><strong><font size="4">Adamant</font></strong>: Much more bold and more inclined to fight <em><strong><font size="2">(2 / * / 1)</font></strong></em><br><strong><font size="4">Brave</font></strong>: Much more bold and much more inclined to fight <em><strong>(2 / * / 2)</strong></em><br><br>In practice, a Pokémon with a score of 2 in either temperament or response can range from 1 to 2 in that score due to nature; a Pokémon with a score of 1 can range from 0.25 to 1.25; a Pokémon with with a score of 0 from -0.5 to 0.5; a Pokémon with a score of -1 from -1.25 to -.25, and a Pokémon with a score of -2 from -2 to -1.</div>

<div class="paragraph"><strong><font size="7">Implementation</font></strong><br><br><font size="5"><strong>Implementing Response</strong></font><br>To implement the fleeing/fighting scale statistically, -2 should correspond to 0% chance of fighting danger, and 2 should correspond to 100% of fighting danger (in other words, a 0% chance of fleeing). A 0 should represent a 50% chance of fighting. Thus, a 1 represents a 75% chance of choosing fight over flight, and a -1 represents a 25% chance of doing so.<br><br>Using the Chansey example earlier to illustrate, 60 in 100 Chansey will never attack as their first response to danger. 20 in 100 Chansey will very rarely attack (Quirky, Lonely, Modest, Hardy, and Adamant Chansey), and another 20 in 100 Chansey will attack 25% of the time (Careful, Rash, Hasty, Bold, and Brave Chansey). Of this proportion, only Bold and Brave Chansey (4 in 100) will be significantly less skittish than normal Chansey. Overall, Chansey as a species will attack over fleeing very rarely, but individuals can display a range of behaviors within this window. On the other end of the extreme, only Gentle and Timid Tyranitar will be significantly less bold than normal Tyanitar and will also less likely to fight, though like all Tyranitar they remain territorial.<br><br><strong><font size="5">Implementing Temperament and Disposition</font></strong><br>To implement temperament and disposition, it is easiest to utilize the nine major categories. The word "react" here refers to either fighting or fleeing, depending on the Pokémon's response score.<br><br><strong>Gentle</strong> Pokémon are friendly but easily spooked. They should react to any sudden or aggressive movements, but should tentatively approach travelers that remain calm and still. More skittish, gentle Pokémon should run further away and be more cautious about potential sudden movements. More friendly Pokémon should begin approaching sooner and more quickly.<br><br><font size="2"><em>Example</em>: A Chansey stays away from a running traveler, but tentatively begins to approach when she rests. When she gets up again, however, the sudden movement spooks it away.</font><br><br><strong>Wary</strong> Pokémon are easily scared off and ambivalent towards humans. They should actively avoid coming within a certain radius of people and should react if this radius is crossed. More skittish, wary Pokémon should have a wider exclusion radius.<br><br><font size="2"><em>Example</em>: A Scatterbug tries to keep a certain distance between itself and a group of travelers. It flees as soon as they unknowingly get too close.</font><br><br><strong>Distrustful</strong> Pokémon are both skittish and dislike people. They should hide or move away as soon as people enter a wide radius around them, and then react as wary Pokémon do when people cross a second radius. The wide first radius should be larger the more hostile the Pokémon is, while the smaller second radius should be larger the more skittish the Pokémon is.<br><br><em><font size="2">Example: A Buneary immediately hops into hiding when it hears people coming. When its hiding spot is found, it immediately attacks.</font></em><br><br><strong>Amicable</strong> Pokémon are friendly but won't change their behavior much around people. They should only react when people provoke them with unmistakably aggressive behaviors at close range (ie: threatening or attacking them). Otherwise, they are not likely to be provoked into reacting. This reaction radius should shrink the more friendly the Pokémon is.<br><br><em><font size="2">Example: A Tropius pays little mind to a nearby group of humans, even when they get close. It is only when it realizes that they are poachers planning to attack it that it begins to fly away.</font></em><br><br><strong>Aloof</strong> Pokémon are both nonreactive and ambivalent towards people. They should only react when people provoke them aggressively at moderate range or act unpredictably at close range (ie: sudden movements close to them).<br><br><em><font size="2">Example: A Slowpoke notices a pair of travelers passing it by. It doesn't mind, doesn't react, and certainly doesn't move.</font></em><br><br><strong>Watchful</strong> Pokémon are nonreactive but hostile towards people. They should react at a wide range to aggressive behavior from people and at a moderate range to unpredictable actions. More hostile Pokémon should have a wider radius of response to both.<br><br><em><font size="2">Example: A Sawsbuck notices a trainer walking through its forest. It watches the trainer carefully; when the trainer flips his backpack around suddenly, the movement spooks the Sawsbuck into fleeing.</font></em><br><br><strong>Friendly</strong> Pokémon are bold and friendly with people. They should approach people from a wide radius and then stay near them without reacting; they may even follow for some period of time. Only overtly aggressive actions should trigger a response. Friendlier Pokémon should follow for longer periods of time, while bolder Pokémon should approach more quickly and from a wider detection radius.<br><br><em><font size="2">Example: A Growlithe runs up to a traveler and follows her for some period of time. It seems happy to see her and isn't fazed by her normal human behavior.</font></em><br><br><strong>Curious</strong> Pokémon are bold and ambivalent with people. They should approach people from a certain radius and stay near them without reacting; they may even follow for some periods of time. Unpredictable and aggressive actions may both trigger responses, however. Bolder Pokémon should approach more quickly and from a wider detection radius.<br><br><em><font size="2">Example: A Chimchar approaches a group of mountain hikers, trailing them from the ridge above. When the hikers signal to their companions below that they have reached the peak, the Chimchar mistakes this for a sign of aggression and attacks.</font></em><br><br><strong>Territorial</strong> Pokémon are bold and dislike people. They should approach people from a certain radius and follow them for a certain distance; they should react immediately once either the person responds back or they reach the person. Bolder Pokémon should begin following sooner with less warning, while more hostile Pokémon should follow for longer. The usual response is to fight, but for territorial Pokémon that flee, they should give chase until the person turns to defend himself or herself, at which point the Pokémon may instead choose to run.<br><br><em><font size="2">Example: A Tyranitar senses a trio of travelers in its territory. It seeks them out based on the sound they are making and chases them away.&nbsp;</font></em></div>
