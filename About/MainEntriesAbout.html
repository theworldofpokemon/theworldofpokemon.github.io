<div class="paragraph"><font size="3">Each Pokémon entry contains the following:</font><br><br><font size="4">- Name<br>- National Pokédex Number<br>- Species Name<br>- Height (ft | m)<br>- Weight (lb | kg)<br>- Abilities<br>- Egg Group</font><br><font size="4">- Evolutions<br><br>Of course, the bulk of each entry is the "overview," which details just that</font><span><font size="4">—a general overview of the species. It is founded upon the canon Pokédex entries and follows them as best as possible; sometimes, when entries contradict over generations or are especially nonsensical, they may be retconned as misconceptions in-universe. However, this has only occurred very rarely, usually only happening when the newer games try to "undo" details from the earlier ones that are no longer consistent with the established canon. The Pokédex entries are then expanded upon with details from the Pokémon's real-world basis or other relevant factors. Scientific papers, mythology, and pop culture all contribute to different entries to varying degrees. Depending on the Pokémon, some information that would normally be included in research notes are instead in the overview, or vice versa. The primary distinction is that information in the overview is usually pertinent to public knowledge; someone that raises or works with that Pokémon will likely be familiar with what is included in the overview. Research notes are more heavily academic, referring to scientific papers or cultural analyses that may only be known to those interested in that field of study.</font></span><br><br></div>
