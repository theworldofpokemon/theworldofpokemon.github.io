<div class="paragraph"><font size="3">The habitat section, as you might expect, details where the Pokémon naturally dwells. In early drafts, it listed specific in-game locations. This quickly proved cumbersome and ultimately subpar, however; not only were lists long, but they were uninformative (if I said a Pokémon could be found in "Unova Route 12" with no link, few people would even know what the habitat looked like). Thus, it was changed to list general environments. While this doesn't give specific locations and regions, I believe that this may actually be a benefit. When making the initial habitat lists, I realized that many species of Pokémon could be found on a route in some games (ie: Red, Blue, LeafGreen, Silver, and Crystal), but not others (ie: FireRed, Gold, HeartGold, and SoulSilver), in a way that simply didn't make any sense. On top of that, the anime and other spin-offs delineate from specific locations as well, making it easier to say "forest" and "desert" than "Route 2" and "Route 111."&nbsp;<br><br>I also believe that the generalized habitats make it easier to see how some Pokémon would interact with others. While not every savanna-dwelling Pokémon will inhabit every savanna, for instance, they likely overlap in many places. Thus, savanna Pokémon are more likely to have ecological relationships with other savanna Pokémon in the wild.</font></div>
