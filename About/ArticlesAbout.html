<div class="paragraph"><font size="4">If this was still an encyclopedia, the "Articles" section would be the optional, supplemental reading. It expands upon tidbits of the Pokémon world that are touched upon in the entries but are mostly glossed over. While the main entries are written from the perspective of an author synthesizing different scientific works to create an easily-digestible synopsis for everyday readers (and the research notes are the same author writing to a scientific audience), the articles are written as if they were pieces in an informative magazine. Think TIME or National Geographic rather than a science journal. They can be wide-ranging in tone, breadth, and difficulty, depending on the subject they cover and the audience they are intended for. They are posed as "guest articles" written by people other than the main author (in-universe, at least, as I still write them) so they can explore different viewpoints on previously-covered topics.<br><br>Stylistically speaking, the first two articles emphasize this "differing viewpoint" style to provide something different from the main articles. The one on life energy is a scientist who, in his free time, is presenting his case about why he believes "life energy" exists beyond mythology and argues his point accordingly. Its intended to be drier than the standard entries; this person is not fervently trying to prove to the world that he's right, but only trying to explain why he believes what he does and justifying it to an audience he believes has the right to be skeptical. This article was intended to be something out of the Pokémon equivalent of a science magazine or the op-ed of an academic website.<br><br>The other article on the National Pokédex was initially tended to be much lighter, more like an entry on a pop science website. I unfortunately lost the original without a save, however; trying to rewrite humor only made it sound forced, so I rewrote it from scratch. It doesn't quite fit the original idea, but I do think it ended up being a reasonable homage to those websites that pop up when you Google historical questions. If you searched "Why is the National Dex the official Dex?" in the Pokémon world, this article will pop up on the top with a thumbs up icon saying, "189 trainers found this helpful. Did you?"<br><br>I don't have a set schedule for writing articles; depending on the type, they can take quite a while or only a few hours. Obviously, research-heavy ones are the former while "fluff" pieces are the latter (the National Pokédex piece fits here, and probably would have only taken two hours had it not been for the two rewrites from two save fails). There will usually be a news update accompanying article additions, so the front page would be the best place to check.</font></div>
