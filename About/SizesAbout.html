<div class="paragraph"><font size="3">Included in each entry is a graphic depicting the Pokémon next to a human silhouette, showing how large it is in comparison. The person used in the comparison is an average male at 1.73 m. The Pokémon are what I affectionately refer to as "smart-sized," meaning that they are resized as best as possible to correctly depict their proportions. What this means is that serpentine and fish Pokémon may be measured by length, avian Pokémon may be measured by wingspan, and so on. This already puts it above the in-game measurements, which take every size as height and render some species horribly disproportioned. Smart-sizing doesn't use a rule-of-thumb when deciding when to use which measurement, however. When it is unclear whether a measurement means height, length, or wingspan, I combed through depictions of the Pokémon in the anime and spin-offs to figure out how it was sized there. Given the large number of winged (height vs wingspan) and fish (height vs length) Pokémon, this took quite a bit of time. <br><br>Finally, the Sugimori art for each Pokémon is used in the charts even when the pose is unideal (as drawing each Pokémon in a static pose would have been a daunting task for a non-artist like myself). This entailed a lot of fiddling around with angles and geometry to render each Pokémon correctly in the pose it is depicted in. The smart-sizing certainly did take a lot of work, but I believe it is the first project that went to such lengths regarding size. Fixing the blurriness of the charts is on my to-do list (since they were converted directly from the e-book and as such are not quite clear); it probably won't get done until the written articles are mostly finished, however.</font></div>
