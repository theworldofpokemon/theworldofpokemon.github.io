<div class="paragraph"><font size="3">This section is rather closely tied with <a href="./TaxonomyAbout.html">Taxonomy</a> (linked here if you wish to read it as well).<br><br>Oddish's Pokédex entry (and a line about Kabutops in the anime) confirms that the Pokémon world does indeed utilize binomial nomenclature. While I initially dismissed this as an instance of the early games being inconsistent with the established canon, the games continued the inclusion of "<em>Oddium wanderus</em>" as recently as Pokémon Y, so I suppose it still is valid (I am aware that they ported all of the old entries into X and Y, but that doesn't change the fact that the Pokédex explicitly gives a scientific name in those games).<br><br>Thus, each Pokémon family probably has its own scientific name as well. It is unlikely we will ever have any more ever revealed, so the ones I have created are more for world-building than anything. Check Taxonomy for information as to how these names were created.</font></div>
