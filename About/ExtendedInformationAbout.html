<div class="paragraph"><font size="3">If the main entry overviews give basic information about a Pokémon and how it interacts with its environment, the extended information in the research notes provide a more technical view. While this isn't always jargon-heavy, the extended information usually discusses some aspect of the Pokémon that may not be immediately interesting to the general public. In general, there are four "types" of information detailed in this section.<br><br>1. Correction of a previous misconception or incorrect scientific hypothesis<br><br>This type of extended information first goes over something about the Pokémon that&nbsp;either the general public or the scientific community believed was true before providing evidence, either existing or recent, that contradicts it. It sometimes coincides with the "evolutionary hypothesis" type, providing a new hypothesis as to where this Pokémon falls taxonomically now that the old one has been disproven.<br><br>2. Explanation of evolutionary adaptation<br><br>This type of extended information focuses on a particular adaptation or set of adaptation that the Pokémon has developed and compares it to its evolutionary relatives to see how or why it may have evolved to be this way. It may also look at examples of convergent evolution to support the idea that adaptations like the one this species evolved are indeed beneficial for organisms in a particular environment.<br><br>3. Highlight of new research<br><br>This type of extended information looks at recent or ongoing research in the scientific community regarding this Pokémon. It usually concludes with something new about the species not included in the overview because it is not yet commonly known. It may overlap with the "correction" type when it disproves something previously thought about the species.<br><br>4. Cultural/mythological viewpoint<br><br>This type of extended information pertains to species of Pokémon that are significant in particular cultures and their mythologies. It may go over what role this species played in legends and how such stories influenced the societies that believed in them. It also often explains how people may have created such tales based upon the actions of the Pokémon in question. Finally, this type also includes sections that go over how the Pokémon is culturally relevant to humans and how it plays a role in human society, whether in the past, present, or near future.</font></div>
