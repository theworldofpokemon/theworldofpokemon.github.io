<div class="paragraph"><font size="3">The “Care” section on every Research Notes page is a brief synopsis on what a trainer should generally expect when raising this Pokémon. It isn’t meant to be a detailed guide on every aspect of the species. In fact, specifics like exact numbers and regimens are intentionally left out, as it is important to note that Pokémon have been shown to be far more variable in personality and behavior than real-life animals; in the Pokémon world, one of the main goals of a Pokémon trainer is to form a personal bond with the Pokemon you are training and adapt to its own preferences and dislikes. The Care section is more likely to suggest that a species is “usually shy and dislikes crowds” without making a broad generalization of all instances of that Pokémon. Of course, things that are actually applicable to the entire species, like being intolerant of water or needing plenty of sunlight, will be noted as such.</font><br><br><span style="background-color: transparent;"><font size="3">Difficulty extrapolates off of the care section and gauges how challenging it would likely be to raise a particular species, given that the trainer is in the proper climate with reasonable access to resources. The former part is particularly important; Ice-types won’t be rated difficult sheerly because they need cold temperatures, for instance. This is because attempting to raise any Pokémon outside of its natural environment will of course be more difficult. City trainers may find it hard to raise Pokémon that rural trainers would be at ease with, and  inland trainers might feel similarly about coastal ones. Trainers should consider habitat before difficulty and acknowledge that raising a Pokémon outside of where it is comfortable will inherently be more challenging.<br><br>​Thus, the difficulty classification refers primarily to two traits: how easily a Pokémon will obey its trainer and how much upkeep is necessary to keep the Pokémon happy and healthy. Pokemon that are both comfortable around humans and low-maintenance are naturally the easiest, while those that dislike humans and also require a lot of intensive care are the hardest; most species fall somewhere in the middle. It should also be noted that the rating relies on the most tedious stage of the family; for instance, while Nincada (and Shedinja, for that matter) are relatively easy to raise, Ninjask are ridiculously difficult. Since most trainers plan to evolve their Nincada, the family as a whole is considered “difficult.” The same applies to the Pokémon where the reverse is true, like the Torchic family; Torchic can be very care-intensive even though their evolutions are much less challenging.</font></span><br><br></div>
